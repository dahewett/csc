<h3><center>May 2005 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>May 31, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
I would like to report sighting the <b>transients</b> in Hood Canal around <b>2pm</b>. We were returning from conducting seabird surveys in Hood Canal near Bangor when we observed two female adults, what appeared to be three sub-adults, and one juvenile. The two adults were breaching and moving back and forth approximately 300 meters offshore from the younger orcas that were very near shore off of Tskutsko Pt. The younger orcas were very active, doing flips, rolls, and tail slaps. At first we thought they were just playing but discovered fresh mammal lungs floating on the surface soon after the pod moved north into Dabob Bay and concluded that they had been feeding. This was our first sighting of these whales and much to our dismay no one had a camera on board that day.  
<br/>Rick Wood
<br/>USDA, Forest Service
<br/>*<br/>
Kathy of Seabreeze Adventures out of Steveston, BC reported a pod of <b>orcas</b>, including 1 large male, southbound in Boundary Pass next to Stuart Island at about <b>noon</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 30, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>2:30-3:15 pm</b>, 4 or 5, maybe all 6 Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>, heading south from Twanoh and half way to Union, traveling and then stopped to play/eat
<br/>Liza
<br/>*<br/>
My family and I saw a pod of 7 or 8 whales that were black or very dark
gray.  We don't know what type of whales they were but they looked very
similar to a porpoise except they were larger. They appeared to be feeding
on fish. We saw them from our back yard in West Seattle looking across to
Vashon Island. They had triangular fins on their backs, but not as tall as that of the Orcas. It was small and very triangular. We never could see any white on them. We got out the binoculars but still didn't see white.   They seemed like they were "fishing" in the channel, sorta "hovering" in the same place for awhile. We could see fish jumping out of the water in front of them. I'm going to guess that it was either a False Killer Whale or a Pilot Whale sighting? Is that possible?  We watched them for about an hour on two separate days - the last being on Monday (May 29) morning about 9 a.m. We saw a school of porpoise on Monday, May 30 as well.  They were tiny in comparison.  
<br/>Lori Branstetter
<br/>West Seattle
<br/>(<i>I wonder if this might be the pod of transient orcas seen in this area recently? although no white was seen by this reporter.....sb</i>)
<br/>*<br/>
Hannah of Kayak Rentals, Union called to say she had a report that the <b>transients</b> had passed the marina at Union approx <b>11.30 am</b> heading towards Tahuya.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, 
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
Once again, members of <b>J-Pod</b> demonstrated the "West Side Shuffle". Later in the afternoon the whales were once again going past Low Island heading towards Lime Kiln. Around <b>9:00 PM</b> tonight, whales still on the west side!
<br/>John Boyd (JB) 
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Elaine Wiley of Gypsy Cove reported the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> heading north at milepost 323, just south of Ayok Pt. at <b>7:10 pm</b>, traveling in calm waters with the holiday boaters gone.
<br/>*<br/>
Paul at Great Bend Charters in Union called to report all 6 Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> off Potlatch, prowling along the edge of the Skokomish flats in the outgoing low tide.
<br/>*<br/>
About Sister's Point we watched about 4 or 5 <b>Orcas</b> headed out of the Canal..both male &amp; female with at least 2 little guys..it was about<b> 3 P.M.</b> playing &amp; chasing seals right up on the beach on South Shore.
<br/>Ron Klemm
<br/>*<br/>
The (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) Orca are just passing through Hoodsport at <b>10:45am</b>. I only saw two.

<br/><br/>
Nancy of the old Oyster Farm at Beacon Point reported that the <b>transients</b> (all six) had passed going north at approx <b>12.30 pm</b>.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, 
<br/>Bremerton
<b>Orcas</b> (Hood Canal Transients) sighted near Dewato Bay in the afternoon, five or six of them, eating seals.
<br/>M. Little
<br/>*<br/>
Vicki Doyle called at <b>8 pm</b> to report a single male <b>orca</b> off Deadman's Bay, west San Juan Island. Behind him she saw a Pacific White-sided dolphin flip upside down in the air, so she was wondering if it might be transients out there. She called back at 8:30 pm to report they were now seeing more orcas, but VERY spread out, only 1 or 2 here &amp; there, traveling 1/2 hour apart, heading south. There have been earlier reports of J's spreading out like this recently, so it's likely them?
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J's</b> doing their thing.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Three <b>orcas</b> were sighted from the beach in front of the Dosewallips State Park at aprox <b>4:00 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0900-1100 Hrs</b> Juvenile <b>Gray</b> Whale approximately 20 ft. in length in Crescent Bay, West of Port Angeles. Great Shore viewing from Tongue Point, Salt Creek County Park (Clallam County).

<br/>Port Angeles
<br/><br/>
<b>May 28, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
We were at Salmon Bank at <b>10:30 am</b> when an <b>orca</b> breached. We saw 6 plus fins in the distance forging in all directions. Minutes later, we were treated to 2 mega-breaches not 20 feet off port while in neutral.  Some tail lobbing and circular diving. One male in the group and no calves.
<br/>Jamie Bails
<br/>Mosquito Fleet
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>7 pm</b>, my husband and I (along with numerous neighbours!) sighted a small pod of <b>Orcas</b> in front of our ocean front homes. We live in Nanoose Bay, BC, just north of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island's east coast. Latitude? Guessing around 49 1/2 - 50 degrees north. There were at least three females, possibly four, and two males. One male was very large, the other a juvenile, we think. We estimate they were 3,000 feet or less off shore. For at least 20 or 30 minutes, they simply cavorted around - the males staying slightly further off shore than the females. The females were circling a small pleasure craft, as though enjoying the company! Several rowboats and/or small motor boats were also in the area to enjoy and observe the whales. 
<br/>Susan Constable 
<br/>*<br/>
Jim O'Donnel called to report the <b>orcas</b> in Hood canal at Lilliwaup, on the west side, heading south at <b>5:50 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Vicki Doyle called again to report <b>orcas</b> off Kellett Bluff at <b>4:30 pm</b>. She watched from a kayak in the distance, saw some breaching, ~20 boats with the whales. 
<br/>*<br/>
Elaine Wiley reported the Slippery Six/Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at <b>4:15 pm</b> south of Ayok Pt. at milepost 325. All 6 were present &amp; heading south. There were a couple of boats with them &amp; a jet ski she was keeping an eye on.
<br/>*<br/>
Vicki called this morning at <b>8:30 am</b> to report a pod of <b>orcas</b>, with one tall fin off San Juan Co. Park, west San Juan Island, heading north 1/4 mile out.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas</b>, (I assume J-pod) about <b>8 AM</b> heading north along the west side of San Juan Island.
<br/>Helen King, Innkeeper
<br/>The Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/><br/>
<b>May 27, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
About <b>11:30 am</b> Mrs. Malpica's 5th grade class from Mary M. Knight School sighted some <b>Orca</b> whales in the water off Twanoh State Park. It looked like they were playing.
<br/>Amber Wood, 11 years old
<br/>*<br/>
@ <b>11:30 am</b> we spotted a pod of 6 <b>Orcas</b> in tahwana state park in near Union. They only came within about 1/4 mile of shore. 
<br/>Cori Wood
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> was once again staying south of San Juan Island, probably to meet the huge flood tides that have been coming in. An early evening out on our boat allowed us to distantly view J's heading East towards False Bay, scattered between 1/2 mile to 1 mile from shore. We last saw the whales continuing east as we headed back to the dock.
<br/>John Boyd (JB) 
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I felt bad for the six (HC <b>Transients</b>) today. We watched them all day, and the recreational boaters have definitely discovered them.
<br/>John Herman
<br/>*<br/>
Hood Canal <b>Slippery Six</b> were sighted across from Hamma Hamma River at <b>5:30 pm</b> Friday evening. They were moving North and putting on quite a show of coming out of the water and lots of play.
<br/>Mina Kyle
<br/>Hood Canal
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Davenport reported a sighting of <b>orcas</b> at <b>2:30 or 3 pm</b>, off Fort Bragg, CA, ~12 miles out, heading north. There were 5 or 6 in the pod including 2 sets of mom/calf, &amp; a mature male further off in the distance.
<br/>*<br/>
We were with <b>J pod</b> this afternoon out pretty far off the west side  of San Juan Island. They were exceedingly spread out and spending very little time at the surface, although there were a few breaches and some tail lobbing. J1 spent a lot of time foraging by himself but joined up with Princess Angeline and her family and started back towards the shoreline.
<br/>Victoria Kirkland, Island Adventures
<br/>Anacortes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12.51 p.m.</b> the Slippery Six (HC <b>Transients</b>) were Between Sisters Point &amp; Twanoh. I broke out from the Skoke Delta Loop into Union around 2.10 p.m. to see the Six across the canal to the northwest appearing to be celebrating with lots of tail slaps and breaching. The research boat had already caught up with them...the whales were off Holiday Beach at 3.02 p.m. Whales passing Dewatto traveling north probably about 3.45 p.m At 4.20 p.m. They started traveling steadily north towards Holly about 5.35 p.m.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, 
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
Elaine Wiley called to report the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> passing by at ~<b>4:30 pm</b>, some on the east side, some on the west side at Ayok Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
Carol Fassett called to report the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> north of Twanoh, heading north at <b>3:50 pm</b>. There were some breaches. There were four boats with them, one of them doing donuts.
<br/>*<br/>
Once I got to Union, <b>2:00 pm</b>, I could see that I found them.  They were doing their after feeding activity - surfacing, while others did tail flaps. By the time I got back to Hoodsport, (2:30), they were still in their playful mood. I watched them to a short while on the far side of the canal just off Tahuya. Then they started "running" North with the research boat in pursuit.
<br/>Harry Louch, 
<br/>Hoodsport
<br/>*<br/>
Howard Wilson called at <b>12:40 pm</b> to report the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> between Sister's Pt. &amp; Twanoh State Park, he wasn't sure of their direction of travel yet.
<br/>*<br/>
Researcher Josh London talked to a boater this morning who reported seeing blows off Foulweather Bluff this morning, no confirmation on what kind of whales or ID's, but it might possibly be the small transient group that's been sighted between S. Whidbey &amp; N. Kitsap this week.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 26, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
At <b>2 p.m</b>. the Hood Canal "<b>Six</b>" were across the Canal from the Hamma Hamma River. They were headed North and were making good time. I was able to follow them with the binoculars for about 15 minutes and lost sight of them when they were close to Holly.
<br/>Mina Kyle
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>transient</b> orcas were spotted here at Cougar Spit about <b>8:30am</b> today, heading south.

<br/><br/>
<i>ID's on Puget Sound transient pod sighted 5/25 (see reports below)</i>
<br/>Thanks for forwarding Tom's photos from May 25. If you haven't already had them identified by others, I can tell you that <b>T065A</b> and <b>T137</b> and possibly T137A (photo quality is not good enough for positive id) appear in the photos.
<br/>Graeme Ellis, DFO, Canada
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen called at <b>2 pm</b>, reporting the "mystery" <b>orcas</b> between Point No Point on northern end of the Kitsap Peninsula, &amp; Scatchet Head, South Whidbey Isl. He sighted at least 3 orcas, but was not close enough to get ID's yet.
<br/>*<br/>
Another report from Tom at <b>2:30 pm</b>, there are 3 female or non-adult males and one juvenile <b>orca</b>, &amp; they are now heading across Useless Bay toward Double Bluff, Whidbey Island.
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>1830</b> hrs, I observed a small pod of (I think ) five female
<b>orca</b> approximately 2 miles SSE of the nav buoy off Scachet Head on south Whidbey. I believe there were two full grown females and three smaller ones. The smaller ones were two thirds the size of the larger ones. They were in the process of killing and feeding on a full sized sea lion. The kill technique was butting the sea lion with their heads at full speed. The sea lion was actually tossed in the air 5-6 feet several times.  After the sea lion seemed dead the larger whales breached several times.
<br/>David Clark
<br/>*<br/>
I just talked to Jim Maya, a little aftter <b>3 PM</b>, and he confirmed it is <b>J-pod</b> cruising up the west side of San Juan Island just below, headed for Lime Kiln Lighthouse.
<br/>Helen King, Innkeeper
<br/>The Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> sighted at the Skokomish Delta at approx <b>9.40 am</b>. <b>6.15 pm</b> all the Six were there traveling northward toward Tskutsko Pt. on the SW corner of the Toanados Penin. They stayed doing shallow dives. They came right up to the Point but unfortunately went along the west side of the Penin up into Dabob. They were sighted for about 10 mins.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, 
<br/>Bremerton 

<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:00 AM</b>, <b>J Pod</b> is near Eagle Point, SW San Juan Island. 
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Whale Watch Charters.
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call at <b>10:34 am</b> reporting 2 adult <b>orcas</b> &amp; 1 calf by Appletree Cove near Kingston.
<br/>*<br/>
Received a message from George Pederson from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab who was at the Saltwater Park Boat Launch. At least 3 of the <b>Slippery Six</b> had been seen near the Skokomish River in the delta at approx <b>9.40 am</b>.
<br/>Judy Dicksion,
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
Adam U called to report seeing <b>J pod</b> while he was doing a bird survey this morning. They were off Iceberg Pt. at <b>9:30 am</b>, spread out &amp; heading northwest, with no one else around.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 24, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Martin Oman called to report seeing a few <b>orcas</b>, maybe as many as 7, at 6 pm near Gig Harbor, in the Narrows heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>orca</b> calves, on the whale watch, we saw <b>J and L pods</b> up close to Victoria BC, there was several new calfs, the guide said 2 from L and I know of one from J, J40...
<br/>Nikki
<br/>*<br/>
I was hiking on the beach at South Whidbey State park (SW Whidbey Isl) and saw what looked like spouting or splashing out in the distance. We forgot to bring binoculatrs, but it could have been a grey whale.
<br/>Deborah Koff-Chapin 
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from Leanne of Seiku this <b>afternoon</b> that a young, small <b>gray</b> whale (~20') was swimming around in Seiku Bay, 10' offshore.
<br/>*<br/>
Judy Dicksion called to say she had sighted a fin off Hazel Pt. in Hood Canal at 10:25 am, &amp; she just heard from Josh London &amp; Steve Jeffries of Fish &amp; Wildlife that they had met up with the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at 11:25 am.
<br/>*<br/>
An <b>Orca</b> pod was briefly sighted from the Kitsap Ferry at <b>7:20am</b>. The pod was about 200 yards off of the southern end of Bainbridge Island, heading west towards Rich passage. I counted at least 4 and it looked like females with siblings.
<br/>Brad Lambert
<br/><br/>
<b>May 23, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
At approx. <b>1330 Js</b> were heading South passing the Fraser River. Ruffles breached off the park while some swam by within 50 feet of the shoreline. At <b>1900</b> they were heading to Rosario.

<br/>*<br/>
Elaine Wiley of Hood Canal called to report the <b>transients</b> near Ayok Pt, at <b>4:25 pm</b> at milepost 323. All 6 were there, rolling, tail lobs, etc. They slowly left at 5:30 pm.
<br/>*<br/>
At the Coal Docks (near Pt. Roberts), just when we were going to give up and go home, who comes to greet us but <b>J-1</b> RUFFLES!  Leading the group, he came by the boat to give us a long, slow pass, and as he got to the front of the boat gave us a nice tail lob to say goodbye. A young juvenile member (couldn't see the patch from the sunlight) did a double breach too! Granny was closer into shore so we just watched her from a distance.

<br/><br/>
<b>J &amp; L pod</b> were reported off Eagle Pt. at <b>12:25 pm</b>, &amp; we rushed down to Hannah Heights just in time to watch them slowly mill by, mingling &amp; feeding &amp; getting to know each other again. We watched from about 1-2 pm, Howie ID'd L41, L57, J1, &amp; noticed some sprouters among the young males. We caught a glimpse of a cute little yellowish spyhop, looking like a possible new calf, also thought caught a glimpse of one of the other mom/calf pairs. Several breaches, lots of tail lobs, upside down-sideways swimming &amp; lots of close passes &amp; likely touchy-feely stuff going on.....with J1's studly dorsal hanging high in the middle of it all. 
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie, Orca Network
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Ron Bates called in a report of his day with <b>L's &amp; J's</b> - sounds like all were having a great time getting reacquainted after the winter. All males were present, L47 appears to have a new calf with her, another calf was sighted, but may have been one of the calves born last fall. The sprouters have sprouted! (young males who are maturing, their dorsal fins showing a growth spurt - sb). L12 was messing around with a young male, and of course J1 was in the middle of it all. Last report had them off Kellet Bluff heading north. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>T61</b> encountered at <b>16:55</b>, in Baynes Channel poking around, and slowly heading SSW. J's heading NW along Pender earlier on.

The <b>transient</b> orcas were sighted by us and the neighbors at <b>5:00pm</b>. They were located along the east side of the canal about 1 mile north of Little Anderson Creek. Or straight east of Hazel Point on Toandos Peninsula. They maintained the same location for over a half-hour, but in the rain we had to give up watching them. There were at least four - seen at the same time - but there may have been more.
We were thrilled since they had not been this far north all these months.

Ron Bates called at <b>4:22 pm</b> to report that <b>L pod</b> had been inbound for the last hour and were nearing Race Rocks. <b>J pod</b> was heading toward Swanson Channel at <b>4 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>15.30-17.30hrs</b>. Four <b>Orca</b>. One adult. One sub adult and two juvenile. Judging by size. I saw the largest throw a seal into the air and the other three converge on the spot where the seal landed. Appeared to be having fun playing with the carcass but did not toss it in the air any time thereafter. Continued to stay in the area alternately diving for periods of up to 7 minutes then returned to same area and just playing.  Unable to see the final direction of travel due to rain. It was also hard to find marking. They did not stay surfaced or would all surface in some sort of gaggle. Prior to seeing the whales a lot of the seals in the area between Anderson Landing and Seabeck left the area or stayed close to shore in shallow areas between the deep water and themselves.  One seal surfaces directly in front or my boat, came completely out of the water before diving. Going a little faster I would have had company.  
Seen at 47.41.03N,  122.45.18W, .8 Mi SE of Hazel Pt. light, .7 Mi SW of range light at Olympic View, S of Bangor Spit.  I was 1.2 miles SW at Anderson Landing. I have seen Orca in Hood Canal before. Some time between 1956-58 Summer in the Hazel Pt. area and around Oak Head.

<b>Gray</b> whale sighted in the vicinity of the mouth of Ludlow Bay (just west of Hood Canal) - spotted approx. <b>16:00</b> around the red 2 nun buoy - was observed until approx 18:00 - during that time it moved towards Tala Point, staying out almost as far as that buoy too so binoculars were definitely required,  s/he got kinda inside Tala point - she surfaced as far in as the Mother/Daughter houses on the hill, then s/he gave us the slip, started moving further on dives, then by luck we spotted it back out closer to the 2 nun buoy.

Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> came by at <b>9pm</b>. They were in very fast travel mode and I only counted three. I think that the three were trying to catch up to the others up north and put it in high gear. They were porpoising out of the water with big splashes headed north around Oak Head, Toanados Peninsula.

<b>Jpod</b> going up Haro this morning and on to Active Pass this afternoon. I was going to go west at 1400 when I got a report of 5 <b>orcas</b> going towards Kelp Reef from Lime Kiln.
These whales were not found but I searched all of North Haro.
A report of a <b>transient</b> off Otter Pt. just past Sooke at about 1530. Next came a report of 2 transients, both male, 1 large one not so big. These animals were 5.25 miles south of Secretary Island (near Sooke) going towards Race Rocks, this was <b>1845</b>.

I'm new to the Pacific NW, so I'm not sure what kind of whale I just saw.  At <b>7 pm</b> a very dark gray/black mammal going west towards Bremerton by Point White on Bainbridge.  Single animal.  Surfacing frequently, more frequently than I might expect.  Posterior fin looked like a fish, kind of ragged edges, smooth bottle-nose-ish.  No white seen, not a glossy black, a dark gray or matte black.  Very close to shore of Point White.  Could be a dolphin, although seemed much bigger than any dolphin I've seen, and much darker, plus I don't recall posterior fin like that on a dolphin.  No huge dorsal fin, I think a small one.  We've seen two orcas traveling together in January or so here, same route.

It was almost <b>12:30 PM</b>, on Possession Ridge. looking east as usual at south Mukilteo, the train line, and the southern end of Saratoga Passage. A large white circle remained on the surface of the water, directly in the wake of the white boat. It had been a breach, and for several minutes we watched as two whales breached several times, sometimes headed north, sometimes aimed right at us. We knew there were two whales because between the breaches we could make out two distinct blows. I wonder if I witnessed a humpback

Kathy in Seabeck reported the <b>Slippery Six</b> were giving her a "private show" right in front of their house at Maple Beach, Seabeck some time around <b>6.30pm</b>. At about 7.00 pm we were there....and the Slippery Six had not slipped away! Again they got into the "piling on" routine with lunges in all directions, a few tail slaps mainly by the youngest (with the white underside of the smallest fluke) and one mature tail slap with plenty of splash. They had generally moved more over towards the mid-channel marker out from Seabeck. We got a few more tail slaps and a spy hop from one Mom and then on NE they went in their usual traveling mode with us losing sight of their fins and blows about 7.35 pm as they  turned to head straight north in mid-channel towards Bangor.

For the third day in a row we watched the Hood Canal <b>Slippery Six</b> from our place on the eastern shore across from Hoodsport on Hood Canal. At <b>5pm</b> at Cougar Spit at least five of the Slippery Six were observed swimming south about 100 yards offshore. They disappeared from view, but twenty minutes later they returned were very close to shore, only about 50 feet off the beach directly in front of Cougar Spit. The larger Orcas spy hopped a couple times and the smaller ones were rolling and tail slapping. Lots of other activity too, swimming quickly back and forth in a tight group and staying up high on the surface. They eased their way north until they passed Red Bluff and disappeared from view around 5:35pm.

At <b>3:10pm</b> we sighted five [HC <b>transients</b>] swimming north in mid-channel directly off of Hoodsport. There were two boats nearby. The five turned and went went south and the boats followed. But they again changed direction underwater (they got away from the boats) and headed north mid channel on the surface in a tight group. The five occasionally shifted to swimming together side by side in a parallel line. A sixth large Orca was much further away from the five and much closer to shore, directly in front of the Finch Creek hatchery. They (at least 5 of them) traveled casually towards Cougar Spit then north to Red Bluff on the east side of the canal. The Orcas and boat disappeared from view to the north at approx 3:45pm.

The Slippery Six Hood Canal Transient <b>Orcas</b> at <b>8:00pm</b>. We initially spotted them almost mid-channel off of Red Bluff (across from Hoodsport to the northeast on the East side of the Canal). A few jumps, many tail slaps, the younger ones were coming up and out of the water a bit and rolling back under. They didnt seem to be in any hurry. By 8:20pm they were directly off of Cougar Spit (across from Hoodsport) and approximately 200 yards off the eastern shore of the Canal. At this point we saw one of the larger orcas taking up the rear about 100 feet behind the others. By 8:30 pm they were beginning to fade from view into the distance, again almost mid channel and just south of Hoodsport.

Around <b>noon</b> there was a pod of <b>orcas</b> in Neah Bay. There were at least two bulls, 4-6 cows and/or juveniles. They were at a distance, so I could not see much in the way of distinguishing marks, but one bull looked like he had a raggedly-notched trailing edge of his dorsal. At the same time, there was at least a half-dozen California sea lions in the marina feeding on halibut carcasses that the recreational fishermen were throwing into the water (in great quantity). The sea lions were really vocalizing. I guess if orcas were transients, they might have come in the harbor to investigate the sea lion activity. Or they were just curious residents.

Remaining at the surface, there was a fair bit of tail-lobbing, an occasional spy-hop, and a magnificent breach as they
traversed the standing waves.  Once they made it past this hazard, the
current was with them and they floated on the surface, seemingly getting a
free ride through the remainder of Active Pass.

About 2 M. north of Alderbrook resort at <b>4:50 p.m</b>., the <b>transients</b> were sighted very close in to the shore (E side of channel). They were playing and demonstrating a bit of all the playful behaviors we most love to  watch, said the earlier viewers on shore. By the time we got there at 5:00 p.m., the Orcas were directly across on the West side of the Channel. They
were surfacing a lot and some tail slapping, spy-hops and other carousing for quite a while as they headed South. We probably saw all 6. My favorite part was seeing the baby jump fully out of the water 3 times.

Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> in the canal at <b>8:30</b> this morning. It was a joyful morning for them. Lots of breaching, rolling all together, fin slapping and headstands with tails straight up in the air. They were first spotted in front of Pleasant Harbor on the west side of the canal.

At <b>2:40 am</b> this morning, they passed just below my house on the west side of the Canal (milepost 333 on Hwy 101, across from  Mesqueti and Bald Pts.), heading north. They made several HUGE splashes (they must have been totally out of the water), several tail slaps,  and one noise like the sound of an oar banging against the side of a rowboat. They also twice made a totally unexpected vocalization that is difficult to describe, but was very loud -- sounded like the low, almost buzzing hum of Tibetan monks chanting (okay, okay...I said it was hard to describe). They continued on their way toward Hoodsport at about <b>3 am</b>.

The whales moved over towards the Kitsap Penin side heading south with the research boat in tow. I lost them at about 12.45 pm still traveling slowly south. Caught sight of The Six et al passing Eagle Creek then lost sight of them as I moved down the road. About <b>2.45pm</b>, I picked them all up near Holly, Kitsap Penin.

<b>8:15 p.m.</b> I was returning from Shelton. The HC <b>Transients</b> were at the mouth of the Skokomish River in an area, I think, named Indian Hole. It is a very deep part of the Skokomish Delta. I counted 5 Orcas. I am guessing the baby was also there. They must have been very active earlier as at least 25 people were stopped watching them. When I got there they were still doing jumps, tail slaps,etc. Their activity after feeding. By about 8:30 p.m. they were starting to work their way North. Since the light was failing I came home.  I had also followed them as they headed South from the Dosewallips area about 2:00 p.m. They were swimming South on the far or East side of the Canal from HWY 101.
