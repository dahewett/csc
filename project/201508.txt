(region-wide record-breaking summer windstorm)

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>7:30 p.m. - </b>Another stunning evening in <b>Haro Strait </b>with members of all three pods in phenomenal, constantly changing lighting. I missed some but I think all of <b>Ks and Js went north</b>. More than I thought are here! Saw <b>L84</b> too. Left them almost at Turn Point northbound spread all the way across Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today was spent with many members of all three pods! Whales everywhere in all directions! I rarely ever spend any time with <b>L pod</b>, so that was a nice treat. There was a lot of socializing going on and the whales were just milling about off Hein Bank. <b>J46 Star</b> (born 2009) surfaced in front of mom <b>J28 Polaris</b> (born 1993), <b>J36 Alki</b> (born 1999) and her son <b>J52</b> (born 2015). In one large group, there were 4 whales hanging out with just their rostrums above the surface and there were some above water vocalizations at this point. There was some snuggling going on and it was a precious moment to watch. A pair showed off some seriously awesome synchronized tail lobbing. Lots of kelping! Today was my first real chance at getting some kelp shots! It was surprisingly beautiful on the water...today the family joined so I'm really glad we had such an encounter with so many whales! -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Trip report: The weather cooperated yet again, and the report was <b>Resident killer whales near Hein Bank</b>!! We headed past a seal haulout with a few pups still hanging out, then onward to Hein bank where we found members of<b> all THREE resident pods</b> - with beautiful calm seas - and unbelievable magnificence as these whales, spread out over several miles, graced us with their presence. Members of J-pod, including <b>Granny, K-pod (K-16 Opus (born 1985, mom to K35), and L-pod</b>, whales seemed to be all over the area. What a treat. After reluctantly heading homeward, we had harbor porpoise swimming very close to us, another treat. Amazing day, again! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:30 a.m. -</b> Had an amazing day on a tour in the Salish sea! Saw <b>orcas and a humpback</b>! There were SO many orcas! Looked like multiple pods! Here's my favorite photo from the day!
We were in the middle of the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca in between Sequim and San Juan island</b>! We were with them for an hour or so and when we left they were still there. We were told there were two different pods. The whales were spread out but there had to be 20 or more of them. A couple babies, and a couple really defined males. They were all very active spy hopping, cart wheeling, and breaching! It was breath taking! -Grace Seidel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Rainblows during a gathering of members of all <b>3 pods in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. -Steve Ellwood

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:50 p.m. - </b> Last visual on one male who was mid channel guy, he surfaced still mid channel <b>Kingston/Point Wells </b>(tank farm) transected, still northbound. Shallow surfaces.
<br/><b>7:42 p.m. </b>- 2nd male mid channel at mid channel yellow buoy <b>south of Kingston</b>.
<br/><b>7:30 p.m. -</b>  spotted an adult male northbound at<b> Jefferson Head...Kitsap side</b>. -Alisa, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Our <b>5:30 p.m.</b>  ferry departing Bainbridge Island just got cut off by<b> a pod heading north back towards Bainbridge Island</b>. So lucky to have been standing in front of all the cars on the floor deck with my two young sons and husband and we actually saw them before the captain of the ferry did and had a chance to cut off his engine. They casually came right in front of the ferry, to the great delight of everyone that caught a glimpse. One of the calves was with this pod, though I have no idea who they were. Awesome experience- we were about 20-30 feet from them and exactly on their level. -Chelsea Morgan Ramsey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:13 p.m. -</b> Just spotted again from an Argosy tour, <b>between Blake island and Bainbridge</b>. Northbound. Too far to identify. -Cameron Quinn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:25 p.m. -</b> Aboard the Point Defiance ferry, just saw spouts <b>north of Gig Harbor to the west of Vashon Island</b>, looked to be <b>heading north</b>. -Neil Hathl

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:50 p.m. - Orcas</b> just went past Salmon Beach, <b>north of Tacoma Narrows</b>, traveling north toward Point Defiance. -Zeno Martin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:45 p.m. - Pod of 4-6</b> heading north past the<b> Tacoma Narrows bridge toward Gig Harbor</b>. -Dale Blackburn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:35 a.m. - </b>My aunt just saw an orca on the southwest side of<b> Fox Island headed out towards Chambers Bay</b>. That's all the information we have. -Kelly Lauricella

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 a.m. </b>- Boating south around east shore of <b>McNeil Island</b>, saw pod of 8 orcas (including 2 males) due west moving SSE on starboard side. -Matthew King

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. - Pair of mature Orca</b>, a large young bull and a female, nosing around the seals on the beach at <b>Cutts Island</b>. Presumably transients. Hunting but didn't observe any feeding. -David Paly

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:58 a.m. -</b> A little bird tells me that there is a large male off <b>Raft Island/Allen Point (Henderson Bay, Pierce County) </b>right now...there isn't much more bay north so he would probably have to head back southbound soon. -Aaron Hart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We received a call reporting <b>5-8 orcas plus a calf in front of Rosario Resort in Eastsound from 5:00-7:30 p.m</b>. "It was quite amazing and unusual to see them in Eastsound".  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

These <b>orcas </b>were viewed from our deck just south of <b>Rosario Resort</b> in the <b>Eastsound at around 5:00 pm</b>. -Larry &amp; Janet Munson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. - Humpback in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> more towards the Port Angeles side but in between Victoria and Port Angeles. We stayed with it for probably 30-45 minutes. We saw it come up 4 times, the first splashing it's large fluke in the water! It appeared to be hunting, doing mostly short shallow dives and couple longer 5 minute dives! At one point made its way over to our boat before doing another deeper dive! -Grace Seidel

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

Today with <b>L-Pod in Haro Strait</b> - I've never seen L's this active! Breaches and more breaches, spyhops and more spyhops, with a bit of belly-flopping, tail-slapping, and cart-wheeling, too! -Michelle Rachel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. - Three Orcas, two male and one female passing Eagle Cove</b> in the wild waves heading<b> south in Haro Strait</b> and moving so fast against the wind! They each breached numerous times. Same group was swimming together Friday evening as well. -Regina Feinberg

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:37 a.m. -</b> The pod came closer to shore, turned and now swimming north, <b>foraging off Eagle Point</b>.
<br/><b>8:49 a.m. -</b> What a difference a day makes! The whales came by Eagle Cove last evening gliding through the glassy water close to shore. The conditions so calm and still, their exhales echoed loud and clear across the water. Wake up this morning to stormy skies, heavy wind and major whitecaps all across the strait. Far off shore I see huge splashes! The whales were porpoising over and through the whitecaps, breaching again and again, the wind carrying their splash high up into the air! 
<br/><b>8:30 -</b> they were <b>headed Southeast towards Salmon Bank</b>. -Lodie Gilbert Budwill

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 a.m. -</b> Woke to the canary-type <b>calls on Lime Kiln</b>. I heard them for over 40 mins. Ls? I recorded it. Very odd to hear those whistles and nothing else the entire time. -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T046E near Race Rocks</b>. -Mark Malleson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:18 a.m. - 2 heading west past Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/><b>11:11 a.m. - At Lime Kiln</b> the last 15 mins, heading east now. Moving fast. -Michelline Halliday 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:21 p.m. -</b> Seeing pod of <b>Orcas in Pickering Passage</b> across from Harstine Point Marina. -Miche Ennis

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:50 p.m. - </b>Looks like they are headed <b>up Case Inlet to North Bay</b> or will they trick us and circle Harstine Island and head toward Olympia. Spotters on the shore up and down Pickering and Peale passages.
<br/><b>11:55 a.m. - Orcas heading out of Hammersley</b>. Waiting to see if they turn toward Olympia or Allyn. 
<br/><b>10:02 a.m. - </b>They are moving up and down the inlet (Hammersley). From Walker Park down to Church Point and back. Thanks for the map addition. -Bivalves for Clean Water

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon</b>: We saw <b>maybe 5 orcas</b> (I think 2 males, a female w/ baby and one other) in front of our place is the narrow part, and deep channel, in <b>Hammersley Inlet</b>. (Shelton) Neighbors in a wider place say they were playing (?) So I just saw them traveling by.  -Meg Callea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon: Orcas just passed under the Harstine Bridge</b> and moved north in Pickering Passage, heading towards Jarrells Cove. Peaceful, gentle sight. Nice to see them without a dozen chaser boats. -Gretchen Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 a.m. - 4 in the group (including one calf) at Hammersley Inlet</b>. -Barbara Andrews

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:00 a.m. - Four or five orcas in Hammersley Inlet</b> just east of Shelton this morning. At least two large males and two or three others. -Thomas Pearson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30 a.m. -</b> We just saw <b>three or four whales</b> off <b>Arcadia point</b> this morning, they were approximately 15 feet offshore. It was amazing. -Cheryl Cerkan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:00 a.m. - In Pickering passage woke up to 4 Orcas</b> slapping their tails heading south towards Olympia. There was one big one and one little one. All 4 were close to shore. They stopped slapping their tails once they got past our home. -Diane Sushak

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:45 a.m. - </b>this morning <b>four orcas spotted coming south through Pickering Passage</b>. Tail slapping and jumping completely out of the water! Beautiful! I thought the neighbors were putting their dinghy or kayaks in the water and making a lot of noise until I looked out onto the water. -Christy Rowe

<br/><br/>

<b>There are seven orcas (three large males and at least one juvenile) in south Sound</b>. They came down the east side of <b>Harstine Island and through Dana Passage</b> to the souther tip of Harstine. They then headed west, passing <b>between Hunter Point and Squaxin Island and around Steamboat Island</b>. They then headed south into <b>Totten Inlet</b>. Milled around to the far south end and then headed back out again. ...following the same locations in reverse. As of <b>6:00</b> they were heading north through Dana Passage. Thrilled lots of fishermen/women in the rain. Scared lots of seals and harbor porpoises. -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 p.m. - 4 Orcas</b> (including at least one adult male) playing in <b>Dana passage</b> where it meets <b>Budd Inlet </b>across from <b>Boston Harbor</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 a.m. - 4 orcas</b>, One of the group of four was a male and they were patrolling the shoreline between two groups of seals approximately 400 feet apart. This activity was on the north side of <b>Violet Point, Protection Island north of Miller Peninsula, Clallam County</b>. It appeared they were feeding and attempting to scare seals off the beach. -Jeffery Corliss

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:18 a.m. - Five Orcas</b> hunted seals near shore in a meter or less near<b> Eagle Island Seal Haul-out in Balch Passage</b>. The large male several times approached the colony which numbered between 80 to 90, with many pups. The Orcas remained in the area near shore for approximately 10 minutes. I did not see the initial strike but from the splash the orca apparently came out of the water. -Paul Proctor

In noticed what looked like <b>2 orcas</b> at the north part of the island, close to the sand spit. They looked interested in the seal sleeping on the beach? Then I noticed 3 more orcas south of the island. All of the orcas were swimming south past Kopachuck State park. -John Falskow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Day report- I had an amazing experience with <b>a transient killer whale superpod</b> that congregated in front of my house.  The night before I was out on my own with the T37As, and the T65As at sunset approaching Smith Island from Lopez Island, so I expected they might be somewhere in northern Puget Sound the next morning.  Sure enough, in the morning I spotted them swimming <b>southward near Lagoon Point</b>.  Later, just <b>north of Bush Point the T37As and the T65As</b> appeared to chase and kill a few harbor porpoise (judging by the speed at which they had to chase)!  The gulls were circling and the celebrating began with tons of tailslaps, spyhopps, and some breaches.  Then I noticed that <b>T102, T100C</b>, and one other male swam in to join the mix and that's when the party really began!  <b>Between Bush Point and Point no Point the killer whales put on an acrobatics clinic</b>, including probably 200 breaches, cartwheels, and lunges!!!  In over 20 years of photographing killer whales this was the most action packed transient experience I've ever seen, without a doubt!  It was so exciting that I was shaking as I took pictures, in total awe of being able to witness such amazing behavior.  At Point no Point the T37As and T65As split off from the others and they swam right next to the beach to make another kill, probably a seal this time, with salmon fishermen watching from the shore.  Then the breaching started up again as they continued to travel southward past PNP.  As I left the scene they were spreading out and appeared to be <b>heading toward Edmonds</b>. -Bart Rulon

Here are a couple of pictures from my experience with the <b>T37A, and T65A pods</b>.  I started with them at the <b>north end of Lopez Island </b>and when I arrived there was a distinct smell in the air as if they had just made a kill.  <b>T65A2</b> spent a lot of time upside down attempting to get frisky.  They swam southward along the western shoreline of Lopez Island, then <b>out Cattle Pass</b> as a tight knit group.  Next they tucked inside the rocks and kelp and aimed toward Long Island.  At the east end of Long Island they finally made a kill on the edge of the kelp, then they breached and played around for a while, followed by a session of logging at the surface as if to decide what to do next.  They turned around and pushed offshore aiming <b>toward Smith Island </b>as they spread out into smaller groups at sunset. -Bart Rulon

As always, it was a great day with the southern resident orcas; however, today we saw something very rare: <b>J35 Tahlequah and her son J47 Notch were babysitting little J51</b> for most of our afternoon trip, and during that time J35 Tahlequah brought a huge salmon over to the boys before she'd eaten it. I love how even though J51 is not her son, she still took the time to let him see, touch, and experience the salmon before prey sharing with her son J47 Notch. What a surreal experience! We also witnessed lots of breeding and social behavior between members of each pod. -Heather MacIntyre

Another windless day and we were fortunate to find <b>both minke and humpback whales</b> - so easy to find in mirror-like sea conditions. First was a minke feeding near <b>Smith Island</b>, then on<b> Hein Bank where we found "Split-fin", a well known humpback whale</b>. He appeared to head straight towards the boat (most likely passed under us) and gave incredible views as he fluked heading right towards us!...(Minke report)...and then - in Rosario Strait - another humpback! No ID on this one, but a delight to see. Such a spectacular day again. -Jill Hein

I'm just returning home from a kayaking trip. I launched my boat from <b>Washington Park</b> around 12:15pm. By <b>12:45</b> I was surrounded by<b> at least 20 whales</b>...They were traveling a decent speed south, riding the ebbing current. Then, one enormous mature orca began bobbing up and down, and one very small orca jumped, followed by a number of other mature orcas jumping. Their crash on the water was heard like thunder claps up and down Rosario Straight. -Kevin Marshall

Day report: ...morning, we headed out in search of orcas. There had been a report by Lopez Island an hour before, so the search was on. We found the <b>T065As </b>tucked in shore on the west side of <b>Blakely Island</b>. They had recently made a kill as there was blood in the water. As we stopped on scene watching them, the family suddenly made a turn straight for us. They popped up right in front of the bow, one of them showing off some of their kill in its mouth right at the surface. They stayed right next to our boat for a few minutes while slowly drifting southwest. During this time, they created about 10 bubble rings beneath the surface (I have never seen this behavior, can anyone tell me how they do it? It almost looked like <b>T065A2</b> was creating them with his flukes but I couldn't tell.) That was an absolute thrilling couple of minutes. We left them as they continued traveling south down the east side of Frost Island and Lopez Island. During the afternoon trip, we caught up with them again northwest of Blakely Island, and followed them for awhile as they continued west through the San Juan Islands. It was a beautiful day where I had a lot of fun just photographing the whales. The T065As never disappoint! -Rachel Haight

 I was out salmon fishing in front of my house in the morning when <b>6 transient orcas</b> come racing down the shoreline with the outgoing tide, headed north.  It was <b>T37As and T124D and T124D1</b>.  I dropped all my fishing gear and photographed the pod as they swam northward.  Eventually they circled and made a kill <b>just north of the Coupeville/Port Townsend ferry traffic lanes</b>, followed by lots of celebrating!  They breached, lunged, spyhopped, and tailslapped over and over before they continued northward.   As they neared <b>Smith Island</b> they went on the chase again, and caught a harbor seal.  I could see at least one other killer whale swimming  off in the distance during my visit, but it never came close enough to the others to see exactly  who it was. -Bart Rulon

Absolutely unreal evening on the water with <b>Js, Ks, and Ls</b>: Big groups of active whales slowly moving north  near Open Bay on Henry Island in flat calm water with evening lighting - can't ask for better than that! At one point the <b>J16s</b> unexpectedly broke off and fanned out through all the boats watching - <b>J42</b> Echo turned on her side as she passed along Serenity, then surfaced right off our stern! It was very special to be able to share this experience with my mom and my niece, too. We left them this evening off <b>Spieden</b> heading slowly north at<b> 7:30</b>. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Late afternoon - The <b>J16s</b> were toward the front of a very large group of whales, <b>reportedly around 60 SRKWs</b>. Families were very intermingled, and many individual members tended to just kill time playing in front of the lighthouse and in the kelp beds on the north side of the lighthouse while they waited for other family members to catch up. The entire passing was at least an hour. Magical.  -Ariel Yseth

<b>4:00 PM - From Land Bank</b>, northbound whales. Amazing experience watching from the bluffs as they streamed by in large groups, stalling out in a line stretched from south LB<b> to Lime Kiln</b>, each group engaging in much surface activity (spyhops, breaches, tail lobs, tactile behaviors) and even heard above surface vocals on two occasions. Stunning! As is usually the case, this whole big beautiful clan of orcas was led by J2 (by a lot) who was more inshore than the others. The <b>J16s</b> were in shore as well but  this pass <b>J26</b> was well ahead of his family traveling along with the leaders. -Alisa, ON

We left <b>Js and Ks</b> southbound off Hannah Heights around <b>7:15</b> tonight - they went up almost to <b>Stuart Island</b> before flipping. I can't believe those other Ks and Ls were MIA today! -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:50-7:10 p.m. - </b>Earlier in the day <b>Js and Ks</b> traveled northbound up island then turned somewhere further up in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Much appreciation to the Orca Behavior Institute for having me along on the water to observe members of J and K pods as they made their way southbound along the west side of San Juan Island in the late afternoon. We spent some time traveling down island well outside of <b>K21, K16 and K35</b> who were traveling in their usual tight group. The rest of the whales were spread out traveling alone or with their families. We continued south to Hannah Heights where we found the <b>K12s, J16s</b> hugging the shoreline powering along in now sloppy seas. Saw <b>J34, J27, L87, J39</b> and others. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b>Orcas</b> were very spread out between <b>Discovery Island and north San Juan Island</b>, they met up and spent the afternoon at <b>False Bay</b> before turning back north, <b>J-2 and J-14 </b>passing closely by Lime Kiln around <b>4 pm</b>. -Ariel Yseth
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:50 to 2:30 p.m. - orcas in front of Lime Kiln</b>. I heard echolocation and a few calls on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>, and also saw them on the webcam. They headed north, and I heard them on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b>, but not well enough to identify the pod(s). Strangely, they were seemingly quiet directly in front of Lime Kiln. Perhaps it was just a hydrophone effect of the boat noise, but I don't think so. -Joshua Glant

...along the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> where our Southern Resident orcas did not disappoint us. Many were traveling north along the shoreline, others further offshore. <b>K-21</b> Cappuccino, <b>K33, K26, J27, J34, J2, J28, L87 </b>and many others were ID'd. Homeward bound we found bald eagles, a Tufted Puffin, and a giant bait ball with hundreds of birds with harbor seals feasting in the middle of the bait ball! A magical day for all. -Jill Hein

<b>6:40 am - </b>from cabin at <b>Land Bank</b>, west side San Juan Island, first spotted an adult male to the south of us with another male, 3 females and a calf milling farther south and/or off shore. <b>J26</b> came north, stalled even with us at about middle Land Bank, breached twice in front of an oncoming cabin cruiser, then continued north a bit closer to us. He then swam in wide circles several times (as if going after salmon), took some long dives, then turned and headed back south, joining up with his family (J16s), all in glassy waters of Haro Strait in the still of early morning. -Alisa, ON

<b>6:30 am -</b> What a beautiful way to start the day! Per-sunrise with the whales at <b>Eagle Cove</b>! At least two pods! Mamas and babies closer to shore in a tight group and many whales spread out as far as my eye can see looking across the strait with purple mountains as a backdrop! Several spy hops, lots of pec slaps and tail lobbing! It looked like the babies were trying to tail lob or do headstands, tiny little tails popping up next to the adults! Whales headed north past <b>Eagle Point at 6:30 AM</b>. -Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:00 am - </b>about<b> 25 to 30 orcas</b> very spread out in groups of 2 and 3 going from <b>Eagle Point to False bay</b>.

A heck of a lot of splashing going on today...Mystic Sea encountered the <b>K13's</b> along with <b>Crewser (L92)</b> in a resting line off <b>Henry Island</b>. Once they resumed traveling northward the whales quickly picked up the pace with numerous cart-wheels, tail-slaps, spy-hops and double breaches creating LOTS of noise and HUGE splashes before tucking in close to the rocks foraging for salmon. Hopefully they found plenty to maintain healthy energy levels. -Sandra Pollard Naturalist

Was it curiosity or compassion? I believe we witnessed Orca compassion for humans today! My husband and I noticed a sailboat with a tall mast pull into Eagle Cove for safe harbor during unexpected lightning. The two people on board anchored the boat and took their dinghy to shore. The lightning passed and the couple returned to their sailboat. We watched closely, ready to help them if needed. Once they climbed aboard, <b>five adult whales and a baby surfaced right next to the sailboat</b>, first port side, then again starboard and a third time at the front of the sailboat, like "Come on, its okay now, follow us"! The larger majority of the pod was far off shore while this tight group hugged the shoreline and swam north<b> past Eagle Point</b>, the sailboat carefully following their lead. Whether curiosity or compassion, it was amazing to witness their exchange so very close to shore! -Lodie Gilbert Budwill

EPIC day with <b>J2 Granny, L87 Onyx, J14 Samish</b>, <b>K26 Lobo</b> and then some. Just off <b>Burrows Island/Fidalgo Head</b>...so no more than 45 min. from leaving the dock! A rainy (yeah rain!), gray day, but really beautiful, and no other boats with us! Every behavior, tail slaps, multiple breaches and spyhops, family groups, close encounters, even a sea snake from one of the young ones! -Bonnie Gretz
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:20 pm -</b> Just saw a pod of<b> 5-6 orcas</b> (including 1-2 adult males) at the northern entrance of<b> Active Pass</b>, they came from Strait of Georgia. Did a spy hop by green channel buoy, then hung out around the mouth of the pass. Appeared to be hunting in kelp a little bit. Then they all surfaced to breathe and disappeared. Not sure if they went in the Pass or not. Saw them from the ferry. -Roland Flutet

Perfect/peaceful night as we watched <b>members of J, K, and L Pod</b> head north and through <b>Active Pass, BC</b> with K14 (mostly submerged) with K42 and K26 (her male offspring); J14 and her daughter J37 who was traveling with her son J49; and J41 with her son, J51 bringing up the back, L55's (L82 and her son, L116 in front) traveling with L95 who was bringing up the rear. Since the orcas were resting (a behavior where they slow, group up, surface often, and alternate different 'sleeping' hemispheres in their brain), we extended our trip an hour so that we would be able to catch them going through the narrow pass... -Heather MacIntyre

Chasing transients from shore requires enormous amounts of patience. Today, I caught up with the <b>T046s</b>. It seemed like they were <b>angled straight for Penn Cove</b> just before <b>1pm</b>, and it was at that time I lost sight of them. Never did find them again. However, <b>5.5 hours later </b>of basically nonstop looking, I was able to find <b>T049A2</b> (the same whale from my close encounter a few days ago) as he entered <b>Penn Cove</b> heading west. After a close pass by shore, I completely lost him AGAIN. I figured I'd ought to check the mussel rafts, and when I arrived, I saw several seals tucked in close to shore who appeared to be watching something. A few minutes later, I heard that telltale blow. I watched this<b> lone whale travel back and forth in between the mussel rafts</b> for 1.5 hours before leaving due to the darkness...It was also quite the sunset too! -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:47 - Two orca just leaving Penn Cove</b>...dream fulfilled, watching orca standing on my deck! No time to run down to the boat ramp. I just caught a quick look as they were a bit east of the ramp, heading east. It was awesome! The closest I've ever been!! -Bonnie Gretz

<b>5:45 pm -</b> This is the orca that was in <b>Penn Cove</b> today. Came up about 10 ft off the beach at <b>Long Point</b>!  Came up close and then headed toward the wharf then circled back around on the oak harbor side heading back south and then we lost it. -Kari Habeck

Our encounters with the <b>T036A and T075B</b> groups of transient orcas have been off the charts lately! <b>They moved into the Salish Sea together up Haro Strait on the August 11</b>, and stayed for a couple of days. There are <b>two adult females in these groups who are nursing calves</b>...We watched them two nights in a row (Aug 11 and 12) as the orcas hunted the waters around the<b> Cactus Islands and Johns Island</b> (north of San Juan Is.). They would go up very close to the rocks and take their fill of harbor seals. Last night I lost count of how many harbor seals they ate! It was inherently sad to see the seals fighting for their lives, but predator/prey dynamics is an important aspect of behavior to document and record. The circle of life must continue! It was great to see the very young calves learning new lessons from their mothers. And, it's been even better to resight the new calf that I had found this spring when it still had fetal folds on it: <b>T036A-3</b>. -Heather MacIntyre

About <b>5:30 PM to 6:05 PM</b>, there were many <b>orcas calling loudly on the Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>! I heard echolocation, some <b>S1s</b>, a couple <b>S2is</b>, perhaps a few <b>S16</b>s, and many <b>S36</b> calls. From that, I think I can conclude that members of <b>J and K pods</b> were in the vicinity of the hydrophone. -Joshua Glant

We had a fantastic visit with the <b>J16 sub pod </b>late afternoon near <b>Eagle Point</b>. (San Juan Island)  <b>J52</b> spent most of his time entertaining himself with lots of rolling around, lunging, and multiple spyhops!  During several of his spyhops he would have various seaweeds in his mouth.  <b>J36, and J42</b> were nearby, but he seemed to be most playful when he was by himself. -Bart Rulon, naturalist aboard Island Explorer 3

Today was hard to describe. We ventured out to the <b>Race Rocks</b> area near Victoria, BC where we encountered <b>J's and some K's</b>.

We observed this animal this evening <b>off Bainbridge Island</b>. We can't figure out if it is a dolphin or porpoise. It had some grey markings on the fin. We never saw the underbelly. Today we say a very large seal - larger than we usually see - also off Bainbridge. -Kathleen and Julie, Yeomalt Point, Bainbridge Island
<br/>(<i>Notes from Jessie Huggins, Cascadia Research: This is a Pacific white-sided dolphin; it looks very similar to one that Dyanna Lambourn photographed near Steilacoom in late June but from these photos  I am not able to confirm that it is the same individual. It is difficult to compare the still photos to the video taken by the tugboat captain, but given the location I think it is likely to be the same one that he had recently seen.</i>)

We spent the evening watching the sunset on the<b> west side south of Lime Kiln</b>. With perfect timing in the fading light, a pod of <b>~15-20</b> passed over the course of nearly an hour. This was the most magical sunset of my life. (And when I talk about babies on the video it's because I adore orcas and get more excited about them than puppies, not because all the orcas were juveniles. We did see two very young ones alongside others, though. -Kathleen Love

Our neighbor spotted <b>3-4 orcas</b> milling about and generally heading south in <b>Useless Bay/Admiralty Strait</b> in the shipping lanes. They were milling around for an hour or so (<b>6:30-7:30 pm</b>). The Edmonds jet boat that goes to Canada stopped and watched for some time (the whales swam up very close to the boat; the boat went dead in the water and just observed). One large ?male plus 2-3 smaller ones. They are too far away to ID. But, we rarely see whales from the Whidbey side of Useless Bay so this was a treat. We lost them as they moved south of the Point No Point Lighthouse.  -Linda Ridder

Onboard Natsilane Monday <b>afternoon</b>, many <b>L pod and K pod family groups </b>were swimming down <b>Rosario Strait</b>. The 7' flooding tide was ending, then a 1' ebbing tide made for calm easy waters. I was able to identify the large<b> L55 family, L92 &amp; L90, L95 &amp; L105 &amp; frisky? L72</b>. (The Whale Museum will tell you their names) The orca were very surface active, vocalizing and chatting! We witnessed all behaviors- powerful breathing, fishing, lunging, spyhopping, breaching, tail-fluke lobbing, pectoral fin lobbing, playing, resting, and whale 'flashes' suggesting mating! These whales made an uncommon choice to follow the ferry route west between the islands, taking their time, holding the attention of awed folks from San Francisco, Mexico, and on the ferrys! A memorable day, the many orca families traveling together, hoping they were getting enough salmon, knowing these whales need our help in restoring salmon abundance for their very survival. -Caroline Armon OnBoard Tours Whales

What an amazing day, we headed out and find whales less than a half hour from port! LOTS of whales! We were so very fortunate to find many <b>members of all three of our Southern Resident community, J-pod, K-pod and L-pod, right beside Cypress Island in Rosario Strait</b>, with dead-calm conditions. Wow, whales everywhere. Some breaching, spyhopping, tail slaps, foraging with many great looks at these whales "in action". We took a break to find some harbor seals, then the whales caught up to us. We left them heading south between Cypress and Blakely Island. What an exceptional treat for our passengers, -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

I've always wanted to be out with whales with a fantastic sunset. Tonight, all the stars aligned. <b>Part of K Pod and part of L Pod</b> were hanging out <b>in the middle of the islands</b>, and after work some friends and I went out to catch up with them on our own boat. They came east and we were able to stay with them until the very last light during an incredible sunset. Such a wonderful night, I don't really have the words. -Traci Walter

<b>K22 Sekiu and and son K33 Tika</b> blew our minds aboard the Island Explorer 3 today in Rosario. They would continually <b>breach on top of a harbor porpoise</b>, and then lift the porpoise to the surface. And after this behavior, the porpoise would swim right next to them, seemingly unfazed. -Michael P Colahan

 <br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 am - </b>This was from the <b>(almost) superpod in Rosario strait</b> just <b>south of Lawrence point</b> this morning.

 <br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K22 and K33</b> were following or almost being followed by the little critter. Had to send these through. They were<b> on the porpoise</b> almost as soon as we got on scene, and last I saw were still nosing it around just before we left. -Andy Scheffler

A unique encounter between <b>K13</b> and Sailor the Dog written up by :GrindTV
<br/>"Kate and Jaycee Butler on Sunday enjoyed a magical encounter with endangered <b>Southern Resident killer whales</b>, especially an adult female who turned upside down to inspect the boaters, and even flipped water onto them with her fluke. But the real connection appears to have been with the Butlers' dog, a yellow lab named Sailor, who wagged his tail and seemed as intrigued by this strange beast in his midst as the orca seemed by his presence at the bow of the Butlers' 22-foot boat."

A spectacular encounter with <b>Southern Resident orcas today off Stuart Island Lighthouse</b>... On yet another glorious day of calm seas and blue skies, members of <b>all three pods (J, K and L) </b>were represented as they headed north in their family groups. We witnessed a number of natural behaviors, milling and feeding, breaching, spy-hopping and tail-slapping, against the stunning backdrop of Pacific Northwest mountain and forest scenery. With the whales having been sporadically searching for food in smaller, spread our groups, it was truly rewarding to see so many of them where they belong - together. -Sandra Pollard (Naturalist)

Lime Kiln must be a magical place where the separation between water and air thins and the orca seem to come in to check us out, as we are watching them. Sunday's <b>morning</b> pass lasted close to 2 hours as somewhere <b>around 65 whales passed the lighthouse</b>. One group of whales made several passes very close to the point where we were watching them. -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Suttles (J40)</b> was one of several whales that came in close to shore this morning, swimming back and forth in front of the <b>LK lighthouse</b> seeming to delight in the kelp and company of her kin. She was swimming with <b>Tahlequah (J35) </b>here and as she passed rolled over on her side so we could see her eye. Whether she was watching us, staring up at the sky, or doing something else entirely it was a moment that will stay with me. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Pretty awesome morning. We headed out on the water at 8:00AM and headed west into Juan de Fuca Strait. We were close to Sooke when a report by Dan and Paul Pudwell via a fisherman came in of<b> six orca inbound off Sooke BC</b>. We ended up with a sub group of<b> Lpod</b> including <b>L089</b>, Southern resident orca. They were spread out over 3 km moving at an average of 4.5 km/hr and dives lasted from 4.5 to 5.5 minutes in duration. We left them heading East at Beacher Bay. -Josh McInnes

Sunday evening (<b>7 p.m - 7:30 p.m.</b>) we watched <b>4 maybe 5 Orcas feeding and swimming along Marrowstone Island's</b> eastern side.

The hunting portion of the tour was at the end of our hour with them so it was around 3:30 pm. It started out very relaxed as they traveled along together. As we were about to leave for the day they decided it was time for a snack and Harbour Porpoise was on the menu. This Harbour porpoise looks to be either a neonate or a late term fetus. Just another example of the circle of life in the wild. I also got a shot of one of <b>T37A's</b> calves bellies. I believe the calf is <b>T37A3</b>, which looks to be a boy, with <b>T37A2's</b> dorsal fin in behind. I am fairly certain of the ID but would only hazard to say that I'm 90% sure. -Ashley Keegan

Today, we caught up with the <b>whales at Bell's Beach</b>. We were looking all around for the whales, when suddenly we clearly heard their blows; they had surfaced behind the trees out of sight. We counted <b>at least 8</b> headed north. We moved to<b> Fox Spit</b> and saw a group headed our way. As they neared, the group split up; 4 came closer to our side. My husband spotted one close to shore headed straight for us. I gave my phone to him and said if the whale comes close you need to take a video (which he did!). This group was ID'd as the <b>T065As</b> by Josh McInnes and the orca who passed close to me is <b>T049A2</b>. What a day! Surprisingly, we lost sight of them after that close encounter, and despite searching for another 5 hours, we never did find them again. Maybe they turn up in Penn Cove tomorrow?

J26 "Mike" today and <b>J52 and J50</b> playing with their aunt/sister, J42. This was right by the north arm of the Fraser River. Right outside of Vancouver. -Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It's been pretty rough out there lately, and I don't know how I managed to get these shots in 3-4 foot chop but here they are! <b>J34 Doublestuf </b>was very playful and breached multiple times, and <b>J27 Blackberry</b> surprised many of the boat with close passes as he foraged with no constancy! -Heather MacIntyre

I was at <b>Lime Kiln</b> and just <b>a few came by</b>, very spread out - travel with some possible foraging. They were far out and sun going down impacting ability to get good ID shots. Except the first one sure looked like Granny with dorsal notch and closed saddle. She was all by herself in front if it was her. Also bull dorsal could have been J27 based on shape. ID photos just a real challenge tonight. -Debbie Stewart

<b>7:45-8:55 pm</b> and still going... Loud <b>calls on Lime Kiln</b>. Early calls sound like L pod and now later calls typical of Js and Ks. -Alisa, ON

<b>12:45 pm - L12s</b> off south end, <b>others heading down Haro from Kellett Bluff, some stayed up by Point Roberts</b>. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:00-7:15 pm -</b> We viewed <b>11 orcas in two different groups</b>. First siting was approximately 48.38.1 N, 122.39.24 W. Both pods rounded the north point of Sinclair; one group of five went straight toward the n<b>orthern tip of Blakely </b>while the other played near the marker<b> off of Sinclair</b> for about an hour (including two full breaches out of the water). This group of six then moved south along the <b>west coast of Cypress</b> chasing jumping salmon. One of these six was significantly smaller and appeared to be older calf/young juvenile. This one was separated from the rest of the pod two separate times. -Cory Marshall

Blustery Afternoon Whale Day. The sun shining and warm, yet windy with a strong 8' flooding tide made for a fun boat ride on Natsilane, through some choppy, tide ripped waters over <b>toward Lummi Island</b>. Folks from California, Finland, and Seattle were up for the adventure! Transient-Biggs, mammal eating Killer Whales, <b>T037A</b> and family were on the prowl, they may have had 2 meals- harbor seal, porpoise? Fascinating the way they were working together, coordinating direction changes, lunging, and tail fluke slapping the water. It looked like a new calf was side by side with matriarch mama T037A! (Jared Towers confirms T37A has a newer calf T37A4, see notes in our Intro/summary) -Caroline Armon, OnBoard Tours Whales

Day report: Some<b> Js and Ks rocketed down Haro Strait</b> this morning to meet up with other whales off False Bay. This afternoon <b>all of J-Pod, the K12s, K13s, and K14s, and the L12 sub-group</b> headed north past Lime Kiln between <b>4:15-5:00 PM</b>. Shortly thereafter, the L12s split off and came slowly back south, making little to no progress against the strong flood tide. When I left Lime Kiln at <b>6:30 PM they were still milling offshore</b>. These Ls used to be such a mainstay on the westside during the summer, but it was my first time seeing them this year! It was great to see them, and to meet little <b>L121</b> for the first time. -Monika Wieland

We had members of <b>all three Southern Resident pods here (J, K, and L)</b>, and I was able to see all four new calves all in the same hour! Not only did the <b>L12's</b> return, an independent matrilineal sub-group of <b>L Pod</b>, but all of the orcas were incredibly social. L41 Mega born in 1977, babysitting his sisters calf, L121 off South Beach, SJI. The first thing we witnessed when we got on scene was none other than L41 Mega (the oldest SR male) spring into a full breach- twice! The vocalizations were incredible. -Heather MacIntyre

A spectacular afternoon watching &amp; talking whales with my grandson from <b>South Beach &amp; Eagle Cove</b>. I think Granny &amp; <b>all 3 J pod babies</b> were out there this afternoon. (confirmed) From shore, we could see salmon jumping too, hope all the orca ate well! Wonderful, many surface behavoiors, continual sightings from about <b>1-3:30pm</b>. Treasured memories with my 2 generations. And I encouraged calling the Whitehouse for breaching the 4 lower Snake River dams, to family, friends, visitors! -Caroline Armon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We encountered members of<b> J11, J16, J17, J22, and J19 matrilines crossing Haro Strait</b>. They were primarily traveling, the hydro was quiet when dropped by the boat. Many spyhops and aerial scans. -Connie Bickerton

<b>Calypso (L94), Cousteau (L113), and a spyhopping L121</b>. Little L121 was very active (just like last time I saw him/her). Lots of tails slaps, spyhops, and even squirting water at mom and sister. It was very cute to watch! Near Eagle Cove, San Juan Island. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

We were out this morning off <b>Oak Bay</b> and saw a <b>large pod of orcas</b>. I believe this was <b>J and K po</b>d traveling together. Big family unit, including a baby. It was just off Oak Bay Marina - they were traveling down from Sooke and headed towards San Juan Island. -Deanna Neumann
