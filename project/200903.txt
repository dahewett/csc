<b>March 31, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Chugging back from <b>central WA coast</b> to the Straits to hide. Observers did manage to get a fleeting glimpse of <b>6-8 killer whales</b> but weather precluded our ability follow.
<br/>Brad Hanson, NOAA NWFSC, on board the McArthur II 
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
One <b>gray </b>in north<b> Port Susan</b> in the <b>morning</b>.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter 
<br/>*<br/>
I'm watching at least <b>4 gray whales</b> in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, feeding off the west side of Camano Island between Elger Bay and Mabana, from <b>5:25-6 pm</b>. They were initially heading north, but now appear to be heading back south.
<br/>Update at <b>6:40 pm:</b> They must have turned back north again, because now I'm seeing spouts just N. of Lowell Pt, off <b>Camano Island</b> State Park.
<br/>Susan Berta, Orca Network, Greenbank, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30 to 5 PM</b>. <b>FOUR gray whales</b> working their way north to Mabana! 3 together along the drop-off, one of which was much smaller, swimming close to a larger one, and often breathing together. The fourth was in a little shallower and seemed to be exhaling just under the surface.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Richard Kell at <b>8:43 am</b>, reporting <b>4 Gray whales</b> feeding in Elger Bay, west <b>Camano </b>Island for the past 3 hours. 
<br/><br/>
<b>March 29, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Patty and I sailed up to <b>Langley </b>over last weekend, and had the joy of seeing 3, perhaps juvenile, <b>gray whales</b> feeding just off the water front park. A high school senior had recently installed a "whale bell" in town as a senior project, and it was happily ringing away.
<br/>Joel Skellie 
<br/>*<br/>
One <b>gray </b>in north<b> Port Susan</b> in the <b>afternoon</b>.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter 
<br/>*<br/>
This evening at <b>5:15 PM</b> we spotted several <b>gray whales</b> (looked like three whales), were near <b>Camano </b>island, first heading NW and then changing direction and heading SE and closer to Whidbey Island. At <b>6:45 PM</b> three whales came from the NW and were feeding in the shallow water in front of our house moving onto downtown Langley at about 7:10 PM.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
Nancy Nolan called at <b>6:50 pm</b> to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> near Baby Island (<b>Holmes Hbr/Saratoga Psg</b>) heading east, and another heading south 10 minutes earlier. 
<br/>*<br/>
Fred Lundahl of <b>Langley </b>called with an ecstatic report of <b>3 Gray whales</b> feeding off the <b>Langley </b>waterfront at <b>6:45 pm</b>. He said the whales were side by side, all entwined with each other, a few hundred feet from shore. They rang the Langley Whale Bell, and 100 people came to the park to watch this magical experience! The whales fed for 15 minutes in front of the Dog House, then headed south, mid-channel, coming back to feed again in front of Boy &amp; Dog Park. 
<br/>*<br/>
You are probably getting constant whale reports now (yup!). <b>Gray whale</b> headed south east about 1/2 mile NE from Baby Island. Seems like it is headed towards beach between Baby Island and East Point. 
<br/>Roger Clark
<br/>*<br/>
We observed <b>a gray whale </b>feeding??, or just swimming along having fun, in <b>Holmes Harbor</b>. It was going along the eastern shore, near the northern end of Holmes harbor, but seen south of Baby Island. The first was mid- day <b>12 to 1 pm</b>, (reported by the neighbors) the second sighting was around 6 pm. They may or may not be the same whale. The <b>6 pm</b> whale came into the harbor a-ways along this shore, then went out again, so we got to see it pass by twice.
<br/>Steve Pearse, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
The sun was just right to be able to watch lots of spouts from<b> two grays</b> as they worked their way from Bells Beach to south of <b>Langley</b>, from roughly <b>4PM to 5:30 PM</b>.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Mabana, Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Watched <b>1 Gray whale</b> at <b>2:30 pm</b>, moving very slow through the water at the edge of a shallow / drop off heading north along the east side of <b>Holmes Harbor</b> towards Baby Island (48 5'6" N 122 31'16"W).
<br/>Garet Keller 
<br/>*<br/>
After we saw the <b>T30s and T49s</b> this afternoon we decided to check out the seals and birds in the Chain Islands in Oak Bay and ended up seeing <b>T14 </b>heading past the islands on the west side of Chatham Island and then N up Haro Strait from Baynes Channel. We watched him from about <b>1500 to 1530</b>.
<br/>Kyla Graham-Kordich, Victoria B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
Eileen Ryan of <b>Coupeville</b>, Whidbey Island called at <b>2 pm</b> to report <b>1 gray whale</b> off Long Pt, off Parker/Marine Dr. 
<br/>*<br/>
Dan Halderman called at <b>1 pm</b> to report <b>2 gray whales</b> in Saratoga Passage between at Bells Beach, north of <b>Langley</b>, and Camano Island, closer to the Camano side heading north. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>One gray</b> 1/2 mile off west point at <b>Deception pass</b> in about 175 of water for at least six hours.
<br/>Terica Taylor, Deception Pass Tours, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Just in from a great trip on the water with Mark Malleson. So nice to be in the sunshine for a change! We encountered <b>9, possibly 10 Transients</b> between <b>2-3pm</b>. Certainly the <b>T49A's</b> and the <b>T30's</b> were ID'd by Mark, and were seen frolicking around together. We came across them 5 miles south of <b>Trial Island</b> and they certainly were very happy Orcas. We saw lots of happy behaviours , including fluke lobs, breaching, cartwheels and spyhops. They even motored over to us at one point and some of the animals disappeared beneath us.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic POW, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called at <b>2:15 pm</b> to report the <b>Transients </b>were 5 miles south of <b>Trial Island</b> near Victoria, heading north slowly. There are 9 of them, identified as the <b>T30's and T49A's</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called to report hearing faint <b>Transient </b>calls on the <b>hydrophones</b>, and sighting a pod of Transients from shore about 5 miles south of Trial Island at <b>10:30 am</b> - there appear to be 6 or 8 of them. 
<br/>*<br/>
I am hearing <b>Transients </b>on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone's</b> right now.....<b>12:50pm PST</b>
<br/>Barbara Ellingsen
<br/>
<b>1220 pm</b> - hearing same faint calls again on <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b>, just like earlier today. it was reported to me by Jim Maya that there were <b>Transients </b>about 3 to 4 miles south of Trial Island.
<i><br/>and an update: That previous alert was from a sighting of the Ts at about 11:30, so sounds like they have moved back up a bit. I had heard them at 8:40/9:15/9:39/9:59/10:20/10:50/12:20
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>and another update: As reported by Scott Viers, the transient calls were made from 25 km away from the Lime Kiln hydrophones, establishing a new long distance record for detection of orca calls.
<br/>Howard Garrett</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:03 am:</b> faint calls on <b>Lime Kiln hydro</b> - just tuned in...
<br/><b>10:21 am:</b> Transients? Calls are still faint.
<br/>Annika@Shoreline
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0955</b>: Unusual <b>transient</b>(?) KW(?) calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone now. (from Jeanne via Jeff) Recording up soon at OrcaSound.net .
<br/>Scott Veirs/Jeanne Hyde
<br/>*<br/>
Orca <b>Vocalizations </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> right now (<b>8:55 am</b>). Sounded perhaps like Transients.
<br/>John Boyd, San Juan Island

<br/><br/>
We went back in the Strait of Juan de Fuca to get out of high winds on outer coast that came up in afternoon. Although we were able to stay with <b>Ls </b>acoustically into early morning hours their calls were only intermittent and then we started to also pick up calls from transients. Shortly thereafter all we had were transient calls and visually located a large group <b>Ts </b>- about 30 - in the <b>Pt Grenville area</b> (No. of Moclips). We stayed with them for a couple of hours. Preliminary IDs from Dave and Candi include <b>T74, T36s, T36b (with a new calf), T50, T63, T65, T65b, T68s, T73, T73c,d,CA195, T99with 3 kids</b>.
<br/>Brad Hanson, NOAA NWFSC, aboard the McArthur II 
<br/>*<br/>
I picked up the <b>T49A's</b> (<b>Transient orcas</b>) this afternoon westbound in Race Passage (<b>Race Rocks</b>) swimming against a big flood tide.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>3 pm</b> while walking the dog above <b>Hidden Beach (N. Greenbank)</b> I saw a <b>gray whale</b> moving north up Saratoga Passage. It blew nine times then fluked as it turned in toward Whidbey. About ten minutes later it appeared to be feeding along the shore just north of Hidden Beach.
<br/>Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Greenbank, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
For the last 2 days what appears to be a cow and a calf <b>gray whales</b> have been feeding about 500 yd off shore between <b>Deception Pass and Rocky Point</b>. One big blow with flukes and one very small blow side by side.
<br/>Bill Barnes
<br/><br/>
<b>March 27, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>7:30 pm</b> and three <b>gray whales</b> went wizzing by... the fastest near shore swim-by we've seen in our 8 years here at the west end of First St. The whales are headed for downtown 
<b>Langley</b>... those peeps east of us, keep a look out... tis getting dark but you will still hear them. 
<br/>Sharen Heath, LANGLEY 
<br/>*<br/>
Last night at <b>7:20 to 7:35 PM</b> we watched <b>three gray whales</b> feed in the shallow water NW of <b>Langley</b>. The whales were feeding right next to each other literally belly to back, rolling against each other (do you think this is social behavior or does it help them feed? Maybe a combination?) as they worked their way SE to Langley.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6pm</b> - Friends who live on Saratoga Rd, about 5 miles north of <b>Langley</b> village, just telephoned a heads- up that about <b>5 gray whales</b> are headed east toward Langley.
<br/>Sharen Heath, West end of First St, Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:25 pm.</b> <b>L pod</b> off the <b>Columbia River plume</b>. We detected them acoustically first... it was very exciting to find them. We lost them again last night since they were quiet during our last visual sight and traveling south along the 20 fathom line pretty much for most of the afternoon (3/26). We had to go deeper after dark because of all the fishing gear out here. We continued south to overshoot where we thought they might be by morning and then did tracklines back up north. The visual team found them again off the Columbia R plume this afternoon (<b>14:25</b>). The crew just deployed the small boat and the whales are grouped up, resting and haven't made a peep so far. Our current lat/long is 046deg 21'51.5460"N, 124deg 41'411.3200"W.
<br/>Marla Holt, NOAA Fisheries NWFSC, on the McArthur II 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:30am</b> - Two <b>grays </b>in north end of <b>Port Susan</b> feeding in shallow water just north of Kayak Point. About <b>8:30</b> they headed west toward <b>Camano Island</b>.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Point  
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
This afternoon was a "Welcome the Whales" ceremony at La Push on the Quileute Reservation. There were <b>gray whales</b> off of First Beach for most of the ceremony. Two maybe, maybe more......The kids came ashore. And exactly then, about <b>2:30 PM</b>, a pod of <b>orcas </b>appeared. I was too excited to get the binoculars or camera pointed at them, or count them, or do anything useful; but my first impression when they were closest was that the dorsals looked like transients.
<br/>Miriam Bobkoff, Port Angeles
<br/>Update: Looked in the camera this morning, and found that I actually accidentally got a tiny bit of a picture of them. Useless for ID, but they are at least evidence that it really happened. Even the Quileutes and visiting members of tribes to the north were amazed that there were orca. Not normal for First Beach.
<br/>Miriam B., Port Angeles 
<br/>*<br/>
This will be my first attempt to put into words what it was like to be in attendance at the Quileute Tribe's second Whale Welcoming Ceremony yesterday. Hundreds of humans and numerous <b>gray whales</b> gathered at the mouth of the Quileute River in a wondrous display of tribal regalia and ritual, and cetacean frolicking and feasting. There were prayers, songs and dances that were answered with spyhops, rolling backs and waving fins. Most of the humans were from visiting tribes...standing awestruck in their beautiful capes, watching the grays gathered close to shore. The Quileute Whale Callers, three men in cedar bark hats and capes, recreated for a new generation a very serious rattle chant...walking slowly toward the water...calling to the whales. The Quileute children did many dances, the descendants of the whaling families were honored, a new whale/man mask and dance had their spellbinding debut, stories were told, neighboring tribes were thanked. 
The final part of the ceremony was this: two young teenage boys pulled a small raft made of sticks , covered with cedar boughs, down to the beach. A salmon was placed on the cedar and the boys, encouraged by the crowd, pulled the little gift of food out into the gentle surf. As the raft floated on it's own, riding the little swells out into the bay, I kid you not: <b>THREE ORCA DORSAL FINS</b> BROKE THE SURFACE STRAIGHT OUT FROM THE RAFT!! The crowd had its' collective mind blown! The grays were still close in, stage left, while the raft floated straight out toward what seemed to be a large male dorsal fin in a tight group with at least two smaller dorsals fins showing. I was juggling three cameras...one digital, and two that need the film developed. I can let you know if I caught the orcas and the salmon gift...I may have. Still in a state of magic- hangover.....
<br/>Margaret Owen.. 
<br/>*<br/>
Lucky to be out once again with Mark Malleson, to encounter <b>6 Transients</b> south of <b>Trial Island</b> on the way toward Discovery Island, between <b>3-4pm</b>, The <b>T10's</b> were ID'd by Mark . The bull was travelling with three 'exotics '...not sure who they were at this time. Possibly, T10 and T10C were seen farther off by themselves.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic, POW 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:45-6:30</b> - 2 miles southeast of <b>Kelp Reef, Haro Strait</b>.
I saw a splash way in the distance over toward Kelp Reef. Sure enough it was the wayward <b>Transients</b>. They had made a kill and were very active. We left them at <b>6:00</b> two miles southeast of Kelp.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
I had the <b>T26's</b> and the <b>T10's</b> south of <b>Discovery Island </b>this <b>afternoon </b>heading north for Haro Strait.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
I went out to the edge of our bluff after dinner just in time to watch 2, possibly 3 <b>gray whales</b> dining in the shallows just south of the Mabana Rd. Lots of flukes and fins. They had already passed us by unobserved as they were so close to shore. Lots of seagulls feeding on the left overs. There had also been at least one gray mid channel towards Langley around the middle of the day.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Mabana, Camano Isl. 
<br/>*<br/>
Our encounter with <b>L pod</b> off <b>Westport </b>today: Spent entire day with them as they were heading south - left them off Long Beach - too far inshore to take the Mac II at night so will have to try to relocate in AM.
<br/>Brad Hanson, NOAA Fisheries NWFSC, from NOAA Ship McArthur II 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:30 am</b> - <b>L pod</b> off <b>Grays Harbor WA</b>. We found L pod on the 4th day at sea!!! The NOAA ship, McArthur II ran into all of L pod just north of Grays Harbor WA. in the middle of the night last night (~<b>0330</b>). We lost them acoustically but then found them visually and acoustically in the mid morning and were able to deploy the small boat (RHIB). The whales were spread out and traveling south most of the day. Brad and the rest of the crew got photo IDs and some prey samples, stayed with them day until <b>1830</b>. Last visual sighting was at dusk when they grouped back up and became quiet. Hopefully we will stick with them through the night to get more samples tomorrow.
<br/>Marla Holt, NOAA Fisheries NWFSC, from NOAA Ship McArthur II 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Al Pazar, a crab fisherman, who had 3 different <b>orca </b>sightings from <b>~2:25 pm</b>: 
<br/>1) <b>1 male orca</b> off <b>Ten mile Creek, OR</b> 44 16 00 N, 124 08 00 W in 14 fathoms of water
<br/>2) <b>3 non-male orcas</b> ~ 2 miles north of above sighting, at 44 14 00N 124 08 25 W, in 14 fathoms
<br/>3) <b>a pod of 3 - 6 orcas</b>, just above <b>Sea Lion Caves OR</b> at 44 10 50 N, 124 07 75 W, in 9 fathoms.
<br/>All were heading north, and within 1 mile from shore. Numerous gray whales were also observed. 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Officer Minges, USCG, reporting a pod of <b>~5 orcas</b>, including 1 male and 1 juvenile, heading north off <b>Florence OR</b>, 44 01 21 N, 124 10 44 W, at <b>10:50 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Don Burnett, reporting <b>3-4 orcas</b>, including 1 male at <b>Cape Perpetua, OR</b>, S. of Yachats, at <b>2 pm</b>, circling near his crab boat &amp; heading slowly north 1 mile from shore. He also saw <b>30-40 grays</b> during the day, the grays were traveling 1.5 miles offshore. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Steve Morton of Camano Island called to report <b>2 or 3 Gray whales</b> in <b>Port Susan</b>, 50 - 100 yds. off Beach #2 at Country Club, Camano Island at <b>4 pm</b>. The whales were heading <b>south</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
It's <b>11:05 AM</b> and I just spotted a couple of <b>gray whales</b> heading <b>Southeast </b>near <b>Camano Island</b>. They are diving deep, showing their flukes and moving right along towards Camano Head.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
Nancy Nolan of Whidbey Island called to report a large <b>Gray whale</b> off Baby Island Heights, <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, heading E toward Langley at <b>5:28 pm</b>.

Orca Network received a call from Mr. Gardner reporting a <b>gray whale</b> in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, 100 yards off Race Lagoon, heading south at <b>2:50 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
The Island Explorer 3 ventured up into <b>Port Susan</b> this morning (around <b>11:45</b>) where we found <b>4 Gray Whales</b> (#49- our old friend Patch, #22, #383, &amp; #723)!! When we first arrived the 4 were swimming fairly close to one another, then Patch made a sharp change in direction heading southward toward the north end of Gedney Island. The other 3 whales moved towards the mainland shoreline where they proceeded into 10 ft of water! We watched in awe as they rolled to their side sending a pectoral fin high in the air and half of their fluke breaking the surface! Eventurally they peeled off the shallow bank heading upwind of us, giving our guests a whiff of their stale breath!

NINE Gray Whales ID'd in Northern Puget Sound 
<br/>
I wanted to provide a quick update on the identification of gray whales in the northern Puget Sound area. This has been a very good season with whales showing up earlier than normal and a higher number of different individuals identified early in the season than has generally been the case. Thanks to assistance of Island Adventures that have hosted some of our researchers, and photographs submitted to us by several people, we have confirmed 9 different identified gray whales in the region in the last month (starting 23 February). These include ID # 21, 22, 44, 49, 53, 56, 383, 531, and one new individual. The first 6 of these represent whales first identified in 1991 and 1992 in our first effort in this region. 
<br/>
We have had some reports of some possible additional individuals present but have not received photographs to confirm this. At present 8 of the 10 individuals listed in our photo-ID guide available on our web site have been confirmed present.
<br/>
We continue to welcome receiving any identification photographs of individuals especially if you think you have seen an animal not on the above list. Best,
John Calambokidis, Research Biologist, Cascadia Research

<br/>
Thanks to all who have submitted photographs of gray whales this season, and to Island Adventures for their great reports, and Cascadia Research for the update on ID's. Keep 'em coming!

There was a small <b>gray whale</b> lazing about in the bay between Tongue Point and the mouth of Salt Creek on the <b>Straits of Juan de Fuca</b>. We observed the whale for at least an hour between <b>1700 and 1800</b>. It sounded slowly making several passes thru the area just outside the kelp line on the south side of the point. We never saw tail flukes, but it raised its barnacle-encrusted head once to look around.

<br/>Jeff Perkins, Oak Harbor, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
In <b>Mukilteo</b>, we noticed a whale heading north. It seemed to be playing. It would occassionally come to the surface and we could see it blowing water from it's blow hole.

Barb Jaksa saw <b>3 gray whales</b> in <b>Possession Sound</b> from the <b>4 pm</b> Mukilteo/Clinton ferry. 
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a marine mammal spout about three times within a five minute period. It was a single animal with a pronounced spout visible from a quarter mile or so away. We did see its back as it sounded and there was no dorsal, so my guess is that it was a <b>gray whale</b> rather than a minke or orca. <b>3:10 PM</b>, about one quarter mile offshore, just North of Pt. Partridge buoy, and heading North.

[More Mariners Cove Gray Activity] At <b>10:30 AM</b> a <b>gray </b>was right out in front. Next 5 minutes or so we saw nothing. Then, farther out, about 100 yards, two spouts.<b> Two grays</b> appeared. Stayed for a few minutes, as they were only passing through. Neighbor who had informed us of grays, had first noticed one coming from the southwest close into shore, so they had turned around and now, were heading south towards Rocky Point (Camano). They stopped 1/4 mile from shore off, Camp Grande, near Rocky Point. Localized spouting for about 15 minutes. Then, spouts continued south possibly towards Harrington/Race Lagoons south of Coupeville.

While making coffee this morning at <b>ten am</b>, I stuck my ear next to the open window "just to check", as I do every morning, to see if I heard whales, and I heard blows! <b>Two grays</b> were coasting North, slowly, close to shore by our house near <b>Polnell Heights</b>; then they turned around near the Mariner's Cove community and headed back South mid-channel, picking up speed.
<br/>Catherine Beard, Oak Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
Just spent 45 minutes (<b>~9-9:45 am</b>) watching <b>two gray whales</b> on the east side of Polnell Point (5 miles east of Oak Harbor). They are within 100 feet of the shoreline. 
<br/>Steve Rothboeck, Crescent Drive, Oak Harbor, WA
<br/>*<br/>
I spotted <b>two whales</b> trolling ~<b>7:45 AM</b> this morning in <b>Langley </b>harbor; one much larger than the other; I don't know if the smaller of the two was a "baby," as this was my 1st whale sighting and I'm completely ignorant or their biology. The smaller of the two surfaced every 30 seconds or so, while the larger one, trailing behind, only surfaced once during the 10 minutes I watched.

I just saw gray whales off of <b>NW Langley</b> about an hour ago (<b>6 am</b>). Now, at 7:00 AM there is <b>one gray whale</b> feeding in the shallow water NW of Langley. It is really foggy out and I can't tell if this is one of the earlier whales or not.

Orca Network received a message at <b>5:50 pm</b>, no name or phone number given, reporting <b>2-3 orcas</b> off <b>Hwy 1</b> at Power pole # ?6, a few miles from the Lighthouse. They were looking at one of the Center for Whale Research's posters with our number on it, but Ken said there are several Lighthouses on the CA coast where he posted signs on poles, so we unfortunately have no further clue as to where this was.

<br/>*<br/>
I live on Colvos Passage at Point Richmond in Pierce County, WA (we look across the passage to <b>Vashon Island</b>). Our house is just N of #6 Marine Marker. I saw what I am almost certain was a <b>gray whale</b> traveling South in Colvos Passage toward Delco Wall at approximately <b>3:50 p.m</b>. Whale was traveling - coming up to blow every 2+ mins. Whale's body was visible only once from my vantage point. No fins or tail visible.

I did venture out at <b>2.15 pm</b> and you would not have believed the sudden change in the weather in five minutes. The wind changed directions and we were hit by a squall with 6-7 ft seas, but we did see <b>J pod</b> and one of the new calves for five minutes, then it was head back to the safety of the Victoria Harbour. The Orca were motoring real fast as they headed out west. 
<br/>Marie O'Shaugnnessy, Victoria, B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson of Victoria called to report <b>J pod</b> spread out off <b>Victoria</b>, heading west at <b>11:50 am</b>.

<br/>Cathy Bacon, Texas
<br/>*<br/>
Hearing calls on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at <b>10:43 am</b>. Interesting the sound difference in the 2 links, one called Orcasound and one called Lime Kiln - Very strong boat noise on Orcasound, but LimeKiln can hear the calls. It's cool to be able to figure out which direction the boats (and whales!) are going.

I was lucky enough to be out on Mark's 'Mallards' Zodiac again yesterday with POW and we encountered the <b>T30s</b> east of <b>Race Rocks</b> along with another female, thought to be, <b>T172</b>. They were generally enjoying the calm seas and favourable weather with a little foraging on the side. Although we believe they were after a seal we never saw any remains of the prey item.
The youngster T30C seems to be a male as he was easily sexed when waving his fluke high out of the water.

<br/>*<br/>
Amy Carey called to relay a report from Argossy Tours of Seattle - they were anchored off Alki Pt. with a group of students and saw the orcas (<b>J pod</b>) head by going north across <b>Elliott Bay</b> at <b>11:15 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:58 pm</b>. Just started hearing lots of <b>J pod</b> calls on the <b>Port Townsend hydrophone</b>. Seems like they may be getting closer... Will post recording to OrcaSound once they pass.

<br/>*<br/>
I finally saw some fins at <b>7:30 pm</b>, just as it was starting to get dark. They were just coming into view from the south of <b>Bush Pt, Whidbey Island</b>. All I saw was a very tight group of fins-no backs, just fins sticking out of the water, very close together. Probably four or five. They were moving slowly and were pretty close to our side. I never saw more than that, altho I kept looking till dark.
<br/>Elsa Leavitt, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
I saw the <b>orcas </b>heading north past Hansville at around <b>5:20 pm</b>. They were mid- channel and moving at quite a clip. I cropped the images but if you zoom in the big male fin has some pretty distinctive markings (definitely J1/Ruffles!) . Looked like 3 whales traveling together.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=236038&amp;id=79401335600&amp;saved#/album.php?aid=235289&amp;id=79401335600"><b>Photos here</b></a>.

<br/>*<br/>
The Island Explorer 3 first found <b>Gray Whale #356</b> just west of Gedney Island moving slowly at around <b>11:30 am</b> - there abouts! Due to the whale simply sinking back into the water it was quite the challenge to get an ID, but patience paid off in the end! After leaving for a spell to check out some Bald Eagles we ventured back to find <b>Gray Whale #383</b> moving from the Snohomish River Delta toward the south end of Gedney Island! This is the same whale that last April spy-hopped 7 consecutive times!!

A kind neighbor called with the news last night, today we checked for ourselves: it sure seems early, but at least <b>two grays</b> are feeding in <b>Clallam County's Crescent Bay</b> , west of the Elwha River. A large white-faced whale was easily seen in an aerial-type view from a bluff at Salt Creek County Park. Very near shore in the shallow east side of the bay. A blow could be simultaneously seen on the west side of the bay. The white-faced whale had almost no barnacles in the dorsal hump area , but a white patch on each side of the top surface of tail flukes, and heavily barnacled blowhole area. First gray whales of the year for us!

<br/>*<br/>
Despite choppy seas, spotted [<b>gray</b>] whale spout at <b>4PM </b>today southwest of Polnell Point (<b>NE Whidbey Isl</b>), from a Crescent Bay beach. Spouts appeared localized for about 45 minutes. Drove to a bay just northeast of Polnell Point and at <b>5:15PM</b>; same <b>gray </b>came into bay. Then, headed mid-channel northeast, towards Utsalady on Camano and Mariners Cove. Drove home at around 6PM and saw more mid-channel spouts off Mariners Cove.

The Island Explorer 3 was heading northbound up <b>Saratoga Passage</b> when we spotted a couple of blows off in the distance! Their blows were only lingering moments before the wind flattened them down, giving us just enough to spot them from a couple of miles away! We found <b>#53 &amp; #531</b> swimming side-by-side heading south with consistent respirations that produced a few great opportunities to capture that quintessential Gray Whale fluking photo!!

I received a call from my son on the sv Nelle Bly. While under sail at <b>1:05 PM</b> off of the NE end of Clements Reef, between <b>Patos and Sucia Islands</b> they were overtaken by two adult <b>Orcas </b>and a tiny calf. The mom and calf passed very close to them and they estimated the calf to be apx 4-6' in length. The other Orca was a bit further away so they were not able to closely observe it.

Mark Malleson spotted splashing and fins offshore of <b>Ten Mile Point</b>, Vancouver Island (Gulf Islands, south of Nanaimo) at <b>1015 AM</b> and notified me that it looked like <b>Transient killer whales</b> beating up on something in Haro Strait. I cast off from Oak Bay in "Orca" at 1043, and found the whales near Fulford Reef at 1058 still beating up an animal that was an adult male Steller Sea Lion weighing approximately one ton. The <b>T100's, T101's and T124's</b> were explosively ramming and tossing the sea lion into the air, while adult male <b>T102</b> and sub-adult male <b>T97</b> circled in the background. The whales were being very careful to avoid being bitten or slashed by the canine teeth of the sea lion, and were mostly hitting it from behind or below. At <b>1140 </b>it was all over for the sea lion and the young whales began breaching while the adult females submerged for minutes at a time. The males appeared to be involved in sex play, and the gulls swirled and dove for sea lion scraps. I left them south of Discovery Island at 48 degrees 23.42 minutes N by 123 degrees 12.2 minutes W in a sloppy ebbing tide.

I was lucky to be out on this special day, for it was an awesome day with a group of <b>transients</b>. These animals were spotted north east of Ten Mile Point by Mark 'Mallard' of Prince of Whales, who was on shore earlier at <b>10.30 am</b>. They appeared to be hunting a sea lion. We later found them again on the 1pm Zodiac trip south of Sea Bird lighthouse. They were very active and appeared to be cleaning up a kill as were the gulls all around us. The transient identity by Mark and Ken Balcomb who was also out on the water, were the <b>T100, B, C + D. T101, A + B, and T102</b>.

One <b>gray </b>heard my wishes/desires this evening at dusk. Was feeding a squirrel around <b>7:15PM</b> and was going inside when I heard familiar spout. Turned around and saw single gray very close into shore. After another spout, swirling/swishing started, dinner was on. Walked along the beach until dark; as gray slowly headed southwest towards <b>Polnell Point</b> in north Saratoga/Skagit Bay. Feeding, steadily along the way. Any regulations about 'walking' too close to whales along the beach? I was walking well under 7 knots. Cheers,

We had at least <b>three Grays</b> at <b>Bell's Beach</b> at<b> 6:15pm</b>: 2 adults and possibly a calf swimming very tight side-by- side. They came across the passage towards Bells Beach directly infront of us then turned to head S. towards Langley. Despite fluking (only two flukes- again possibly indicating the third may have been a calf), they were never down more than a few min. Usually when we see a fluke they are down longer. Three spouts were always within a second of each other - 1,2,3. At one point we thought there was a fourth adult following about 50' away, but maybe an adult circled around. I know Patch has been hanging with just one other- so either more Grays have arrived, or there's a "new arrival" Gray.

At about <b>9 AM</b>, there were 2 whales feeding in front of our house (NW of <b>Langley</b>, Whidbey Isl.) It looks like one of the whales is #531.

<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>3:00pm</b> we saw one female <b>Gray </b>and her recent newborn swimming north between Possession Point and the Mukilteo shipwreck. Taking their time and staying on the surface. We watched them for about 45 minutes. We saw two other spouts in the distance but were unable to identify them.
<br/>Rob &amp; Cassandra Miller, Mukilteo, WA 
<br/><i>It's very difficult to determine the gender of gray whales (unless they roll over), and the grays that visit this area typically are males or whales that don't have calves with them, though that can always change! We have had one whale in the past that is smaller than the others, with a smaller spout, that looks like a calf but is just a smaller adult. With photos, Cascadia Research can verify if there are any mom/calf pairs present this year, so send us photos if you see this pair - thanks! sb</i>

At about <b>8:00 AM</b> this morning <b>2 gray whales</b> were feeding in the shallow water NW of <b>Langley</b>. They then swam out and back again and fed more in front of Langley. The whale bell was rung and it sounded like a number of people saw the whales that continued to work their way to the southeast.

We finally got to see <b>some grays</b> today! While walking Sweet Pea around the neighborhood, I took a peek over the edge of the bluff north of <b>Greenbank</b>, &amp; instantly saw a spout &amp; at least 1 gray (possibly 2?) below, feeding close to shore at <b>5 pm</b>. One small boat was drifting along nearby watching, &amp; it appeared the whale was heading south. So we went home for binocs &amp; camera, &amp; received a call there were also 2 whales south of us. We headed out to our neighbor's bluff - unfortunately the whale I saw earlier must have turned back north as it was nowhere to be found, but we did finally spot 2 whales across the entrance to Holmes Harbor, just north of Baby Island at 6 pm. It appeared they were feeding close to shore, difficult to determine direction of travel.

Sandy Dubpernell relayed a report from Marsha Berquist at <b>6:41 pm</b> from Fisherman's Alibi (next to <b>Dines Point</b>) about a <b>[gray] whale </b>of some sort that kids had spotted and thought there was a problem -like it was trying to beach itself. Marsha looked and saw two whales not that close to shore, but in fairly shallow water. They were making sounds and fussing around in the water.
<i>Often when the grays feed, they are very close to shore, and look like they might be stranded - but they are usually just feeding in the shallow water, often with their pectoral fins, fluke tips, and sometimes their sides exposed above the water - sb</i>
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>6:30pm</b> my daughters (Shelbie, Madelyn, and Ava) and I spotted a grey whale out in front of our house.(<b>Greenbank</b>, off of Dines Point) We watched him swim around, he was possibly feeding.

This morning at <b>8:50 AM</b>, we watched <b>2 gray whales</b> off the shore swimming towards <b>Langley</b>. It was very wavy and windy.

One of the whales looks like ID #531. I'm not sure about the other one. One of the pictures is a partial fluke and that might be ID# 383.

We were walking the dog on the beach at <b>Greenbank </b>this evening, &amp; brought along binocs just in case.

I just spotted two <b>gray whales</b> already past my house, headed for <b>Langley </b>and continuing to the SE. They were close to shore but I could not tell if they were feeding or not.
