Just another killer day in the Salish Sea! Today we had <b>15 Bigg's Killer Whales </b>munching on Pacific Harbour Seals for over two hours. - Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

On the <b>morning</b> of March 31st we were able to catch up with a group of <b>15 transient (Bigg's) killer whales heading north quickly up Trincomali Channel</b>.
Thanks to Ian from Gulf Island Safaris and Simon from Ocean Ecoventures for the heads up. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We caught up with about <b>15 transient killer whales</b> on our 10am trip today! We had multiple breaches and tail slaps!!! - Maria Chantelle Tucker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I just got a phone call from a girlfriend in the<b> Pacific City OR</b> (between Tillamook and Lincoln City) parking lot. She believes she's watching <b>an attack on a gray whale by a small pod of transient killer whales</b>. The gray whale is moving very slowly, in between struggles, on the inside of haystack rock. It appears small, and there may be a large gray whale nearby as well.  She sees an unknown number of killer whales. She positively confirmed only two gray whales, which are currently spy hopping nearshore. She couldn't identify any male killer whales. She isn't sure how many killer whales are present, but it looks tentatively between 3-6. She's still standing by with a scope and is going to try and get some pictures and is going to take notes on the encounter. - Michelle Fournet

Sneak peek!!! <b>T65A with her newest calf!</b> Photo taken from Clover Pt, Victoria, BC - Marcie Callewaert

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The <b>T065A's passed through Oak Bay</b> south bound and headed west along the shoreline of Victoria.  We watched  them harass a river otter in<b> McNeil Bay</b> and then predate on a probable seal in Ross Bay before continuing west past many onlookers at Clover Point. - Mark Malleson, with Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Saxe Point, Esquimalt. Now. Half dozen orcas</b>. At least one very small one. Spy hopping and cruising along. - Andrew Paine

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Another group of t<b>ransients were spotted off Race Rocks today at 4:15PM. T049As.</b> - Megan Flood

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 - Three groups of whales, about 10 altogether,</b> were seen off <b>Yellow point close to Roxton island</b>. One female with a baby then two groups of 3 or 4 travelling south towards <b>Ladysmith</b>. - Karen Green

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:00 AM - Orca family.</b> A family of one male, one female and one juvenile was seen this morning around <b>9:00am </b>swimming west through<b> Active Pass</b>. - Andrea Mann

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I managed to skip out for a few hours to do a midday sea watch at<b> Bodega Bay</b>. Soon after settling in and scoping <b>about 1:00 pm</b>, I saw spouts about a mile off NW of the head. Just as I was thinking they must be California Gray Whales at this time of year, I saw one whale breach completely out of the water. <b>They were Orcas!</b> I counted <b>around 20 animals with 2-3 males </b>with the tall large dorsal fins. <b>The pod slowly made its way south in the direction of Pt. Reyes</b>. I and many tourists whom I shared my scope with to get them on their first whales, observed the pod for an hour before they got lost in the sun's glare as they headed south. Several breaches as well as tail slapping and spy hopping were seen. Several times I saw Orca swimming belly up!!! Black and white upon their bellys and tail, White around the eyes. Curiously, there were<b> 2-3 California Gray Whales much closer to shore during the Orca passing</b>. - Scott Carey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:50 pm - </b>Unknown caller reports <b>a pod of 3 killer whales in front of Anchor Bay</b> (80 miles north of Pt. Reyes), jumping out of the water.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 - I'm on Fox Spit Rd on Saratoga passage</b> and we are watching what we think (after googling information) is a mating ritual. The whales have been fairly <b>stationary with their fins up out of the water</b> for about an hour now. Very interesting!! Location: Whidbey Shores, Saratoga Passage -Keegan Porter
<br/><i>Note: the description resembles feeding behavior. Mating is believed to take place in Baja California, Mexico.</i>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We're seeing <b>3 Gray whales feeding in Port Susan near Tulalip</b>, headed south at<b> 6:30 pm</b> onboard the Mystic Sea for our Langley Whale Center fundraising cruise! A little rain isn't dampening our day! - Susan Berta

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Patch (gray whale #49)</b> and a companion just passed by <b>Kayak Point. 3:30pm</b>. - Gary Lingenfelter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Watched <b>2 grays off south end of camano state park from 2:55-3:25</b> as they headed north up Saratoga passage. Spouts and dorsals, no breaches or tails. - Krista Paulino

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">March 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

Very happy to see <b>Dubknuck #44 today, also Patch #49 and #383, and 2 more whales</b> we couldn't ID because of the wind, waves AND rain! Near Langley (#44), Hat Island mid channel (#49) and Tulalip shores (#383). - Jill Hein

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 am - </b>Dick Snowberger reports seeing <b>blows of gray whales from the Clinton ferry</b>.

<br/><br/>

The Salish Sea was sure alive today. The day started out with reports of <b>150 Pacific Whlte-Sided Dolphins in Haro Strait</b>. We left the dock and headed for the dolphins when I got a call from a crab boat with a report of<b> 4-5 Orcas</b>. The crab boat captain is none other than our captain Lance Underwood who was working his other job. We decided to skip the dolphins and head for the orcas. By the time we got to the orca <b>there were 10 animals with a very new calf</b>. After watching them for a few minutes I started scanning for other Orcas and sure enough I saw many more blows about two miles from us. <b>We had two large groups totalling approximately 20 animals spread over two miles.</b> After spending time with the first group I turned around and couldn't believe it, there were <b>30 Pacific White-Sided Dolphins following the mammal eating Killer Whales.</b> They were very worked up and left the area very quickly after picking up the Orca. <b>The new calf is T065A5</b> and the <b>believed mother is T065A </b>who was born in 1986 and now has four offspring. We also got to see another new calf T049A4 who was first documented earlier this March. It so great to see the Bigg's Killer Whales and the Salish Sea thriving this spring! **Please note all of our images are cropped and taken with a telephoto lens** - Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:08 pm - </b>the Victoria Clipper encountered the <b>T49A'</b>s this evening between <b>Eastern Bank and Protection Island</b> (Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca). They were headed straight toward the mouth of Admiralty Inlet/Point Wilson. - Justine Buckmaster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Pacific White-sided Dolphins</b> bow-riding the Western Prince from above and under the water! Shot with two GoPro cameras, one mounted to the hull, another on an extension pole, this video was filmed in the San Juan Islands. - Chris Teren

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Wow. Wow. WOW!!! Over <b>150 Pacific White-Sided Dolphins</b> not only swam with our boat, but followed us <b>through John's Pass!!!</b> (between Stuart and John's islands, about 200m wide in spots). Flat, glassy water made taking pics and video super amazing! Pics and video shortly!!! - John Boyd

<br/><br/>

This morning at <b>10:40 a.m. while hiking in East Point park, I observed 2 transients</b> off the east end of<b> Tumbo Island (just north of East Point, Saturna Island),</b> close to shore, heading west along the Georgia Strait side of Tumbo. I observed them for several minutes until they disappeared behind the land mass of Tumbo. - Robert Bruce

SPOUTING NEWS - ST. PATRICK'S DAY GRAY VISIT  For the 2nd straight year, <b>Mariners Cove</b> was treated to a<b> St.Paddy's Day Gray Whale</b>.This Springtime Gray visits Mariners' Cove each year.

This was the largest group of <b>Pacific white-sided dolphins in Haro Strait</b> Captain Rush had ever seen, and the most playful. He said they zigzagged around the boat, rolling on their sides to get a good look at passengers before rapidly dispersing. Then, in a flash, they'd be back, or maybe it was new ones, taking turns to observe these big orange mammals bobbing in the surface world. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching
