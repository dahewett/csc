<br/>
We did a wide sweep south and west and eventually caught up with a group of <b>three humpback whales off of Becher Bay</b> (ten miles SW of Victoria). Three is pretty much the largest group we see humpbacks traveling in. So I immediately thought that it might be the same trio. Upon closer inspection we concluded that two of the humpbacks were the same, but they had a new buddy! Again, this is pretty typical of humpbacks; they're not social, and they don't form long-lived bonds. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

As we were returning to the harbour we were paralleling the <b>Coho ferry (Victoria to Port Angeles) when we spotted Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> riding her bow! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">October 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

 We found <b>humpbacks! Three of them! </b>Now, that might not sound like a lot, but remember, humpbacks are not social whales. They don't travel in pods (that's a dolphin thing). They congregate in large numbers around their breeding grounds and in their feeding grounds, but that doesn't make them social. They don't travel with the same individuals for long periods; mothers and calves are rarely seen together after they're weaned! There were two big ones and one small one, so it was likely a mother and calf pair, and another one, apparently just hanging out. These guys appeared to be actively feeding as there were massive bait balls ALL OVER THE PLACE. Gulls and Common murres just going crazy over schools of bait fish, and humpbacks going right through the middle of it all. Quite the sight. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/>

On my likely the last working day on the Western Prince (for the season), we were treated to amazing weather,<b> Pacific White-sided Dolphins, and 3 Humpbacks </b>that breached just as we started to pull away. Just amazing today! - Traci Walter Photography

<br/><b>5:15 - </b>now getting dangerously close to several gill netters off <b>Kingston</b>. Hope they don't get too wrapped up. 
<br/><b>4:55 - </b>The leader is heading north 'tween Meadow Point and the Old Degaussing Station, <b>closer to Kitsap side fetching Apple Tree Cove</b>. Waaaay closer to the Kitsap side! - Ben Blankenship

I wish they would stop gill netting in the sound for the safety of those beautiful animals. - Margaret Steen

<br/><b>1:04 - </b>The group I saw an hour ago is back in the same spot, off of <b>Rockaway beach on Bainbridge</b> just south of coastguard marker. Crazy! 
<br/><b>12:14 -</b> I just saw four. 2 males, 2 females milling and slowly drifting south from my house above Rockaway. Just went out of view. This may be a big group! I saw the four at <b>11:50-12</b>. Out of view south just after that, but you'd be able to see them from <b>Rockaway</b>- I just have a big tree in my way. The were def. closer to Bainbridge. I was watching from the beach from 
<br/><b>10:15-11:15</b> and saw them spread out, the leaders of the group south of<b> Alki lighthouse</b> and a male back by <b>Magnolia</b>. Was surprised to see them again. It's really choppy so it's hard to track. They could have turned back or I think there's a good chance that it's a big group spread out... - Heather Polverino

It sounds like this is a pretty big group. Granny's clan leading <b>as far south as Fauntleroy about 12:15</b> when I stopped watching. It's just after noon and they are approaching Fauntleroy now. Very hard to see from Bainbridge though. Still widely spread out, but moving slowly southward.

<br/><b>10:47 -</b> Okay, got em. Mid channel-- Argosy with them 
<br/><b>10:30 - Bainbridge side- Rockaway</b>. ferry riders should get good look. Some foraging. It's so blustery out here! Hard to see. I saw one <b>breach in front of Space Needle</b>. Can't find now. - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0850 .. </b>Currently watching Orcas straight out from <b>Fay Bainbridge Park</b>, Bainbridge Island .. mid-channel. LOTS of surface activity but very little breaching and spy hopping. Slowly drift southwards. They are in front of a large white ship that is staying back from them but observing. - Tim Cuddy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Approximately <b>8:40 pm</b>, a <b>male humpback whale</b>, made feeding sounds over the Lime Kiln hydrophones. - Jeanne Hyde

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hands down one of the best humpback encounters I have ever had. Spent the afternoon with <b>at least NINE different humpbacks between Stuart, Moresby, and Pender Island</b>. They were socializing, wrestling, breaching, pec slapping, tail slapping, cartwheeling, kelping, aerial scanning, tail waving, lunging, and rolling!!! Never seen anything like it!! - Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This morning Mark went east from Victoria and picked up <b>a mother and calf humpback in Haro Strait</b>. The mothers and calves are getting harder to tell apart from the pairs of adults we sometimes see. The calves have grown so much since the beginning of the season! Which of course is what we like to see! Out west there were <b>like 5 humpbacks between Victoria and Race Rocks</b>! Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:05 am - </b>Just spotted <b>a humpback whale off Mandarte Island</b>. - Josh McInnes  

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>4:50 - </b>seeing a couple from <b>Kingston ferry terminal</b>. - Travis Miller

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:20 pm - </b>Roxanne Dalla Pozza called to report a good sized pod, including young ones, was sighted 1/4 miles south of the Eglon boat ramp (near Kingston) heading south between Eglon &amp; Kingston.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:40-4</b> - one very large male - heading south from <b>Point No Point,</b> very fast rate of speed. No longer visible here. - Diane Russell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Good job Steve Smith and Durand Dace- it was cold and very wet at <b>PNP</b> but we were SO BLESSED with Orcas swimming south at a good clip in small groups of 2-4, a porpoise pod, harbor seals, and a river otter. Did anyone catch a clear photo of the large seabirds that were fishing about 50 yards off the beach? Trying to i.d., have not seen them before. I did not have my camera of course Nice to finally meet some fellow Orca enthusiasts in the field. - Donna Green Van Renselaar

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:22 - </b>We're seeing whales at <b>Point No Point</b>. - Elyse Margaret 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>	
	
Distant spyhop seen from <b>Point No Point</b>. - Steve Smith	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:25 - </b>I believe all or most orcas are now south of the <b>Hood canal entrance</b>, along the north shore of the Kitsap Peninsula between Foulweather Bluff (earning its name today!) and Point No Point. But the rain and clouds have taken over, can barely see the water now - hope they travel close to shore further south so we know what direction they go after they pass Pt. No Point! 
<br/><b>2 pm - </b>saw first orcas here off our place just <b>south of Bush Pt</b> - more reported by Jan Bell and Elsa Leavitt coming down from Bush Pt. Unfortunately pouring rain and diminishing visibility have arrived with the whales! But seeing lots of tail lobs,direction changes and foraging behavior - no wonder it has taken them so long to get down here! That is GREAT news, as it appears there are a lot of fish for them out there - yay!! - Susan Berta

What a treat! A graceful parade of <b>Southern Resident orcas in Admiralty Inlet</b> today. We saw porpoising, spy-hops, numerous resounding tail-slaps, breaches and waving pecs as they made their way steadily south past <b>Lagoon Point</b> around <b>12:30 pm</b>, some in small groups, others a little more spread out, with a few foraging stops along the way. Good to see so many people enjoying the magnificent spectacle of our iconic whales in the wild, hopefully finding plenty of food on their travels. - Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island

It was such an intense day! It really felt like fall out there.....choppy seas, cold wind, baker covered in snow and, of course, WHALES! Got to hang out with none other than my favourite group of Biggs, the <b>T137's with the T36A's right outside of Active Pass</b>, in the Strait of Georgia. They spent most of the encounter hunting a seal. The matriarchs and the big guy, T137A, stayed out for the most part and let the kids do the work. It was amazing to see the school of carnage take place before our eyes. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<b>Humpbacks just south of Victoria.</b> There was a pair travelling very quickly in no particular direction. They were a bit all over the place initially, and had the unusual habit of showing their flukes on the second breath and then not diving. While odd, this worked out great for us because we got twice as many looks at the flukes, which are everybody's favourite part of the humpback. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

We saw <b>at least 12 different whales</b>! Peak <b>humpback</b> season is still in full swing as we approach the end of October. These guys are obviously finding some good feeding areas and filling up their stomachs before they head south. Humpback whales all over the world split their time between the high latitudes in the summer months (far north or south) and nearer the equator in the winter. They only feed while in the feeding grounds, so they need to eat as much as they can before they head for warmer, but nutrient poor waters. This amazing migration will begin any day now, and it won't be until July that we see these remarkable mammals again. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

<b>Humpbacks</b> were all over the place and being super social! Humpbacks are not social whales like orcas. They generally travel alone, although occasionally join up into feeding groups, and of course congregate in large numbers in their breeding grounds. But it's always a treat for us to see multiple humpbacks together, and today there was hardly a lone humpback to be found! From the Victoria waterfront we found them instantly! Two here, two over there, three over there. Blows everywhere! The water looked like it was steaming. Jeff estimated there were <b>at least 12 whales</b> in the immediate area! All the whales were behaving differently; we had some doing long dives and showing off their flukes. Others staying much longer at the surface, but keeping their flukes hidden. The flukes we did spot revealed a few newcomers to the area!  - Jennifer Dickson

Brad Hanson of the NW Fisheries Science Center was with <b>J pod, K pod and some of L pod </b>today from Three <b>Tree Point (south Burien) back north to West Point </b>(north of Seattle). He didn't see any foraging behavior. The whales spread out into groups separated by 1/2 to 3/4 mile by the time they reached the north end of Vashon Island. They may not have found enough chum salmon to continue south as they normally do and and return northward up Colvos Passage. Instead they turned around near Point Robinson.

The Southern Resident Killer Whales visited <b>Vashon Island</b> today! Here are a couple of them (mother J22, born in 1985, and her son J34, born in 1998) swimming within yards of Point Robinson, with Mount Rainier towering in the distance behind Des Moines. 
<br/>
A classic "ID shot" of<b> J26 Mike</b>, showing his tall, straight dorsal fin and open saddle patch. J26 was born in 1991, and as he matured into adulthood, his dorsal fin "sprouted" from a short curve into this magnificent shape. At the same time (not shown here) his pectoral fins grew larger and more powerful, and the tips of his tail flukes curled downward. These changes make killer whales one of the most sexually dimorphic species.
<br/>
<b>J38 Cookie</b>, born in 2003, is just starting to sprout his dorsal fin. It will continue to grow taller and straighter in the years to come, helping to identify Cookie and his family. K13 Skagit strutted her stuff with a big cartwheel at Point Robinson this morning! <b>10 am - </b>They turned north again, closer to east side. - Meg McDonald, Wild Northwest Beauty Photography

My hubby and I were out on the boat and saw<b> 2 humpbacks</b> very briefly. They were a couple of miles south of <b>Point No Point</b> in the shipping lanes. They surfaced, spouted a few times, then dove one at a time, showing us their flukes. Then they disappeared into the fog and we didn't see them again. However, we did see many, many harbor porpoises feeding. One even leaped into the air with a fish in its mouth. A great day on the water! - Cassandra Miller

Morning reports had <b>a couple of humpback whales just south of Race Rocks</b> Ecological Reserve and eventually we were able to spot one, just southwest of Victoria!

These guys were spotted hanging out together regularly last year, and seem to be in cahoots again! Both born in 2006, and both with fin anomalies that makes them easy to ID, Split Fluke and Split Fin are some of our more commonly seen humpbacks. Today they were travelling slowly south, doing short dives, and fluking beautifully in the late afternoon sunshine. It really was a sight to behold. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

A <b>right whale</b> was reported heading west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, at milepost 8, which is 8 miles east of the Makah reservation at Neah Bay. Jerry George, nature writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, saw the right whale from his window at <b>5 pm</b>, about 1/4 mile from shore by a kelp bed. It had a 3' gash in the blubber layer along its upper left side about midway between the blow hole and peduncle. He saw the white collosities on the rostrum and there was no dorsal fin. He was not able to take any photos.
<br/>According to Wikipedia: "The Northeast Pacific subpopulation, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 50 animals... According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth."

My husband and I have seen many sea otters in Clayoquot Sound, and they have been reported around Pt Townsend, but not down into Puget Sound.  Such a delightful discovery! - Katie Bunnell
<br/><i>Kim Merriman reports: We have had at least one sea otter in Eld Inlet each of the past several (3-4) years. I have him/her on film and on video. The sightings have been reported each time to the proper agencies. And it is very cool to see them</i>.

<b>5:00 PM - Orca off Pender</b>. Watched between <b>15 and 40 orca heading nw off west Pender south of Thieves Bay</b>. Three plus groups. First group about 5 pm about 1 km off shore. Second group closer (est about half a km and appeared to be feeding or playing. Third grouping was within 100 metres of shore. At least two groups appeared to have young individuals with them. All appeared to be heading in the same direction. Continued to watch another 5 to 10 individuals singly, or in pairs or triplets follow the other groups. Appeared to be at least 3 males. They appeared to be traveling in a large spread out group. At least one group appeared to be feeding as they doubled back more than once. - Don Knox

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:25 am - </b>a small, single whale out front. Don't know what species. Looks like a smallish orca. It is NOT a minke, grey, humpback. Went south down <b>Eld Inlet at 9:30</b> to Flap Jack Point and then turned around at 10:00 and has now headed out north to Squaxin Island area. Flat calm. Could hear the blows, see the dorsal fin, and then the lingering footprint on the water. - Kim Merriman

Late afternoon I came across the <b>T049A's and T049B's</b> westbound off of<b> Otter Point</b>. They led us to a large group of <b>California T's (CA's), including CA166, CA172, and CA173</b>. They were mixed with T038A and other known T's who were eastbound near <b>Sheringham Point lighthouse</b>. The T049A's and T049B's turned around within a few metres of them and then led the entire group back to the east where we left them offshore of Sooke at 1700 hrs. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

At <b>Point No Point a single humpback</b> was feeding just off shore from <b>5:00pm to 6:20 pm</b> tonight, and was still feeding when I left. It was going back and forth having quite the meal from the east side of the light house to the north shore. - Dianne Dee Iverson

<b>4 pm - From Bush Point, two humpbacks</b> still there, somewhere out in the middle of the Possession Triangle, between Kingston and maybe Shoreline, now maybe a or two mile apart.
<br/><b>3:35 pm - </b>just saw <b>another spout</b>! Getting VERY hazy, but the spout is still in the area near where they were first seen - from here (south of Bush Pt, Whidbey Isl) they are <b>just south of the group of cell towers above Edmonds</b>, south of the Edmonds ferry.
<br/><b>2:09 - two more spouts</b> seen. From here (Whidbey) on the top of the hill behind the whales are a bunch of big cell towers - not sure if that would line up for you Connie but it might give you the general direction to look.
<br/><b>2:04 pm -</b> just saw a few more spouts and sun glinting off the whales. There have to be at least two, saw<b> two spouts</b> in different places but timed close together. They may be a bit further south than the first sighting.
<br/>WHALE SIGHTING!!! Just now (<b>1:15 pm</b>) are seeing spouts and what looks like whales diving in the area between Edmonds, Pt No Point &amp; Possession Point! Too far to tell for sure, but the spouts look huge (thinking humpback?) but there were at least 2 as we saw several spouts in a short time. The distance might be making the spouts look bigger than they are. - Susan Berta

Humpbacks everywhere today! <b>5 Humpback whales, 10+ killer whales</b>, sea lions, seals, Dalls porpoise, <b>Pacific white sided dolphins</b> and huge bait balls getting picked off diving birds. The highlight was "Big Momma" and her calf going crazy in the Strait of Georgia. Double breaches and pec slaps and much more. They were really mellow and then all of a sudden.....double breaches, double pec slaps, throat slaps, tail slaps......MADNESS! It was so awesome. J pod kicking around too with some Lags. What a day full of wildlife! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Saw <b>a single Humpback whale off Point No Point</b> on Wednesday  between noon and <b>3 pm</b>. Was headed north when we left, but had been swimming around the area with no particular direction.

(There were some K pod animals around, but I didn't get to see them) This was the first time I've seen Pacific White-sided Dolphins bowride and harass a Killer Whale! - Traci Walter

Two-year-old little <b>J49</b> goes tearing off after <b>a few Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> (also known as lags). These little dolphins know they aren't in any danger flitting around with the resident orcas simply because resident orcas limit their diet to mainly salmon. However the orcas always seem to have an air of extreme annoyance about them whenever lags are around. The lags like to hum around the orcas and it must like having an obnoxious little mosquito buzzing tirelessly in your ear. There are many cases in the past few weeks where I have seen orcas do blatantly long dives to keep away from these little menacing creatures. Or they have exhibited over-zealous tail slaps. At times they almost seem to say, "THAT'S IT!!!" and go flying off chasing the little dolphins like J49 is doing here. Or perhaps he just found some playmates that are as busy as he is. I just find it interesting how much the orcas seem to have no patience for these critters when we as humans would happily play with them for hours. The difference between species... - Katie Jones
