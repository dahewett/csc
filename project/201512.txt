Last night (December 31st) we sat out by the water in the darkness <b>Roberts Creek BC </b>listening to the Seal Lions on White Islet being very vocal. We started hearing a strange noise coming closer and then we realized it was <b>3 or 4 whales spouting</b>. They swam by and kept going down towards Gibsons/ Vancouver. We were under the impression that the whales had migrated from this area for the season? Do they usually stick around the southern Georgia Strait in the winter? This is our first winter out here and we were very excited and surprised! It sounded to me like orcas from what I've experienced before but I can't really say for sure. The breathing was quick and intense and they seemed to be swimming close together. They were always swimming fairly quick it seemed. Unfortunately we couldn't see them at all bit it was still pretty magical. -Brandi Fitzpatrick 
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon - Orca activity off Driftwood Beach, Oregon</b>: I saw<b> a large # of almost simultaneous blows</b> in a fairly tight group about <b>3-4 m off shore</b>. We are at about 250' elevation. About 10min or so later I saw them again further out and again later on even further, maybe 10mile? I could not make out what prey they were after as my 10x binocs did not allow detail, but I did see reflections off the backs of some. It was amazing. -Garry Helms

Still heading north - so wonderful to have them still hanging around! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:45 p.m. - </b>Seeing <b>two humpbacks</b>, blows and arched backs, probably east of Eglon, moving east. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/>

Watched <b>2 humpbacks from 1:00-2:15pm from Eglon</b>. They were toward the other side of the channel. -Becky Newell Woodworth

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:12 a.m. -</b> after a quick look - I did find a couple (<b>humpbacks</b>) again on <b>Kitsap side south Eglon</b> (just south now of large green lawn near the water). <b>At least two, maybe three?!</b> -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

About <b>12:15 p.m. - </b>We were boating in <b>Drayton Passage</b> when <b>a whale</b> breached about 20 feet from our boat. It was<b> either a small fin whale or a minke</b> whale. Drayton passage is in the south sound by McNeil Island. Thanks. -Beth Vandehey

<b>4:00 p.m. - One small orca</b> traveling very close to shore. The orca was seen by itself in <b>Malaspina Strait about 5 miles south of Powell River</b>. I spotted it from shore and watched it for about 5 minutes. I would say it was not a calf. Guessing it was about 12 feet long and it's dorsal fin to be about 12 inches tall. I saw no other white markings on it's body when it came up for air. It was in traveling mode for sure and looked to be in no distress. -Dan Robinson

Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 102...Jane Cogan and Jeanne Hyde called Dave at home to relay a report of<b> killer whales being spotted in San Juan Channel</b>. Dave headed over to CWR and then to Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 0940...Orca finally arrived on scene at 1250 about <b>a mile southwest of the Salmon Bank</b> buoy. Morning Star, who had stayed with the whales and helped Orca get there, reported that all the whales had been together in one group and had recently split up into several groups as they headed slowly southwest. The groups were spread out north to south with the largest group including the <b>J11's, J14's, J19's, J22's, and the J35's. J2 and L87 and the rest of the J17's had disappeared to the south</b> somewhere while the <b>J16's were somewhere to the northwest</b>....

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<br/><b>11:19 a.m. - checked again just now, blows still in same general area</b>.
<br/><b>8:34 a.m. - definitely humpbacks, at least three maybe four?</b> Just saw a fluke on a dive. Must be in a feeding pattern as now they are slightly more north than last viewing.
<br/><b>8:26 a.m. - group slowly moving south</b> - behavior appears to be more like humpbacks with large surface blows then dives of several minutes. *viewing from North Edmonds
<br<b>&gt;8:14 a.m. - many blows from several whales in the Rose Point area (south of Elgon north of Kingston) near Kitsap side</br<b>. I'm guessing humpbacks (again, several at least), but  frequency of blows looks more like Orcas. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/>

(Below is an excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter 101 Report confirming the new calf designated J54)
<br/>....Jeanne pointed Dave in the right direction to<b> J28 and the calf </b>and he found them with little problem at<b> 1110 off Smallpox Bay. J28, her new calf J54, and J46</b> traveled as a threesome for the rest of the encounter. They were surfacing erratically and taking long dives so obtaining good photographs was difficult to say the least. The calf appeared to be in good health and not once during the long dives did J54 surface early before the other two like young calves often will. The J28's moved out to mid-strait while in front of Andrews Bay but moved back inshore by the time they made it to Kellett Bluff....

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:45 p.m. - </b>I have been viewing from Alki point. Saw them <b>north off Blake Island</b> and one small group to the left of the yellow buoy heading north.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just heard from WA State Ferries that a pod of about <b>7 - 10 orcas</b> was sighted off the <b>Fauntleroy ferry dock at 1 pm</b> heading south; then at about <b>1:30</b> they headed north. We talked to the Monitors at the Vashon ferry dock construction site and they had already paused their operations.
<br/>(All December 15th sightings reports are unconfirmed as to which type, seems likely J pod continued south and stayed overnight -ALB)

When I first spotted <b>J pod at Ebey's Landing</b>, they were pushing SW away from me, so I made the decision to hop the ferry over to Port Townsend. As soon <b>as I arrived to Fort Worden, I spotted whales just a 100 yards offshore or so. J27</b> was a little further out traveling with little brother <b>J39</b>. The group closer to me included <b>J51</b>. Time constraints forced me to take the 12:30 ferry home. As slow as the whales were moving, I was hopeful I might see them on the ferry. Halfway through the ride, still hadn't spotted a thing. Then, dead ahead was <b>J34</b> traveling with his mom <b>J22</b>. After they passed by, I figured that was it. Then, a group with a small calf (<b>J17s</b>) popped up right next to the ferry and the captain cut the engines. It appeared a couple of the whales corralled and maneuvered the baby away from the ferry. This happened as the whales entered the sun glare and I wasn't able to get the best pictures. But, one of my last sights as the whales were behind us, was seeing <b>J28</b> traveling with an itty bitty fin presumably <b>J54</b>, my first time seeing him/her! All in all, it was a much needed day spent in some much needed sunshine with many J pod whales. And HUGE thanks to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for helping me sort out IDs! 
<br/><b>1:11 p.m. - </b>They're definitely spread out and the groups I was watching at <b>Ft Worden</b> were actually the trailers. Spotted other blows much further south of ferry lanes while we had a group right next to the ferry, and they looked like the whales I had been watching at Ft Worden. Definitely over a dozen.
<br/><b>1:02 p.m. - </b>They just crossed the <b>Port Townsend ferry lanes</b>. A group with a baby popped up right next to the ferry!
<br/><b>11:46 a.m. - </b>They are currently going very slowly. I have to catch the 1230 ferry back, I'll be watching for them on there too. But at this rate they may not make Point No Point before dark, but they could pick up the pace, who knows!
<br/><b>11:36 a.m. - </b>They just came up off <b>Fort Worden</b>. Slowly southbound. Positive ID on <b>J27</b>. One group is on Jefferson County side, I saw some further out mid channel.
<br/><b>9:55 a.m. - </b> they had pushed more west of me but were still south bound. They were <b>north of Pt. Wilson</b>. My only shot at a better view is to get lucky on the ferry, will update again in a bit.
<br/><b>9:30 a.m. - </b>just spotted them thanks to the Clipper.<b> North of Ebeys landing</b> still southbound. -Rachel Haight

Ivan called Dave at home in the AM to say he had whales in<b> San Juan Channel </b>headed toward Spieden Channel. Dave and Giles headed to Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 0930. Ivan stayed with the whales until Orca arrived on scene at<b> 0944 a couple hundred yards south of Battleship Rock</b>. Ken and Heather came out in Chimo a little later. The whales were in three groups heading south with the<b> K13's trailing the J14's, J2, and L87</b> by about a hundred yards. The <b>J16's and J19's were a couple hundred yards offshore </b>of the others in a loose group. <b>J39</b> was traveling with the J16's and J19's but we did not see any others of the J11's, J17's, or J22's....

<b>December 1 &amp; 2 Noon - We saw orcas at Falcon Cove Beach, Clatsop County, Oregon</b>. First time, Dec 1: large rafts of sea lions jugging (floating with flippers in the air) just beyond the breakers, perhaps 50 sea lions. Suddenly, they started porpoising, surfing the waves, and moving fast. For a short moment, we thought they were playing, but then saw 2 small spouts among them -- whales! Sea lions kept scattering, many coming into the breakers closer to shore. By then, we guessed killer whales though we've never seen them here before. Never saw any dorsal fins. Watched the action for +- 10 minutes. Finally they all moved north of the bird rocks and we lost our view.
The next day, Dec 2, we were watching the rafts of sea lions again. This time we saw the dorsal fins and spouts as sea lions dashed in all directions. Had them in sight for about 5 minutes. The orcas moved south. We saw 2 females for sure (side by side, curved fins) and 2 small spouts farther out which we assumed were also orcas. Grays have been moving through but their spouts are bigger. -Viviane Simon-Brown
