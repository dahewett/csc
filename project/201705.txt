We haven't seen <b>J Pod</b> much this spring so it was extra special having them <b>rolling around in Open Bay this afternoon</b>. This is <b>J31</b> Tsuchi doing her flying lessons. Tsuchi is a 22-year-old female and her siblings are J27 Blackberry and J39 Mako. -Photo by Katie Jones

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Jpod came down the west side very early this morning</b> and it looked like they were going to head west. Turns out they decided to come back in and spent a good portion of the day tucked into Open Bay on the Northwest side of San Juan Island, seemingly waiting out the strong ebb current that was happening. Lots of socializing going on with some spyhops, and then they woke up and started breaching and tail slapping. We saw so many different orca behaviors it was amazing! What a fantastic encounter with <b>Jpod</b>! This family group <b>tucked into a place called Open Bay / Kellett Bluff </b>to seemingly ride out the strong ebb tide that would have carried them south. They were moving rather slowly as they socialized. Rolling on top of one another, sticking noses out of the water. Even vocalizing above the surface! They were also playing with bits of kelp too. A couple times they tried to go around the bluff and head north, but it seemed like the current was not to their liking, so they would tuck back into the bay. Once the tide flipped, they continued on north. Watch til the very end! They get a little more active at the end of the encounter with a couple breaches and surfing too!

<b>J Pod</b> enjoying themselves. They were very active. There were many breaches. Magnificent creatures! This was <b>mid afternoon</b>.

<b>L87, J27 and J16's - Jpod</b> as they made their way in to the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> today and then went north. -Photo by Renee Beitzel, May 31, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>J16, J50, J42 - J Pod</b> southern resident (fish eating) orca on Monday...We had the 16's with Blackberry in close and the 22's with J19 and L87 a bit further out. -Photo by James Gresham, May 31, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

They decided to stay! After coming back down from up north early this morning (this shot (below) of <b>J17 Princess Angeline</b> was taken <b>before 7 AM</b>!),<b> J-Pod</b> looked like they were going to go west, but then looped back and went north again. This is more the type of travel pattern we expect from them in the summer, so hopefully they continue to be around on a more regular basis from here on out! -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Good morning, <b>J-pod</b> (and nice to see you too, Tahlequah!). What a lovely detour on the way to town this morning. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu, May 31, 2017

Possession Sound - Just saw a pod of <b>6 - 7 orcas at 5:29 pm, heading north from Howarth Park in Everett</b>. Going towards navy yard. Awesome action. Sorry but I couldn't get phone out in time. Traveling. Creating water as they went. Multiple times. Appears to be following coastline. -Bryan Hoeck

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Humpback</b> on 5.31.17 @ <b>1130</b> heading north. Now at <b>Southworth ferry lane</b>. Wish I had a real camera, could have shot the breach at the SW point, but mile up and out of my usable photo range. Still a pleasure, but got these  shots.  -Tim Ferris

The whales were traveling south fairly quickly and spread out in three or four tight groups. <b>T77A and T87</b> were traveling together about a half mile to the northwest of the <b>T86As, T124Ds, and T124A1. The rest of the T124As and the T100s (minus the T100Bs who were not present) were a little further to the southeast of this group</b>...-See full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 39

After Jane Cogan called Dave at home in the early evening to report that she was hearing <b>J pod calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>, Dave, Giles, and Collette met down at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at about 1930. We arrived on scene off the <b>south end of Kellett Bluff at 1938. J pod and L87 were in a resting formation</b> with all the whales being in one tight group moving very slowly north with the tide. We left the whales heading north up Haro Strait off north Kellett Bluff at 2008 still in one tight slow moving group. All members of J pod and L87 were photographed. See full report details and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 38.

Ask and ye shall receive - our patience was rewarded this evening when <b>all of J-Pod</b> returned for a beautiful sunset encounter. It was pretty special to see them traveling all together in one tight group! We left all of J Pod heading north in one group <b>1 mile south of Turn Pt at 20:45</b>. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, May 28, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Early evening off San Juan Island in Haro Strait: Jpod</b> just blew on past! Major flood going on and that clearly gave them quite the push! Hopefully, there are salmon here. I have to keep up the hope. -Photo by Traci Walter

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Some Rough Seas and Thick Fog to start our adventure today...around the <b>Victoria Water Front there was reports of Transient Killer Whales</b> in the area...After a visit with them he headed back to Sooke through some pea soup fog when a young guest noticed a few orca.  The last two pictures were captured by Sheila Watson Mansell

We followed <b>4-6 Orcas this evening into BC waters</b>...for about an hour as we had captured site of a whale watching boat leaving rapidly up north from Roche Harbor. I believe we caught up with them by <b>Salt Spring Island</b>. Not familiar with the area but this is the lighthouse they seemed to come back together by then proceeded north around <b>7:30pm</b>. -Jess Whitsett

A fresh breeze, brilliant sunshine, blue seas and skies greeted passengers and crew of Mystic Sea as we headed through the islands towards Canada to spend time with transient orcas. The <b>T101s and T102</b> were traveling in leisurely fashion off <b>Cordova Bay, near Victoria, B.C</b>., initially fairly well spread out before grouping up with no apparent lunch stops along the way. Once again another day of wonderful wildlife and scenery was enjoyed by all. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<b>Juan de Fuca Strait - Humpbacks</b> in Canadian waters today... With clear and calm sailing conditions, it was well worth the long haul to <b>Constance Bank, British Columbia, where we encountered heroic humpback whale MMY0009</b> trending west against the breathtaking vista of the snow-capped Olympic peninsula. This whale was one of the humpbacks involved in saving a Steller sea lion from the attacking T100 transient orca pod last year. After their intervention, which resulted in the orcas abandoning dinner, the humpbacks escorted the sea-lion away from the scene. Not such a good day for the transients! Shortly after leaving MMY0009 and heading south, another of our favorite humpbacks, believed to be Poptart (sixth calf of Big Mama), kept us company for a while before we headed home after yet another invigorating and memorable cruise. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<b>Case Inlet - 4:00 p.m. - Minke Whale sighting North Pickering Passage, off Harstine Island</b>. It was a lone Minke, surfacing frequently, traveling in a meandering route first south through Pickering, then turning north and passing close to Dougall Point before heading east to Case Inlet. Once in Case Inlet, it took a series of much longer dives, apparently feeding. I'm pretty confident this was a Minke. I was in my kayak and had a pretty close look at it. It was not a terribly large whale (a bit bigger than on Orca), black or dark grey. When it surfaced, it exposed just the arc of its back, showing a small dorsal fin about 2/3 towards its rear. It never  breached entirely or exposed its tail.when it dove. The whale tended to surface several times in fairly rapid succession, then would dive for longer periods. We've seen this whale (or another one like it) around here off and on since late April. I  hope that helps. -Paul Murphy 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 
 
This morning. No whales....YET! But there have to be <b>at least 2 dozen harbor porpoise</b> in various areas of the bay. Some are feeding. Some are simply traveling from place to place. All of that on glassy water so they look so much larger than the are. And it's so silent, you can hear them not only breathe, but some make a sort of 'squeak' when they surface. -Photo by Kim Merriman

I spoke with my friend who also witnessed the <b>Orcas</b> at Harris Beach State Park in Brookings Oregon and had binoculars on them for longer than I did.

We suspect it was a mother and her baby since the one Orca was huge and the other was relatively small. They couldn't have been more than 150 yards from the beach.) -Steve Thompson

Sometimes, rarely - the curiosity is mutual. After paralleling the <b>T123s</b> for half an hour, they surfaced after an 8 minute dive right behind us.

This is a family group known as the <b>T123's</b> which consists of a <b>32-Year-old Mother (Sidney) and her two kids, T123A a 17-year-old male (Stanley), and T123C her 5-year-old daughter(Lucky)</b>. They were traveling along when suddenly everything changed when they pursued a large Steller Sea lion. This is the video from that scene. Lots of aerial action today. In the video, you can sometimes see the sea lion. It did not appear that they finished or ate the sea lion and after the attack, they quickly moved out of the area.  All three family members got involved in the hunt, but you will notice the 5-year-old gets in there quite a bit at the end. It's always amazing to see how young these animals in to learn the skills to survive. Please note this video was taken with a 600mm lens while abiding by whale watching regulations that can be found at bewhalewise.org. -Traci Walter, Western Prince WW

After receiving reports of the <b>T123 family of transient killer whales heading down President's Channel</b>, we departed Friday Harbor to meet up with them. When we arrived they were milling for a brief moment before changing course directly towards<b> Green Pt, Spieden Island</b>, where the steller sea lions hang out. Suddenly exploding through the water was T123 charging after a sea lion. The hunt was on as she and her 2 offspring lunged and leapt after it. We think he was one lucky sea lion who escaped close to shore after a dramatic encounter. -Barbar Bender Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Mothering Sunday with <b>humpback whale Big Mama</b>! Not only was Big Mama (<b>BCY0324) present off East Point, Saturna Island</b>, B.C., but also one of her calves,<b> Split Fin (BCZ0298)</b> born in 2006, together with companion Divot (BCX1057). All three whales were in a steady traveling pattern, undisturbed by the growling and groaning of the many Steller sea-lions swimming or hauled out on the rocks nearby. Calm conditions enabled passengers to view local marine life at its best, and witness first-hand Big Mama's explosive exhalations. As the saying goes, "Thar she blows." -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<b>7:40 p.m. - </b>Tonight while riding the Amtrak Cascades northbound, I was treated to a glimpse of <b>a lone male orca between Mukilteo and Everett,</b>. Seems like it was about the same time and place as the Bigg's/Transients that were spotted on Monday evening. He surfaced twice and then I lost him. What a treat! -Jennifer Tennessen

By <b>7:00 pm they had made the turn heading southbound towards Mukilteo</b> with a gorgeous rain squall moving in from the south. 
<br/><b>6:45 p.m. - one boy in lead hugging closer to Hat/Gedney</b> still southeast bound approaching east end of island. Mom is a little more towards mid about 3 minutes behind and other two boys are on Priest Point side of mid channel about 1-2 minutes behind her. All southeast bound steady pace.
<br/><b>6:15 p.m. - they passed between Tulalip Bay</b> and northside of Hat/Gedney steady pace southeast bound towards Priest Point and Everett. 
<br/><b>5:44 p.m. - 1 male just exiting Port Susan</b>. Southbound mid channel at Camano Head; 
<br/><b>5:53 p.m. - female now exiting passing southbound </b>a bit further west at green channel marker at Camano Head; 
<br/><b>5:55 p.m. - 2nd male  now passing southbound Camano head</b>; 
<br/><b>5:57 p.m. - 3rd male now passing the channel marker off Camano Head</b> more east of mid channel
<br/>4:45 p.m. -  they are south of Kayak Point (to the east) and Sunny Shore Acres (on Camano), together but loosely spread powering southbound in the chop. It's so cold out here! I male in the lead, followed by mom and one son, 3rd male is trailing. 
<br/>4:25 p.m. - I watched them continue north for about 30 minutes then lost them until now. Thinking they went deep north and maybe west into Port Susan and disappeared on me for about the past hour... they are now southbound about where I last saw them out in middle of the port, mid channel.
<br/>2:45 p.m. - on a hunch (in part based on a report they were in here yesterday...) I ventured to Kayak Point Park, Port Susan. I arrived to fairly choppy seas and somehow see big boys dorsals (presuming <b>T101s</b>) in the middle out from my location kind of milling at first trending north at the moment! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>11:30 a.m. - </b>We spotted <b>two female Orcas (one could have possibly been a calf) near the Mukilteo ferry</b>. We viewed them from the beach, they came up for air several times then disappeared from sight. The Orca were relatively close to the beach if I were to guess I would saw about 200-300 feet (this distance could be totally wrong). It was low tide at the time of sighting, roughly 11:30 am. Traveling. The two were heading south. -Zoe Denckla

Sidney, BC - <b>1PM Trip</b> with Captain Gary: Whales right on our doorstep! We enjoyed a beautiful afternoon with the <b>T018's, a family of four Biggs killer whales</b>. We saw them have two successful hunts and had a big syphon from this huge boy, <b>T019B </b>"Galiano". -Ocean Eco-Ventures WW, <b>Cowichan Bay</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:30 a.m. - Orcas off Sidney, BC</b> I saw <b>at least 4 orcas</b> (a male and 3 smaller dorsal fins). They were heading North and clearly visible from land. I watched them for about 5 minutes from inside the Ocean Discovery Centre. They were visible only by their fins, no jumps. The orcas in the pod seemed to come up and breathe all at the same time, or very close to the same time. From time to time, they would dissapear for about 45 seconds to 1 minute and then were up again. They appeared to be feeding on seals or Sea Lions for there was water movement, turmoil about 2-3 meters in front of them (the sea was calm). (<b>T18s</b>, see above report by Ocean Eco-Ventures), -Nathanael Lisimaque

Unidentified whales - Harley and I disagree about what but we saw a cetacean about 10-15 minutes ago (<b>3:20-3:25</b>). I saw the blow and saw one orca come up. Out of the water-totally unexpected! We turned engine off man hour ago and have been drifting with current and just main up. Wow! Got my adrenaline going! We've been watching but haven't seen anything since. Harley thinks it was a humpback but he didn't see as much as I did...where we are-<b>south of Possession Point </b>midchannel. Both sails up now and we are heading back north. -Sharon Ann Clark

On the <b>3:00 crossing from Mukilteo </b>- soon after M/V Kittitas was under way several people exclaimed "whale!" I, of course, was scanning the opposite side of the vessel. I spoke with a young man who distinctly described the fluking of a baleen whale. He did not see the back. Location was <b>just north of ferry lanes</b>. Possession is glassy and it's beautiful out there so anyone on this crossing the remainder of the day should be on the sun deck! -Debbie Stewart

<b>Female and calf. </b>The surf was rolling in heavy while I was kayaking and something caught the corner of my eye. I thought it must've been a black seabird of some sort diving or a harbor porpoise because I couldn't quite see over the waves. I gave up kayaking about 10 seconds later. And once I hauled my kayak up on shore I turned and mom and calf were straight out from where I just was. Realized mama's fin caught my eye then I glanced and must've seen the little one going under. -Photo by Ariel Yseth, May 9, 2017

By <b>1:00 p.m. -</b> it was clear they were on to something as several were <b>porpoising at high speed directly towards Richmond Beach</b> Saltwater Park. I got down to the Beach and at approximately <b>1:15pm</b>, rounded the overpass to see flying bodies and churning water 100 yards or so off shore! The tired and injured Sea lion swam along the shore...At some point the <b>T101s</b> joined from the west and at 1:55 the earlier most northern pod joined as well. (see video below) -Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>Here is a 8.5 minute video starting just after the first contact and ending with them taking the Sea Lion. WARNING: there is no blood or gore but there is closeup footage of the sea lion getting taken under just feet from shore around the 7 minute mark which might be upsetting to some. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network, May 8, 2017 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

At <b>12:45 p.m</b>. I moved to Richmond Beach Saltwater park and watched them move south. <b>Seem to have no interest in the gray whale. T101s are on the west side channel</b> and trailing a bit north behind the others. 
<br/>Approx 12:35 p.m. - The <b>two lead groups joined up are are just resting</b>, convening? mid channel now east of the yellow mid channel buoy between Richmond Beach and President Point. I am in contact with Puget Sound Express/Chilkat who has come upon a small emaciated gray whale who is just 1/4 mile ahead. They are taking photos and keeping track of the whale so that the stranding networks can be alerted. We all of course are wondering if there will be a predation on this whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

The predation event took place in-shore off Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline by several pods. Reports and documentation of the encounter were included in our May 8th Whale Sighting Report Part Two: Bigg's, including a sequence of Tom's photos of <b>T68B</b> who has the sea lion in her mouth. ID notes from these photos and other sent to Dave Ellifrit at Center for Whale Research: "In addition to the <b>T101s</b>, the only whale I can confirm (I'm still waiting for my first T68Bs encounter) is that <b>T124A1</b> is also in there."

"Ken called <b>in the morning reporting that whales were heading east off Sooke</b>. After waiting for the whales to get a little closer, Giles and Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left at 1145. We found <b>our first whales about a half mile east of Trial Island at 1225. This was J35 along with J47 and J45. J17, J44, and J53 </b>were a little behind the others and quickly caught up and the whales all traveled east in a loose group before turning north once they past Seabird Point. There were <b>other whales well on their way across Haro Strait heading toward the west side of San Juan Island</b> so we moved ahead and briefly saw <b>J40 and J27 spread out heading northeast toward False Bay</b>. Since the leaders had already hit the west side, we decided to move up toward Bellevue Point and let the leaders come to us..."

<b>J53 "Kiki" showing off some aerials in Boundary Pass!</b> One of those incredible nights. Flat calm, beautiful light and not another boat in sight. We shut down and you could hear a pin drop, it was so quiet. We could hear breaches but couldn't see some of the animals because of the huge spread and then J53 started doing this! We had a pretty epic time with <b>J47</b> too. -Gary Sutton, May 7, 2017

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We saw members of all matrilines and almost every whale, though some were offshore and unidentifiable. We left them at <b>16:30 at Turn Point</b> undecided between Swanson and Boundary. Really spread out at the beginning but some closer more playful groups near the end. Really cool to see <b>L87, J38, J45, and J49</b> all hanging out together playing. <b>J19</b> was in the lead being very J2-like, for today anyway. All the youngster were very bouncy and looked healthy, to me anyway! -Monika Wieland Shields

Good day, I live in Old Town Mukilteo. I have a view of Hat Island, and Possession Sound. On Sunday about<b> 3:00 p.m.</b> I spotted (through binoculars) <b>2, possibly 3 whales,</b> "cruising," with/next to a south-bound sailboat <b>about a mile south of the eastern tip of Hat</b>. I also own a sailboat, and have had close encounters with Grays in Possession Sound and as such, that is what I was watching for, however the dorsal fins on these whales where, "unmistakably," Orcas...  long, tall, "black," dorsals....  I am by no means an expert, but I'm pretty sure it was a pod of Orcas.  I have no idea which one. It would be awesome if someone else also reported this sighting...-Patrick R Greer

For the past half hour I have been watching the<b> Pod of Orca's that exited Colvos Passage, near the southend of Blake Island</b>, further east @ 500 yards ...they were hunting, look like 2 big boys as they kept turning directions, ... lots of activity , tail slapping, breaching, thrashing and splashing as they made a kill...I watch them hunt and then catch their prey.. saw lots of activity and Seabirds flying overhead.

Us south Sounders sure got a treat today. My wife and I were at the end of the beach bridge at <b>Chambers Bay</b> with binoculars when the orca appeared. We (well they through our excitement) drew quite a crowd. Then we drive up to Pt Defiance and stopped at one of the overlooks by the Narrows Bridge (which is where I figured they were going). Not only the group we saw at Chambers but a few more. Been doing random whale searches for years and this was our first orca success. Seen porpoises humpbacks and grays but our first for our favorites. Blessed. -Jamie Taylor

<br/><b>3:14 p.m. - new group 5-6 orcas came up around west side of Anderson island</b>. Between McNeil and Anderson now, closer to ferry dock on AI and headed north. Boats with them.

<b>Bigg's/Transients May 1-4 - </b>What a lovely evening...in between some of the most glorious hours of stormy weather, to hear and see this super pod. I saw a seal very close to shore once the thunder and lightning and rain had moved north.  Wondered why.  It wasn't 3 minutes later when the calm turned to a chorus of blows punctuated with rows of whales moving with a purpose into <b>Eld Inlet</b>....It was the most FABULOUS storm. EVER. I loved all 6+ hours of it. After the orca left during the break in such wildness, the storm started all over again. It seemed totally magical that they showed up in this carved off hour of magic...Here are a few other images as they were heading north out of Eld. There were so many of them it was hard to tell where to shoot. These are all from my beach. The only sounds were of a few way off squeals and the 'Oh My God" from others.  Then the beginning sounds of water and breath breaking the surface before it blasted through the silence with such force and stuttered fashion.  Each whale bursting forth.  So incredible.  After the swam off into the misty fog bank, we were greeted by failing light and another round of fireworks in the sky. But they were off traveling somewhere into northern water. -Kim Merriman (see photos below)

<b>Approx 11:45 a.m. - I was out on a boat there were about 30 heading south on the east side of Anderson island</b>... they were everywhere it was amazing. It looked they split into a couple groups right after Anderson island (pin drop shows split at south end Harstine) I was shocked to see how many there were it was beautiful. They had at least 2 babies in their pod...I'm pretty positive I saw jigsaw super long jagged dorsal fin (probably T86A3) ...  When they split the group that went left had a baby, two HUGE males, and a couple females all close together. The other group also had a baby maybe two, and more females than males. They started gravitating closer to shore by Anderson island. I didn't see which way the one that looked like jigsaw went. They were moving pretty quickly. -Jami Cantrell

We just saw the orca pod of<b> at least eight maybe up to 10 orcas midchannel southbound through the Narrows</b>. We saw them 1/2 mile north of the Narrows Bridge at<b> 8:15 AM</b>.  The whale at the head of the pod was huge, assuming a male but any other detail was impossible to see from my house. They were making good time. There was a nice variety in size and this time, no harassing boaters! -Susan Dynes

May 1 -<b> Juan de Fuca </b>- It was a long haul but in the end it paid off with <b>a humpback whale and the T46Bs south of Sheringham</b>.
