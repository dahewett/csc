Recapping the visit by K pod into Sinclair Inet, Susan Marie Andersson writes:
<br/>
What a thrill to have <b>K pod</b> in our local waters for the afternoon. I'm pretty excited by the fans/eager learners we are starting to see line up on our shores when the whales are near. The car line up on Beach drive in Port Orchard went on and on for what seemed like miles.
<br/>
I heard that orcas had been spotted off Vashon near the<b> Tahlequah ferry terminal</b> and were <b>headed north up Colvos Passage</b>. A slight detour had me at Manchester park and then Manchester pier around noon after Connie relayed Kelly's report of the orcas "hanging out around an anchored freighter. While looking from the pier, I met the wife of an orca fan who's husband saw them <b>near the Southworth Ferry dock</b>. We waited together for almost 30 min. before members of the whales appeared from behind one of the three gigantic freighters parked off Blake Island. Due to the longshoreman's strike the area north, west and south of Blake Island has been the holding spot for numerous freighters for months now. I'm wondering if these giant ships threw the whales off? It was weird behavior from the get go.
<br/>
At some point Brad Hansen and the NOAA Zodiak appeared. The ships blocked a lot, and I'm wondering if NOAA attempted a tag in this time frame? Anyway, there was a lot of milling and direction changing by K pod, (pretty sure at that point who we were seeing) but no real foraging behavior that I could tell. K Pod and NOAA started to head toward Restoration Point off the south end of Bainbridge and I turned to leave.
<br/>
Before reaching my car, which was at a higher vantage point, I saw that <b>K Pod had done a 180 and was headed rapidly back toward Manchester and Rich Passage</b>. It was foggy, and visibility poor, and those damn freighters were like high rise buildings on their sides.
<br/>
I was still able to stick with them most of the afternoon by following the shoreline from Manchester to Port Orchard. Port Orchard roads are narrow, there are few view point but tons of traffic. I was able to stick with <b>K pod all the way into the Bremerton Navy shipyard</b> where they hesitated. Up to that point they had stayed pretty close together the entire way up from Blake Island. As they reached downtown Bremerton they spread out, and did a lot of back and forth movement, almost like pacing...
<br/>
At this point word was out and the narrow road along the beach was clogged with traffic. There must have been close to a hundred people or more lined along the shore. It reminded me of a classic summer bear jam in Yellowstone! We all watched from shore as a large male, K25, went over to the Manette Bridge. You could hear an audible gasp from the multitudes of onlookers now lined up along the shore here and there in both directions as far as the eye could see. Many were remembering when L Pod got stuck in Dyes Inlet for 30 days in 1997 and you could hear lots of stories being exchanged. After what looked like a close approach to us on shore, he turned and joined the rest of the pod that were now heading back out and east. Phew, what an adventure!

Just got home after spending a beautiful sunset watching a pod of<b> 6-7 orcas</b> spyhopping, tail slapping and cruising slowly North past <b>Ilahee State Park (Bremerton)</b> -- this was between <b>5 and 5:40 pm</b>. Large male in main group and one possibly two orcas trailing the main group by 1/4 mile or so. Was still hearing blows and tail slaps in the dark and sadly had to leave before the park ranger locked me in. I headed to Illahee on a hunch after hearing they were seen in Sinclair Inlet from Bachmann Park (I arrived just as they disappeared around the point with the NOAA Boat). What a treat. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

<b>3:26pm - </b>The more northern group was headed north followed by what looked like a research boat and the southern one, right by the ferry terminal, came from the north and was milling around when we passed on the ferry. It looked like they may have been feeding.
<br/><b>3:16pm -</b> <b>Two groups of about 5 and 4 </b>just outside of the <b>Bremerton ferry terminal</b>. Weren't close enough to get a good picture or ID on them. What a beautiful day for a sighting though! -Lisa Neyman

Late afternoon/dusk, a group of around <b>8 Orcas swam south between the west side of Saltspring Island</b> and the east coast of Vancouver Island.

I work as Quartermaster on the <b>Bainbridge Island/Seattle Washington State Ferry</b>. This afternoon, on our east-bound <b>1405 departure from Bainbridge to Seattle</b> we spotted <b>a breaching calf</b>. This was directly east of Eagle Harbor, directly on the eastern edge of the north-bound ship traffic lane (roughly centered between West Point and Alki). I initially spotted the calf about 2 miles directly east of our position. We reduced all power and came to a stop (on the east edge of the northbound shipping lane). <b>The calf continued toward us until it came within about 200'-300' </b>of our bow (breaching all the way!), then turned south (towards Alki). No adult whales were present, which is fairly disheartening (as is the fact that a very young calf is in Puget Sound this time of year). We had no further sightings of the calf for the remainder of our watch. The calf was approximately 15', a long narrowing head (not bulbous like a gray), a swept back dorsal fin, and long white-ish rough edged pectoral fins. -Gordy Pine

Whale under downtown Seattle at Colman Ferry Dock. GRAY WHALE UPDATE: Today, the necropsy team determined <b>the gray whale found beneath a Seattle dock</b> died from being struck by the propeller of a large vessel. The juvenile female, likely two to three years old and just over 30 feet long, was in very good condition before its death, with thick blubber containing healthy amounts of oil, the examination found. Biologists are not sure why the whale entered Puget Sound since most gray whales have already migrated south along the outer Washington Coast by this time of winter. Large, deep gashes on the whale's right side and back indicated that it was struck by a propeller and likely died quickly, probably within an hour. The time of death was estimated as no earlier than Monday and most likely on Tuesday.

An update from tagged killer whale <b>J27</b>:
After what appeared to be a direct run for Puget Sound by J27 on the last update (19 January), J pod were nowhere to be found in Puget Sound the next day. The mystery was solved when the tag fired up late yesterday (20 January) after its day off duty and showed that the whales had made a 90 degree turn to the right and headed out to the ocean off <b>the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. As of this afternoon they had moved back into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Map courtesy of NMFS' Northwest Fisheries Science Center

<b>3:15 PM - Small single whale in Hood Canal</b> today, spotted near <b>Scenic Beach park in Seabeck</b> headed south.

19 January update - The transmitter on J27 switched to transmitting every other day late in the day of 17 January in order to conserve battery power. Consequently, there were no locations until late in the day on <b>18 January which found the whales west of the Fraser River headed south</b>. They continued south during the night and on the <b>morning of the 19th were heading down San Juan Channel</b>. By that afternoon they were in the middle of the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Juca. -Map provided by NW Fisheries Science Center

I am assuming this is the same animal [a gray whale] we saw at <b>Point Wilson about 2pm</b>. It looked fairly small, but seemed to be traveling well. It hung out in the current around Point Wilson for 30+ min too, so maybe it just likes current? -Chrissy McLean

17 January update - On the previous update (Thursday, 15 January), <b>J27 (and the rest of J pod) were off the northeast corner of Texada Island</b> in the northern Strait of Georgia.

<b>9:18 AM - Single baby or juvenile whale</b> sighting in front of our home this am 200 ft off shore, <b>between Yukon Harbor and Manchester in Port Orchard</b> across from Blake Island. The whale surfaced several times blowing, rolled to side surfacing with fin for at least 15 minutes; we've lived here 10 years, this is first whale sighting. We frequently see seal and sea lion; I am fairly certain what I saw today not either. Seal and seal lion surface frequently near our shoreline however the blowing and rolling behavior does not fit with what we normally observe. I did take pictures with my cell phone but quality is very poor. -Sandy Ringstead

15 January update - Our previous update <b>(Monday, January 12), found J27 (and the rest of J pod) approaching the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. The whales traveled into the open ocean, but only a short distance and for only for a brief time, before almost retracing their track back into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. By the <b>evening of Tuesday, January 13 they were off Victoria</b>, then traveled up Haro Strait, and by the morning of the <b>January 14 they went through Active Pass</b>. By this morning, <b>January 15, they were off the northeast corner of Texada Island </b>in the northern Strait of Georgia. -Map provided by NW Fisheries Science Center

Jeanne Hyde spotted <b>transients from home this morning off Bellevue Pt</b>. somewhere around <b>11am</b> and called Dave. The whales headed north and Tom and Jane Cogan kept them in sight while Dave and Jeanne scrambled for the boat. We got on them <b>off Kellett Bluff</b> and found the <b>T60s and T2B </b>milling. They later made a kill off north Kellett Bluff before heading <b>east into Spieden Channel</b>. Then they went around Sentinel Island, around the west tip of Spieden Island and we left them at <b>1445</b> heading east in New Channel on the <b>north side of Spieden Island</b>. They may have been making another kill as we were leaving the area. Other boats were still with them after we left. -Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research

On the previous update (Thursday, January 8), <b>J27 (and the rest of J pod) were heading south in the northern Strait of Georgia</b>. They <b>made a beeline for Puget Sound</b> arriving in there late Friday afternoon. Using the satellite tag location information we were able to anticipate their location on Saturday morning and readily locate them <b>off Elliot Bay</b> as they moved north. This allowed us to observe <b>J50, who was with J16</b>. We were also able to check the tag attachment on J27, which is holding as designed. In addition, we were able to collect several predation samples and fecal samples from the whales. By <b>Sunday, the whales were off Victoria</b> and as of <b>this morning they had reached the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>.

I spotted <b>3 orcas at 5:20 pm</b> today just west (up the beach) from <b>Puget Marina, 4181 Walnut Rd. Olympia</b>, 98516. They were<b> traveling southeast</b> towards the <b>Nisqually Reach/ River basin</b>.
<br/>Lat - N 47 degrees 6' 44.7501" Long - W 122 degrees 47' 41.6913"
<br/>They were traveling fast, 2 out in the channel and one cut in towards Salish sea inlet - then all three converged not 100' away from me and played for a couple minutes (awesome) then headed on towards the mouth of the Nisqually River. About 20 minutes after they left me I heard seals barking from the Nisqually Reach area - never heard that before! One was definitely bigger than the other two. And the fins were small and fairly sharply pointed. Definite large white eye patches. I'm assuming they're transients?
Saw 2 (I think, could have been three but definitely 2) orcas in the same strait headed the opposite direction Dec. 25th around 3:30 pm. But too far out in the channel to see any particular markings. Would love to know more about who's who and where! -Cate Montana

While prawning near <b>Flora Island at the southern end of Hornby Island, 12.30 pm,</b> I had the pleasure of watching a group of<b> transients, 6 or 7 </b>in number, including one juvenile, moving in on the 250 or so Stellers and California sealions that were either on shore or swimming in close proximity to the western side of Flora Island.  From a distance of approx 250 meters offshore, the whales were spyhopping and slowly swimming back and forth.  They then moved in underwater and rushed the sealions in the water in shallow water next to the Island. Pandemonium!   But I didnt see a kill. Shortly afterward, 4 or so animals headed south-but two remained behind. Preparing for another rush perhaps? I was back in the area today, and there was no sign of the orcas. Hope this helps. -Bryan Allen

<b>J50 to visit Seattle</b>. After touring Georgia Strait for the past week, J pod is now headed toward Seattle to show off its new baby, J50, to the city that was built on the shores of Puget Sound in 1852, and named in honor of the First Nations Chief Si'ahl (Seathl) who famously spoke of this beloved environment now tattered and occupied by more than 5 million people. The whales are really the First Nations to use this environment, long before the arrival of any humans, and we should respect that they are the ultimate icon of the Salish Sea web of life. Give thanks that they are still able to come visit us, and live life in such a way that future generations of both whales and humans can visit one another as they have done for thousands of years. Respect them,... they are still our iconic totem species, and the world will not forgive us if we do not care for them.

<b>K20 </b>south east bound north of Port Angeles. I came across what looked like <b>most of K pod and members of Lpod s</b>pread out across the<b> Juan de Fuca</b> <b>south east bound</b>.  The were spread from 2 miles <b>east of Race Rocks</b> to within 2 miles north of Ediz Hook, Port Angeles. -Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

It's a girl! Orca gender identified; her mother remains a mystery. As of this afternoon,<b> J pod, including the J16 clan, was near Nanaimo, B.C</b>., and headed south toward the Washington border, according to Tom Cogan, who was in the vicinity. -Chris Dunagan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

On the previous update (January 5), J27 and the rest of <b>J pod were off the northwest corner of Texada Island</b>. They continued northwest to near Campbell River, BC, and then looped around Tuesday and yesterday in the northern Strait of Georgia before heading on a more southerly course this morning. The near real-time locations from the satellite tag allowed staff from DFO Canada to readily locate the whales yesterday and confirm that the new calf, J50, was still alive.

<b>1:00 PM - </b>We sighted a pod of<b> 5 to 7 Orcas in Case Inlet</b>, east of Stretch Island. They had traveled to the north earlier in the day. When they returned to the south, they paused in this area to feed and play.

This <b>morning</b> I saw a large circle of disturbed water and bubbles. I knew something was up. I continued to watch and remembering the day before seeing a large <b>whalelike mammal</b> come out of the water and splash sideways twice. About 10 minutes went by...the water was calm again....and a seal appeared in the same area. It was swimming forward looking around and suddenly a large splash and back of what I think was a whale...it obviously got the seal...and all was calm again. This was in the Sinclair Inlet. We live on Perry Ave. Port Orchard, Wa.
Although I did not see white on the whale...<b>it must have been an Orca</b>....To me it seemed to have more of a squared off nose almost like a humpback look. But reading about whales eating seals...Must have been an Orca. -Melissa Oberlander.

<b>3:30 PM - </b>I spotted <b>three orca whales out in the water of Case Inlet in Allyn</b>. There were many seals out at play today on the water and once we spotted the orcas, the seals had disappeared. I had never seen orcas out on the water here before; it was so awesome to see! The three whales surfaced for air, blew up some water and were gone. The seals were out playing and after we had spotted the orcas the seals disappeared. -Nona Nelson

<b>Orcas Case Inlet</b>. We saw a pod of <b>5-7 orcas</b> at the north end of Case inlet (Allyn). We watched them go up to the end of the bay then turn around and go back. There was a much larger one with the rest being noticeably smaller. They were traveling with some activity that looked like they were feeding or trying to "corral " something, but seemed unsuccessful. -Susie Ingham

My wife and I saw <b>a pod of mammalian creatures</b> on Sunday, Jan. 4th, approx. <b>4:30 PST</b> about 1 mile north of Sea Ranch Lodge (straight out from Navigators Reach, <b>50 miles north of San Francisco</b>), roughly 0.5 mile off shore. The pod was slowly swirling in an amorphous group further out to sea and southward. I would suggest <b>our identification of these creatures as orcas is not terribly reliable-perhaps 20-30% likelihood at bes</b>t. My wife and I have seen orcas in captivity (and in film ;-) and dolphins many times in the wild and captivity. We never saw a nose or side of these animals which would have provided more information (e.g., bottle nose of a dolphin or white patch of an orca). The primary reason we considered orcas is that the animals and their dorsal fins seemed too large for dolphins. The only coloration we observed was grey, however. The dorsal fins were on the large size but had a nicely defined curve to them common to dolphins and uncharacteristic (as we know it) for orcas. To us, "bottlenose" seems to be the most likely explanation, if it's plausible that so many of the individuals would be on the large size. We can not provide an accurate total count because the animals were in constant movement and never surfaced all at once. Thrice a group of 3-4 surfaced together (in close proximity to each other) and 2 or 3 surfaced over the next few seconds but in more dispersed locations. The total population was at least 6, perhaps about 8, but could even have been more.

Had a short but amazing encounter with <b>transient orcas</b> just before sunset! It was the<b> T060's and T002B in Harney Channel</b> (between Shaw and Orcas islands) and they ended up making a kill right off the stern! Good amount of blood in the water and some remains (looked like lungs) sank beside the boat. I could even see bits of meat in the mouths of the orcas as they swam past! Pics and GoPro footage will be posted soon! -Melisa Pinnow

<b>Orca in Henderson Bay</b>. Video by Christie Fierro. Several hours edited into a few minutes.

I am not sure if they were playing together or maybe the orca were hunting the porpoise. After studying the fins closer, I suspect this is a transient orca pod (the meat eaters). But, I am not sure. -Christie Fierro

<b>Cape Meares, OR,</b> Park Ranger Travis Corby reports seeing <b>a pod of one adult male and two smaller orcas two hundred yards off the cape between noon and 1:30 pm </b>today, heading north toward Tillamook Bay, OR. Park visitors had reported seeing more orcas - possibly up to 10 earlier in the day, and seals and sea lions were all on the rocks. He said the visitors reported the orcas were attacking a crab pots - I asked if they were doing that by tail lobbing the crab pot buoy and he said yes. This is incredible, as we've just had two reports of that happening with Transients in Puget Sound this past week - but something we have never seen or heard of before - interesting! Anyone else out there remember seeing Transients (or Residents?) attacking crab pots in the past?

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

After the above report was posted on the Orca Network facebook page this report of the same encounter appeared: Chris Fisher Hill I was there watching the greys at<b> Cape Meares and first spotted the Orcas</b> today. At first they were in the inlet towards the rocks with the seals. They lingered for almost half an hour working their way around the lighthouse point and off to the north. some seemed to be working in circles possibly fishing. I watched one throw, roll, slap etc the crab pot.<b> There were at least 10. </b>What a sighting of a lifetime. I still can't believe it. Oh yeah and they grey whales were abundant too!
<br/><i>A possible explanation: It is not uncommon that crab pot bait attracts swarms of mysiids and other zooplankton, which sometimes attracts fish. Perhaps the orca are trying to stun fish associated with the pot or buoy.
