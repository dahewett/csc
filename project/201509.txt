<b>L122 is a boy!</b> Oh Boy! They came through <b>President's Channel </b>which was a first for me! We were skunked on All Aboard Sailing in the morning by fog. But then, after hanging with a humpback, meeting up at sunset with the <b>Js, Ks and Ls south of Flattop </b>was just... incredible. More breaches than I've ever seen... and <b>L91</b> rolled around her calf <b>L122</b>, less than a month old, to reveal he is a boy. (we await official confirmation from the Center for Whale Research) -Barbara Bender 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
Tonight was one of those night's that we dream about out here ... Let me paint the picture for you in words: <b>forty plus resident orcas traveling up the Orcas Island coastline</b>, socializing, breaching, syphoping, cartwheeling, and surfacing in respiratory synchronicity in the late afternoon sun. Backlit blows, water that was like glass, my best friend on board, and the sound of their exhalations carrying on for miles like the harmonic sound of water dripping on pebbles. There's nothing that get's me quite like the "koof, koof, koof" of a pod of orca surfacing all at the same time, displaying ties of social familiarity and family unity. They're so close to one another - neurologically programed to take care of each other with an innate sense of family that exceeds our human ties. To them, this social and tactile behavior that we're fortunate enough to witness is vital for their survival. It's an incredibly powerful thing. Humans could learn so much from these black and white mystics. I will stop at nothing to protect these orcas and try to bring back their primary food source, Chinook/King salmon so that our lives will continue to be enriched by their presence. We need to do our part so that they're around for generations to come. -Heather MacIntyre

<b>3:35 p.m. -</b> My husband and I were heading towards <b>Sucia Island</b>. About 1 mile south of <b>Matia Island </b>we noticed several boats stopped, so we slowed down and lo and behold we saw a pod of orcas heading north and two going south. This was my first siting while on our own boat. Loved seeing a little one following its Mama.... -Susan Waters

Big mixed groups of<b> J's, K's and L's </b>including the newest one, <b>L122</b>. The vocals were insane! especially at sunset....it was a pretty surreal setting sitting at sand heads at sunset with whales everywhere squawking away, man, are we lucky to have the opportunity to do this every day. -Gary Sutton

Tonights beautiful encounter with the <b>J14 and L4 matrilines</b>. We watched the two groups join up <b>in Haro Strait </b>and form one huge 'cuddle puddle'.

<b>11:12 a.m. - central Puget Sound -</b> have been seeing blows and breaches way across the sound from <b>Alki</b>, north of Winslow. Looks like <b>humpbacks</b>, not orcas. Very stiff and cold wind, hard to see. But beautiful! -Trileigh Tucker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:59 a.m. -central Puget Sound</b> - They were a ways off and the waters pretty rough. I saw simultaneous blows as well. The one who was breaching appeared to be slightly smaller, but again I was a ways off. They've gotten slightly further out of my sight slowly trending north. Big splashes off and on. A couple were not far from the ferry as it passed, so hoping someone on there might send an update.
<br/><b>10:30 a.m. - It's a breaching humpback!</b> Just saw a huge splash. <b>North of Alki</b>. There's two of them, one looks smaller...Lots of breaching again! Milling in the same area 10:36. Blows visible without binoculars north of Alki beach. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 .a.m. - central Puget Sound - </b>Maia at WA State Ferries relayed a report of an undetermined number of orcas (later ID'd as <b>humpbacks </b>by several people -ALB) <b>off Alki Point,</b> possibly southbound.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Central Puget Sound - </b>I saw them from the <b>9:40 ferry from Bainbridge</b> this morning: awesome athletics! Just finished a mtg in west Seattle so I figured I'd come down and take a look but I'm not seeing anything from the lighthouse. -Lisa Sibbett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>11:03 a.m. - Orcas</b> heading north toward <b>Lime Kiln</b> mid channel. Lots of boats. -Jack Nolan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Point No Point at 7:30 </b>tonight with at least 100 other people waiting for the eclipse to start when the humpback blew and dove about 200 yards off the beach just south of the lighthouse. Then we saw it blow and dive a few more times before it headed north toward <b>Hansville and Foul Weather Bluff</b>. -Jan Clare

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Many people gathered at <b>Point No Point </b>to watch the eclipse, and just as the moon began to be visible, the humpback came by! It was close to the beach when first spotted, then moved on to the west. -Marilyn DeRoy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hello I don't see any reports from yesterday on the website, but hopefully someone with knowledge and experience saw the whale we saw off of <b>West Beach in West Seattle</b>. The whale was surfacing and blowing as we stepped out of our car at the condos there at West Beach (south of Brace Point), and I only had a glimpse of its back so I'm not sure which kind of whale it was. I'm pretty sure it had a fin on its back, and it was really a large creature - and very close to shore, maybe 100 yards or even less. The whale seemed to be alone and was headed north. It continued to blow occasionally, but unfortunately it did not surface for another look to see what kind it was. I hope this is helpful. -Ellen Cole
(no positive ID but the description fits and there have been several reports of humpbacks in the general area of Alki, Vashon, Blake Island- ALB)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:31 p.m. - </b>Saw some blows and pec slaps from a <b>Humpback just off Point No Point</b> just about 15 minutes ago. He was heading towards Whidbey Island the last dive he took. -Gail Greenwald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:03 a.m. - Humpbacks 1/2 mile east of Bainbridge Island </b>on the North side! -Dylan McCoy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. - Two humpbacks off President Point/Kingston </b>(Port Madison whales), one of which is tail slapping like crazy!!! -Chris Otterson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:15-10:45</b> from upper terrace of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline watched<b> two humpbacks west of mid channel off Faye Bainbridge Park</b>. Surface times about every 8- 10 minutes with occasional breaches and tail lobs, 2-4 in succession. Slowly drifting northward then again southward but keeping to the same general location. Much gull activity across the Sound with several very large bait balls out there! -Alisa, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:20 a.m. - </b> Sequence, breaching <b>Humpback calf off Port Madison!</b> Mother nearby taking deep dives. Breached 20+ times in a row and still going when Victoria Clipper 3 left the scene! -Justine Buckmaster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Elyse Margaret reports Thomas Judd witnessed <b>a humpback early this morning at Point No Point</b>.

<br/>

A five-year-old <b>playing with a Chinook salmon</b>. We left from <b>Orcas island</b>, not totally sure where we were when we saw them, but I want to say it was something like six miles off from Friday Harbor. -Danny Auerbach

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Smaller of <b>two humpbacks </b>spent the better part of the morning breaching while a larger whale foraged close by. Near<b> Port Madison in Puget Sound</b>. -Justine Buckmaster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L89 Solstice</b> surfacing west of<b> Hein Bank </b>today. The big guy was cruising along slowly, appearing to be in resting pattern and eventually came over next to the boat. He was swimming around while other whales foraged. There were fish there. <b>L113</b> caught a salmon right in front of us and looked to be teasing <b>L121</b> with it. Solstice is 23 yrs old. -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L88, Wave Walker</b>, takes a break from hunting for salmon to breach!  We watched him just southwest of <b>Salmon Bank </b>on Saturday from the Island Explorer 4. -Bart Rulon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

On another truly spectacular "mill-pond-like" day, we headed out in search of whales. Little did we know that a <b>humpback</b> whale would steal the day as we headed towards <b>Salmon Bank</b> to find our Resident orcas. The humpback was very active with hundreds of pectoral fin slaps, and amazing tail lobs, it was difficult to leave! Thankfully we continued on and found <b>members of L-pod, notably L89 Solstice, his mom L22 Spirit, L77 Matia, L119 Joy</b> and many others, spread over a large area. After visiting with these majestic whales, on our return trip we found the same humpback, still active. He surfaced one time totally decorated with bull kelp, on the head, body, and his tail. What a sight - and what an amazing day! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<b>Humpbacks</b> still hanging around between<b> Edmonds, So.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:18 p.m. - </b>from my location half a mile inland, the <b>humpbacks are in line with Double Bluff</b>, but from the ferry terminal, it will probably be more inline with Scatchet Head. There are 2 here, <b>closer to Edmonds than Whidbey Island</b>. The third one that I see near PNP is very far away (the farthest I've ever seen a humpback from my home) and is much closer to PNP than Whidbey Island.
<br/><b>6:00 p.m. </b>- Make that<b> three humpbacks, one by PNP and two nearer to Edmonds</b>, maybe 2-3 miles NNW of the ferry terminal. And the one near PNP is more like a mile off PNP, judging by its distance vs. a tug on MarineTraffic.
<br/><b>5:20 p.m. - </b>I am seeing <b>two humpbacks </b>in the north sound. The first is <b>halfway between Edmonds and Double Bluff.</b> The second is way <b>far away from Edmonds near Point No Point (PNP)</b>.

Today we traveled 2 hours (well worth the wait) before our first sighting of whales. We found <b>transients (near Hannah Heights)</b> moving quickly south along San Juan Island. <b>J &amp; K pod were southbound not far behind! </b>We had both residents and transients in the same area! We continued northbound, and suddenly, we saw <b>Dall's porpoises </b>rocketing across the water. Some of the residents turned to play with them, and then the porpoise headed our way, bowriding for a few seconds. It was amazing! We turned back south visiting with residents before returning to the transients, ID'd as the <b>T049As (T049A2 not present). T049A1 </b>snagged a harbor seal and the family proceeded to breach and spyhop after the kill. As we headed home, we came across<b> two humpbacks</b>. We stayed with one for awhile trying to get an ID shot on the fluke, but he'd never show his tail. As we were about to leave, he suddenly started pec slapping for about 10 minutes. He approached the boat (we'd been totally stationary at this point) doing his backstroke and you could see his whole body under the water. He even cartwheeled once and trumpeted twice! What a day! -Rachel Haight

<b>One, possibly two humpbacks </b>feeding actively, viewed from<b> 5:15 pm to 7:45 pm</b>. surface activity and shallow dives, surfacing every 3 -5 minutes with longer breaks when moving onto another feeding area. The whale had reddish-orange coloration on its back fin, quite hooked shape, never saw tail or pectoral fins. appeared quite large when seen close to a watching boat. at one point possibly two whales given length of distance between blows that were only seconds apart, but not sure. We saw the <b>humpback in Rosario Strait:</b> east of Obstruction Pass (south-east side of Orcas Island), traveling north to <b>Buck Bay (east side of Orcas Island)</b>, swimming within a half mile of the east shore of Orcas Island, then circling back (further east, approximately in the shipping channel) and swimming south to Obstruction Pass, then going north again to Buck Bay and turning south again, but this time staying close to the east shore of Orcas Island.  Then it got too dark to see.  We saw it the late afternoon and evening of Sept 22, and then again the afternoon of Sept 23 also for several hours, repeating its cruising up and down the shore feeding, then at about 4:30 pm the whale kept going north of Doe Bay and we did not see it again. -Amy Mower

At 85-90 feet long, Fin whales, also known as Finbacks, are the second largest animal on the planet! Second only to the blue whale. These guys were hunted out of the Salish Sea before commercial whaling was banned in 1966. They have not been seen in these inland waters for several years and some say even over a decade.

We saw SO MANY whales today! I can't recall the last time I saw this many of them so close together. They were traveling for sure, but there was also a lot of social behavior as well as what looked like a resting line at times. Here is a sampling of groupings we saw between<b> J's and K's, possibly L's</b>. An interesting mix. Its gonna take a while for me to figure out who all was there! But we had a few guest appearances along with the usual suspects. And, of course, the J16's were, for the most part, dancing to their own tune away from the rest. -Renee Beitzel

I arrived at <b>Point No Point</b> today @ <b>3:00</b> spotted a <b>Humpback</b> just <b>South of Possession Point</b>. We continued to watch for hours, over &amp; over , many times we saw the Humpback surface, 1-4 blows and then take a big dive with the fluke way up in the air... This whale headed North towards the yellow buoy, directly across from Pont No Point. and continued milling further North just South of Double Bluff. Turning back around in the area , going away from PNP and then coming back for a closer look, keeping perimeters south of Double Bluff then treading south of the yellow buoy , towards Possession Point. I left @ 6:30 last sighting was just south of the yellow buoy closer to Possession Point. Days like this makes my heart happy,  and a reminder to buy a powerful lens/camera. -Kathe Bradley

Day report: Cool and misty day, with light winds, as we headed out toward<b> Smith Island and McArthur Bank</b> to catch up with some <b>humpbacks</b>, and they were magnificent! One did a full out-of-the-water breach! We watched two as they moved through the area, feeding on small fish. One was catalog number <b>MMX0006</b>, with close to an all black tail fluke, and the other had a lot of white, but I couldn't find a match in the catalog. (see photo below) They eventually joined up and swam quite close to each other, giving us some wonderful views of their flukes and rostrums... -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Sometimes an encounter can become quite special in the blink of an eye. We were out hanging with some orcas, when we approached a small group. It became very apparent that this particular orca had a tiny, blip of a shadow. Turns out I got to meet<b> L122, the new L Pod baby with Mom, L91</b>.

I'm confident that I witnessed <b>2 Humpbacks</b> blowing and slapping tails elsewhere. They were about halfway between<b> Points Monroe and Jefferson</b>, seen from Fay Bainbridge. There was a crowd of visiting school children watching and shouting with each splash, but the whales were just too far away for anyone to make a positive ID. After an hour or so-between about<b> 1-2 PM</b>-most watchers gave up. The shared assumption was Orcas, but now I'm convinced that they were <b>Humpbacks</b>, mostly because the slashes were large but no one really ever saw a breaching body. There were also sailboats in the general vicinity, but none too close. -James Hill

Got to spend a calm <b>afternoon</b> with members of the <b>K13 and K16 matrilines</b>. They were actively fishing along the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> just north of Eagle Cove. -Connie Bickerton

Amazing evening with the <b>T036a's and 075b's in Active Pass, BC</b>. We headed north after debating whether to go south into rough seas to see Residents, a sure thing, or go north into calm seas on the chance that we might find the Ts. With the help of Lance Underwood on Taku, we found them. Watching them take a seal at the eastern entrance to Active was spectacular. -Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

30 minutes off the dock and we come across the <b>T137s</b>. As we were traveling along parallel to them, they suddenly turned right toward the boat. I was on the upper deck looking straight down as two orcas surfaced looking up at me. They went under the boat and on the other side, one surfaced on its side RIGHT next to the boat. It was WOW! We left them for a little bit and then found <b>3 humpbacks</b>. One of them even breached! On our way back to see the T137s, we came across a Steller sea lion feasting on a skate! It was such fun to watch him whip it around and eat it! We thought the orcas might sneak up on this Steller, but no, they found a different one! We got on scene in time to watch the orcas methodically and successfully hunt a Steller sea lion. We were all waiting for the orcas to send it flying in the air, and sure enough, they did! The entire trip was pretty special, and I'm not sure today's trip will be topped for a long time. There is nothing more incredible than watching transients take down prey! -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I was witness to something intense and Nat Geo worthy. A family of Bigg's killer whales, the <b>T137s, took down a large Steller sea lion</b>. Did you know that Steller sea lions can grow up to 2,400 lbs and have a skull similar to that of a grizzly bear? These are formidable predators in their own right, but are no match for a hungry killer whale. T137 was by far the most acrobatic of the four whales involved, though her youngest, T137D, was definitely very involved and tried her best to help take down the sea lion. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Here are just a few among many action photos from the <b>T137 pod</b> attack on a Steller sea lion due <b>south of Lopez Island</b> from the Island Explorer 3.  T137 did a lot of the hard work in this attack, slashing around, lunging, and trying to keep the sea lion from coming up at times, but the whole family definitely participated.  Even little T137D lunged at the sea lion on several occasions!  At one point T137 lunged out of the water appearing to plunge the sea lion back under with her left pectoral fin!  The biggest, breath taking, moment happened when T137 knocked the sea lion completely out of the water by ramming it with her head!    Every once in a while the pod would swim slowly away from the sea lion about 50 yards almost as if they lost interest, and to do some socializing, but they always returned to give their prey more punishment.   I've seen a handful of transient attacks on Steller's over the years, and they have always been really intense!  This one ranks right up there as one of the best!  It was a stunning exhibit of how powerful these animals are. -Bart Rulon

<b>7:30 p.m. -</b> We spotted <b>at least two (perhaps 3) humpback whales off of Point No Point</b>. We saw two dorsal fins and then a blow. It could've been the same whale that had turned. That's why we're not certain of the number. They swam back and forth varying between <b>200-300 feet off of the Point</b>. We saw them blow a number of times and diving. Saw their tails more than six times. We watched them for about 30 minutes. They were not orcas because of the short dorsal fin and large size. It was quite exciting! -Maria Stienbeisser

I was out fishing with my grandpa  when we spotted<b> a humpback whale along Sunrise Beach in Gig Harbor</b>...It also appeared to be by itself.... I shouldn't say it was entirely alone. It was actually swimming with one or two porpoises (Pacific white-sided dolphins-ALB). It was interesting because for nearly an hour, they swam together. Often, when the whale spouted water, the porpoise would leap out of the water simultaneously or seconds after....-Dieter Veitenhans

I've attached a photo I took of <b>J50</b> breaching from the Island Explorer 3 near <b>Hein Bank</b>.  <b>J50 and J52</b> were swimming together by themselves and playing the whole time during our visit with them!  They breached, tailslapped, lunged around, spyhopped, and seemed to have a fantastic time with each other.  At one point they also did a double spyhop!  Eventually J36 swam in and joined them, but it didn't stop the the little duo from playing one bit!  It's hard not to have a big smile on your face when you see these little calves having such a good time together - seemingly without a care in the world.  It feels like lots of hope looking forward with so many new calves! -Bart Rulon

<b>9 :00 p.m. - </b>We saw <b>at least two humpbacks near Foul Weather Bluff in Skunk Bay</b> from our home which is located on a high bluff overlooking the Sound near Hansville, WA. They were about 500 meters off shore. There seemed to be at least two of them - one noticeably larger than the other(s). The large whale had a nearly all-white fluke underside when fluking. They were too far away to get decent pictures. They didn't seem to be heading anywhere but rather to be going slowly back and forth in a 500-square-meter area, spouting and fluking. We watched them for at least an hour. There were several small boats in the area - fishing boats and a sailboat under power - that seemed to be watching them, too. 
<br/>The night before (11th), we also saw a few spouts and flukes in roughly the same location, and after dark we had heard the unmistakable whooshing of a whale spouting/breathing about 5-6 times every few minutes in front of the bluff moving in what seemed to be an west-east direction. We could not see it, but it seemed to be closer to shore since the breathing sound was quite loud. -Tom Buell Jr.

This is a couple of days late but I wanted to share since the encounter was with the <b>L-54's</b>. It was my first time to see them and they are somewhat rare to encounter. On board The Legacy, we started out on the <b>west side of San Juan Island at Kanaka Bay</b> where the<b> J-17's</b> were foraging close to shore. I guess my path is destined to cross with this group as I have seen matriarch Princess Angeline and family three out of the last three trips. Due to the number of whale watch, commercial fishing and pleasure boats, we didn't stay long and departed for Hein Bank. There we found the L-54's in an absolutely beautiful setting with calm seas, blue skies and a Mt Baker which is just a tad whiter these days. It was extra special to watch orphaned and adopted Wave Walker take a turn at babysitting Ino's youngest calf for a while. -Debbie Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 a.m. - </b>A group of about<b> 5-6</b> showed up to join the fishing boats just before 11am. A bit of tail slapping followed by several breaches from one of the younger ones, before they seemed to split up and look for fish. Most of us pulled up our fishing gear and enjoyed the show - it was fun to see everyone pause to admire creatures far better at fishing than we will ever be! -Jennifer Wapenski

The <b>T065A's</b> are a small group of <b>transient killer whales</b>. They eat marine mammals, not fish. This group was on a mission!

My 6th encounter with this family (<b>T65As</b>) this year, and as Sara said, it was a charm. This family group is so much fun to hang out with. Today they were wandering south along<b> Lummi Island</b> before heading over to do some serious hunting along the shores of Orcas Island. This family of whales is very curious of boats and people, and they came in to check us out several times. -Connie Bickerton

EPIC. That was the day we had on the water with the <b>T65As, T65A, T65A5, T65A4, T65A2, and T65A3</b> today. We found them up near <b>Lummi Island</b> and they were in a playful mood the whole time we were with them----well, playful and hungry! It sure wasn't a great day to be a harbor seal. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Today was a pretty epic day with the <b>T065As</b>. They came close to the boat by THEIR choice. They breached, jumped, and tail lobbed. We watched as they caught an unfortunate seal who became their meal. When they were swimming in the shallows, you could even see their jet black bodies underneath the surface and it was breathtaking. They are definitely one of my favorite family groups by far, and they like to have fun and are such a delight to watch. Such a beautiful amazing day on the water spent with friends, couldn't have asked for better. -Rachel Haight

We watched for nearly an hour before they moved closer to Baby Island (a seal snack perhaps?) and it got too dark to see. Great fun! -Steve Liedle

While searching for THE Fin whale today, we spotted it once and waited for it to resurface. In the meantime, we happened upon a pretty active bird pile/bait ball. A bait ball is a tight ball of fish (herring, capelin, sand-lance) that have come together at the surface due to being driven there by a predator from below. These can be seals, sea lions, porpoise, birds or more likely, minke whales! We found this one surface lunging through the bait ball and a few birds (Ok several) that were taking advantage of the fish that were stunned as they were left in the path of <b>a feeding minke</b>. -Renee Beitzel

I talked to reporting party,  Robin Waterman, She is reporting seeing <b>a whale from her cabin at Quilcene</b>.  She said the animal is large (maybe 30 feet), dark in color with a blowhole.  No dorsal fin seen. She didn't notice any blotchiness in the coloration. The animal surfaced near the shore in an area that drops off to deep water fairly quickly.  She hopped into a kayak and tried to paddle out to get a closer look but the animal showed what she thinks was a large pec flipper and dove from sight. The sighting occurred around <b>0915 to 0930</b> and she hasn't see the animal resurface in the area as of 0945. -Brent Norberg, NOAA

A wonderful day on the water including a rare sighting of a <b>Fin Whale</b>! The day started off with a report of Transient orcas near Whidbey but they were sneaky T's and we never found them. A few minutes later we found a whale, it looked quite beat up with a weird fin, no fluke, turns out we may have been one of two boats that saw it today, sounds like it may be a young Fin Whale!!...next we found L41 Mega, he was supposedly with a few other L's but was by himself when we found him. We spent some quality time with <b>Mega</b> then found a <b>Minke whale</b> on our way to <b>Protection Island</b>. Lots of wildlife to see today, with Captain Anna hitting the trifecta! -Janine Harles

Whales at any time of the year are a gift, September whales especially so as sightings become a little less regular. Magnificent<b> Mega (L41), Matia (L77)</b> and other L pod members milled and foraged <b>near Salmon Bank off the west side of San Juan Island</b> today. Although initially fairly well spread out, the whales appeared to be grouping up as Mystic Sea left. Our visiting Steller sea-lions, always an impressive sight, were hauled out on Whale Rocks enjoying the afternoon sunshine before the rain. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist

<b>4:50 p.m. - Orcas on west Whidbey (south of Bush Point, Admiralty Inlet)</b> slowly moving north, as if feeding. 4 females, one male. No spectacular behavior, just surfacing and slow dives. Adams Road earliest we've ever seen them go by. -Christina Baldwin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:45 p.m. -  saw blows just outside Cultus Bay</b> so at least some appear to be coming around <b>south end of Whidbey</b>.
<br/><b>2:10 p.m. </b>- From Stamm Overlook in <b>Edmonds</b> they (at least some) were breaching about 1-1.5 miles south of Scatchet Head, south Whidbey. Due to distance and sea chop no direction discernible.
<br/><b>1:45 p.m. - </b>They (or at least some) did not choose Admiralty...they are keeping a line <b>northward towards south Whidbey</b>.
<br/><b>1:35 p.m. - </b>most of pod (<b>10-12, with 3 large males</b>) has grouped up into two groups with some separation, large male leading and ahead of both groups. They appear to have kept a line which has moved them off shore...they are northbound in southbound shipping lanes. Appear to be angling Admiralty but not certain at this time.
<br/><b>12:58 p.m. - </b> From Sunset Ave in Edmonds, pod is <b>northbound, north side of Apple Tree Point Kingston on Kitsap side</b>, a bit spread out, with a couple closer to shore.
<br/><b>12:30 p.m. -</b>  From earlier reports hear that <b>pod</b> has flipped and is <b>now northbound</b>. From Richmond Beach, pod just passed out <b>from Kingston ferry dock northbound </b>at a steady pace. -Alisa, ON

<b>11:30 a.m. -  </b>Just got a report the <b>T's are now back up at Faye Bainbridge</b>. Lots of action. -Susan Marie Andersson (At least some flipped somewhere around Rolling Bay and are now northbound)


<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 a.m. - T's</b> have moved back west and are right off <b>Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Island</b>.
<br/><b>10:30am.</b> (from South Beach, B.I.) Seeing them off the point at <b>Discovery Park</b>. Heading up to watch from Rolling Bay again. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:05 a.m. -</b> I just caught a glimpse of them from<b> lower Queen Anne</b> (with binocs) surfacing right around the orange buoy. From here it looks like the buoy is just <b>south of Rockaway</b>, but I could be wrong on that. Saw them surface once and they've been back down for the last five minutes or so. -Katie Kirking

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:15 a.m. -</b> Watching from <b>Rolling Bay on Bainbridge and see 6-7 fins</b>, long dives, still trending south, mid channel. South of 2nd marker. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

<b>1:44 p.m. - </b>Seen a beautiful<b> wild pod </b>heading south by <b>Marrowstone</b> just now. All looked well! Large male. <b>Huge dorsal fin</b> with a distinctive notch on the upper back side. I believe there were <b>about 5-6</b> and we believe a baby was also on board. -Niboreel Sreyas
