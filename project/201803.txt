<b>Yukusam the sperm whale finds his way south into the Salish Sea!</b> -Photo by Sara McCullagh, March 31, 2018 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Sperm whale</b> - March 31 - Yesterday was one for the memory books! <b>The sperm whale that had been sighted in Johnstone Strait in February made an appearance in the San Juan Islands</b> and I (feeling like I won the lottery) was lucky enough to see him. I've included a link to the BLOG POST I helped write about Yukusam for Maya's Legacy Whale Watching (with more photos and a video that has audio of him echolocating). Never did I imagine I would see a sperm whale (my first ever!) here in the Salish Sea, let alone in Haro Strait as the sun disappeared behind Vancouver Island. Yukusam, you are amazing! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Sperm whale</b>, that is! Yukusam the sperm whale was spotted <b>in Haro Strait</b> last night during our first sunset whale watch &amp; wildlife tour of 2018. Usually living in the deep waters of the Pacific coast, he is a very rare visitor to the island waters of the Salish Sea! Sperm whales are the largest toothed predators on the planet and can grow to lengths of 60 feet.
<b>First spotted mid February in northeast Vancouver Island</b>, the sperm whale slowly made his way south. This is the first ever sighting of a sperm whale in the waters surrounding San Juan Island. -Photo of the day and photo below by Capt. Sarah McCullagh, San Juan Safaris

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I was captain onboard J1, which departed Friday Harbor at 4:00 PM and were headed to Swanson Channel to catch up with J pod. As we were crossing Boundary Pass we spotted a huge blow in the pass, followed by a fluke. At first we thought it was a humpback but it was across the pass and we didn't get a great look. We waited 25 minutes with no other surfacing and moved on to J pod. About 20 minutes later San Juan Safaris reacquired and confirmed it was a<b> sperm whale Yukusam off Turn Point, Stuart Island.</b> After a 35 - 40 minute dive, J1 and Forever Wild spotted the next surfacing offshore of the Turn Point lighthouse. -Jeff Friedman, Maya's Legacy

Here is a shot from Saturday, our new visitor <b>"Yukusam" making an appearance off Turn Point</b>...an amazing encounter, if a little brief! -Photo by Joe Zelwietro, Prince of Whales, March 31, 2018

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Scott Veirs of OrcaSound.net shared THIS BLOG POST, with links to listen in to the <b>incredible vocals heard from "Yukusam" the Sperm whale</b> as he traveled down <b>Haro Strait</b> last night, after being seen off Turn Point by several whale watch boats

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

In case you missed it: the <b>sperm whale nicknamed Yukusam was echolocating in Haro Strait for over 3 hours on the evening </b>of March 31st! This is the same whale that was seen in Johnstone Strait in mid-February (the first confirmed sperm whale there since 1984), and we believe this is also the first documented sperm whale in Washington's inland waters. This 5 minute clip encompasses a nice variety of the clicks we heard from him this evening! Pretty special! -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

After receiving several reports throughout the morning of <b>J pod on the west side of San Juan Island</b>, Dave, Darren, and Lodie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat just before <b>1300</b>. We got on scene ten minutes later about <b>three quarters of a mile northwest of the Lime Kiln lighthouse</b>. We shut down on the edge of the scene to get a sense of what the whales were doing. A large, tight group of whales approached slowly from the south. This was all of the<b> J11s, J14s, and J19s</b> and they filed right by the boat in a nice pass and then began heading west across the strait....See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 22.

March 31st was another awesome day on the water with probably <b>14 mammal eating orcas.</b> They were heading from <b>Campbell River to Comox </b>with many of them very, very close to the Vancouver Island shores. -Peter Hamilton

March 31- North Saratoga Passage - HI! Just wanted to report seeing <b>two Grays in Crescent Harbor last night</b> just after high tide (starting at about <b>6:30PM</b>) (March 31) feeding until sunset. One was much farther and couldn't be captured well. <b>Gray whale #44 Dubknuck feeding in the shallows in Crescent Harbor</b> just after high tide and until sunset, just feet from Kes and his family, their first experience! His little ones will have this beautiful connection with #44, an experience they can hold with them through out their lives! Our family's first whale watching experience! Spectacular animals! -Kes Andrius

March 31- Saratoga/Possession - <b>2:44 p.m. - Spotted a blow off Baby Island</b>. Headed south off Camano state park. -Sara Wright

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

A beautiful sunny spring day! On our first trip of the day, we went out to <b>Camano Head, where we caught up with gray whale #531</b> as she was foraging for delectable ghost shrimp. We then found <b>#22, Earhart, on the east side of Gedney Island</b>, close to shore and blowing bubble blasts as she surfaced. Turning east, <b>#49, Patch</b>, gave us some great looks at his namesake marking and a nice tail fluke. Further southeast, <b>Shackleton</b> was in deeper water. On the afternoon trip, we found<b> #22</b> again, and were treated to even nicer tail fluke up dives after she turned away from the shallow Snohomish River Delta. <b>#49 </b>was also in that area. As we headed back to Langley, we found an unidentified gray very close to shore, just south of Sandy Point. This whale was in such shallow water that he/she was on the side, with one pectoral (front) flipper up in the air, and at times, showing both the front pec and one side of the tail flukes. The backlit blows really showed the lovely heart shape of a gray whale's exhalation. Another wonderful day on the water! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:02 a.m - 22 and 53 south side of Gedney. 49 to the east and we found 531 between Camano Head and Gedney</b>. -Renee Beitzel

March 31 ~ <b>7:00 p.m. -</b> On Saturday evening, just before sunset, my daughter, girlfriend, and I were on <b>Samish Overlook</b> and we saw <b>a HUGE whale</b> in the water, very near the shore, just south of Colony Creek...I remember the moment, looking below and seeing what looked like a long dark spear moving perpendicularly away from the coast. It took me a moment to be sure that it was something, and I asked my daughter, who has sharper vision, if she saw it, and she said, "it's HUGE". We saw it moving about near the surface or just under it, on and off for a few minutes. Then we saw it no more. We tried to compare it to a long vessel that was anchored just north of Colony Creek...It looked much bigger than 20-30 feet to me.  So, my hunch is that the whale was 40-50 feet long.  At first it was swimming at, or near the surface, straight as an arrow, perpendicularly away from the coast fairly fast.  It looked just like that, a long thin arrow moving away from the coast.  It was as though it might have moved in to chase a seal, which had escaped by going onto the dyke, and the whale now was heading back out to deep water.  It stopped about 200-300 ft from shore and stayed near that area, resting, swimming in small circles, occasionally diving deep enough to be out of view.  Then we saw it no more. -Myron Shekelle

<b>7:30 p.m. - two gray whales</b> were feeding in approximately 30 feet of water, tails in the surface water. They worked the drop off there for about a half an hour slowly moving south. (Really fun to watch). They were approximately <b>3 miles due west of Kayak Point</b>, 300 yards off Camano Island. This is the 3rd year in a row that we have spotted them. -Mike Fox, Camano Island

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Gray whales - <b>1118 - #53</b> changing directions heading South. <b>#21</b> still slowly heading North.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:54 p.m. -</b> Blowing spotted off <b>Utsalady Point</b>. Looks to be milling around for the last 40 minutes or so. I think only 1 whale. Exciting to see one from my house! I think there may have been two, they stayed in one spot for about 4 hours. Fun. -Dean Kayler

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:57 a.m. - I see blows at Cresent Harbor. Polnell Point</b>. -Terica Ginther

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

March 30 - <b>3:55 p.m. - Observing gray about 50 yards from shore</b> on side feeding with pec in air. Gray was northbound at <b>Mabana</b> last seen in front of boat launch. Initially headed south then turned back north. Pec fin of gray whale 531 - Saratoga Passage. -Krista Paulino

<b>Grey whale 125 yards off Bells Beach at 2pm</b> today. It was heading towards Langley. -Rick Lessley

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We were fortunate to quickly find <b>2 of our "Sounders" just south of Langley, #49 Patch, feeding with #22 Earhart on the west side of Hat/Gedney Island</b> - their shallow dives giving us many great views as they slowly traveled southbound. We then headed towards <b>Cama Head and found #53, Little Patch</b>, who seemed to be on a mission towards the north. So we headed on into Port Susan and discovered<b> #21 Shackleton feeding along Kayak Point</b>. He was very close to shore, only a few people on shore watching as he meandered back and forth. So good to see 4 of our gray whales - on a very welcome sunny day with no wind - is spring finally here? -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>Two grey whales off Everett spotted this afternoon at 1:45 pm.</b> About 2.5 miles north of Everett Naval base. They surprised us by popping up right next to the boat. Traveling very slowly. But not diving very often, so they didn't appear to be feeding. 47 59.919'N 122 16.152'W. -Photo by Russ Waughmab, March 30, 2018

March 28 - Admiralty Inlet - First orcas of the season! After spending some time with <b>gray whales #21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart</b>, we raced around Whidbey Island to catch up with the <b>T37As and the T99s</b>! We were surprised with a sudden close pass as the orcas left a kill, birds picking up scraps in their wake, and <b>raced toward Hood Canal</b>. Then, they slowed in an apparent resting line as they rounded Foulweather Bluff. What a great day, despite the rain! 
<br/><b>11:28 a.m - They seem intent on heading into Hood Canal.</b> Now past Foulweather Bluff on the NE side. T37As are here too.
<br/><b>11:00 a.m. - At least the T99s </b>possibly others with them. They're heading straight for <b>Foulweather Bluff</b> now.
<br/>1<b>0:50 a.m. -</b> Chilkat Express on scene with <b>~10 orcas in Admiralty Inlet. South of Bush Point aiming towards Hood Canal</b>. Will update with IDs shortly. -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:10 p.m. -</b> It looks like they've <b>gone into Hood Canal</b>, halfway to the bridge.
<br/><b>11:25 a.m. - </b>they seem to be over near the <b>west side of the entrance to Hood Canal</b> now, way on the Jefferson/Kitsap side. -Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:28 am. - These are the T99s and T37As, in Puget Sound</b>. -Bart Rulon, Chilkat Express 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:45 a.m. - Orcas in Admiralty Inlet heading south off Mutiny Bay,</b> mid-channel. Looked like a take-down a minute ago with circling whales, one big fluke in the air, lots of gulls swirling over. -Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We saw around <b>8 orcas heading south in Admiralty Inlet</b> about a half mile south of <b>Bush Point at 0950</b>. -Brian McLaughlin, Shellfish Biologist, WDFW

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Unidentified killer whales - March 29 - <b>6:45 p.m. - At least 3 maybe 4 orcas just passed Lagoon Point</b> (Admiralty Inlet). Heading North. One large female 2 or 3 much smaller. They were traveling. -Merilyn Ohlson

Hi we have been watching several <b>(at least 6) Orca traveling south from Boiler Bay in Depoe Bay, Oregon</b>.  We drove south to Otter Loop Rd just south of Rocky Creek in Depoe Bay and are still watching them travel south. We spotted them at <b>6:30 pm </b>March 28th and are still watching them now at 7:07 pm.  Last sighting was at <b>7:30 pm</b>.

Sperm whale - March 27 - Not sure what they saw off Lummi but we had <b>a sperm whale off Nanaimo</b> today. Same individual that Jared had in Johnstone Strait a couple of weeks ago. Got ID photos and recordings. Last seen heading NE off Pipers Lagoon just before dark. 
Spotted the sperm whale from shore <b>off north Nanaimo around noon</b>.  We (John Ford, Brianna Wright, and Eva Stredulinsky) encountered him a couple of hours later off the entrance to Departure Bay heading south. He proceeded down Northumberland Channel off the west side of Gabriola Island, diving for 30-40 minutes between periods at the surface. He turned back before <b>going through Dodd Narrows</b> at the bottom of Northumberland Channel, and was last seen just <b>west of Departure Bay at dusk</b>. This is the same whale that Jared Towers and the folks at OrcaLab observed and recorded in Johnstone Strait from mid February to March 18 - he was given the name Yukusam up there. -Best, John Ford, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada

March 27 - North Saratoga Passage - I caught a few pictures of the whales having fun in <b>Utsalady Bay</b> today, these were the best I could get from about a mile away ... looking northwest from Arrowhead point with Whidbey Island in the background.  Are these <b>gray whales</b>, they look small to me...thanks so much....Basically, it looked to me they were going down to the bottom (its shallow in Utsalady bay) then the would come back up approx every 1-2 minutes and not in the same location they went down and 'spout' then we would see their black shark like fin raise to the surface but it would rise and fall (up/down) rather than roll and I never saw the classic tails. I understand that grays have butterfly shaped spouts and these seemed to blow more upwards but the wind is blowing around 10mph.  I saw two of these one was further south of us in the sunshine so unable to get a good pic, he/she was due west between us and Poinell Point. <b>Gray whale on her/his side feeding in Utsalady Bay, Camano Island. </b>-All the best, Phil Kezele

March 25 (<b>possible sperm whale</b>) - We had a message from Nickolaus Dee Lewis of Lummi; two Lummi fisherman saw a whale they thought <b>may have been a sperm whale as it had a bulbous head</b> - it surfaced close to their boat and seemed to hover, they said it stuck its head out of the water for awhile - then it went back under and they didn't see it again, they were concerned by its behavior that it might be hurt or sick. This was late afternoon/early evening off Carter Pt, So. end of Lummi. 
(more of original report below along with Jared Towers reply)
<br/>  
"One of my buddies (Randingo Kinley) just called me and told me they seen a sperm whale or fin whale that appeared to be hurt somehow, wasn't acting normal. Was off Carter Point off south end of Lummi island they may have got the whale description wrong, but said it was a large whale and just how it appeared they did try waiting for it after noticing it, but it didn't come back up after they noticed it, and slowed down to look more at it. Just wanted to send it as a FYI case get any other reports." 
<br/>
Thanks for this Susan and Howie. The sperm whale we had in Johnstone Strait was detected acoustically and or visually almost every day between February 11th and March 18th. Since the 18th there has been no sign of him. Based on comparisons with boat size as well as body measurements estimated from acoustic recordings he was about 45 feet long. His surface and dive behaviour was quite normal and his body condition appeared healthy from photographs and underwater video. Given his long dives, short surfacing intervals and active acoustic behaviour, the best way to confirm if he is around is probably acoustically. I'll be interested to hear if his presence down there can be verified. -Jared Towers, DFO

March 25 - South Saratoga/Possession Sound - We were fortunate with weather today, chilly, but beautifully calm water in Possession Sound as we took off in search of gray whales. Soon after leaving Langley we found<b> #531 feeding on the north east side of Hat (Gedney) Island</b>, showing her fluke on shallow dives. A little further to the south we found two more whales, the iconic <b>#49 Patch traveling with #53 Little Patch</b> - fun to see them together as they also fluked on several shallow dives. We were fortunate to have Elliott Menashe from Greenbelt Consulting on board today - educating us on land-slides on both Whidbey and Camano Islands as we viewed them from Mystic Sea. An interesting day for sure. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Hello, On Sunday,...I was sitting on a bench in <b>Hibulb Park, Everett </b>(Legion Park), with a pair of great binoculars. Starting at around <b>2:30 PM </b>for about 30 min, I could observe blows from three whales between Everett and Clinton, closer to the Whidbey. ...there were spouts from another <b>three or four whales </b>closer to me and in front of <b>Jetty Island</b>. I saw a lot of fluke or fin action... I am very excited to have found Orca Network, read the reports every day, and would like to learn more about it. -Thank you, Barbara Inge Karsch

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

She was the only whale. We saw her right after high tide, so probably from <b>11:30 to about 12:30</b>. First spotted her closer to Whidbey and watched her make her way over to <b>Mabana</b>. I believe it is the same (re; pec photo - alb). This was taken right off the county road where people launch their boats. Think there used to be a dock there long ago.<b> #22 Earhart</b> -Ronda Miller

Unidentified cetacean - March 25 - Admiralty Inlet - Possible orca (but more <b>likely minke</b> or a really big Dall's) mid crossing on the <b>11:00 am Port Townsend/Keystone ferry crossing</b>. I saw the back and heard the blow two times and did not see a large dorsal. I'm pretty familiar with the whales of our area. It was one animal and headed towards PT. Some folks on the ferry said orca but I did not see a dorsal, certainly not a large one. It was definitely bigger than a porpoise. Not a gray. Minke or orca. Too large to be Harbor porpoise. Possible juvenile minke and certain it was alone. Down time ~ 2-3 minutes when we saw it. -Andrea Vance

Welcome back Sounder<b> #22 (Earhart)</b>, who survived a boat strike last year. Is it any wonder that #22 is named after Amelia Earhart for her pioneering feeding technique? Today we witnessed that first-hand as #22 exhibited the highly specialized (and strategically risky) behavior of feeding close to shore in shallow water, with her pectoral fin and partial 10-12 foot long flukes exposed above the surface as she dug deep in the sediment for crustaceans south of Sandy Point, near Langley. After leaving Earhart we spent some time with #383 between Whidbey and Hat Island, before joining <b>#49 (Patch) and #53 (Little Patch) south of Hat Island</b>. And that wasn't the end of it... We spotted another whale, possibly <b>#21 or newcomer CRC-185 heading towards Everett </b>while stopping along the way to check out ghost-shrimp buffet. So much action in a relatively small space and short time-frame with these magnificent giants who choose to visit us every spring. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photos Richard Snowberger, Crew)

It was nice to see the sun again today! It was still a bit chilly in the morning, but with the help of some hot cider (thanks Michael), I stayed out on the bow of the San Juan Clipper to get a good look at some of our Sounders. The first whale we spotted was <b>#22 Earhart</b> feeding just south of <b>Langley</b> in shallow water along the shore of Whidbey Island. We got really good looks at her pectoral fins and flukes as she rolled to feed close to the beach! We also caught up with <b>#21 Shackleton</b> a little further north. Later, on our way back to Seattle, we encountered #531 as she crossed Saratoga Passage to Camano Head. She fluked several times giving us some nice looks at her unique scarring patterns. -Justine Buckmaster

<b>Southern Residents -</b> In mid-day whales were reported inbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca somewhere near Race rocks, very spread out and taking long dives. Hoping they might be J pod returning, Ken set out in Chimo and headed toward Seabird Point, Discovery Island where they were reportedly heading. However, the whales stalled out near the end of an ebbing tide and were foraging toward William Head on the south Vancouver Island coast. The dives were long, the whales very spread over at least ten square miles, and the situation was at first backlit; but,<b> they were J pod</b>!...Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 19.

It was impossible to count them but there<b> must have been dozens</b>. -Photo by Mary Jo Adams, March 21, 2018

March 20 - Possession Sound - <b>6:45 p.m. - NE Hat Island there are 2 whales</b>, continued feeding until 8:00+ After-dinner visit by one of the returning gray whale "Sounders" right in front of the house! Incredibly blessed. The FB VIDEO shows their feeding behavior-rolling in the shallows to kick up the ghost shrimp.

<b>Depoe Bay, Oregon -</b> Carrie Newell called in a report of <b>L pod orcas off Depoe Bay on March 19 &amp; 20</b>:
Monday the 19th they saw <b>20 - 25 whales</b>, 3 open saddles, 3 males, 2 calves (one juvenile and one very small calf), right <b>off Depoe bay by the bell buoy, heading south</b>. She then sent this report: 
<br/>Met them just south of the Depoe Bay buoys in 80 feet of water traveling south at 5 knots. 4 minute dive cycles with 1-2 minutes at surface. Met them on 3-19-2018 at 12:40pm and left them around 2pm just south of Cape Foulweather. N 44 47 640 and W 124 05 044 there were 4-5 males and 2 calves. Assumed L pod from San Juans. Initially doing abreast behavior but 45 minutes later spread out in small groups separated by as much as 1/4 mile. On <b>3-20-2018 my other captains encountered 5 orcas traveling south</b> at 5 knots in 60 feet of water. 4 females and one adult male. Noon encounter. - Carrie Newell - Whale Research EcoExcursions (Depoe Bay, Oregon)

March 19 - <b>Spieden Channel</b> - Today I went out on the boat for the first time in nearly a year. First, we came across an eagle enjoying a snack. Then we caught up with the <b>T2Cs</b> heading north along <b>Spieden Island. Tumbo</b> was lagging behind, but the family would pause at times to let him catch him up. Eventually they launched an attack on a harbor seal. Tumbo sat just a short ways off, simply watching his family hunt. He'd surface every so often in the same exact spot and log at the surface, never taking his eyes off his family working without him to make the kill. When the hunt was over, Tumbo headed over to his family to join in on the feast. Afterwards they continued north and we headed home. A beautiful day with a special family of whales, who demonstrate care and compassion for their disabled family member. It's a beautiful thing, <b>T2C1 Rocky. T2C2 Tumbo</b>. -Rachel Haight

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

While we were out doing some work with the new Western Explorer II, we decided to have a look at the <b>T2Cs</b> family group of Bigg's Killer whales that were nearby. As we arrived, a hunt on a Steller Sea lion began. Shortly after, something interesting happened. <b>20+ Steller Sea lions came to the hunted one's defense</b>. They grouped up together watching for the Killer whales, and when they were close enough to the singeled out one, that animal made a break for it swimming at high speed until he got into the raft of sea lions. It was facinating to watch. The orcas swam around the scene for a little while, before turning and heading away from the scene. -Facebook video by Traci Walter HERE.

On the morning of March 18th word came in of <b>lots of whales southbound in the Strait of Georgia. J-Pod</b> had been up north for over a week; could this be them finally coming back down? Luckily for me there was still space available for Maya's Legacytrip out that afternoon to go and see! We headed north in nice calm waters to Boundary Pass, and it didn't take us long to spot our first fin: <b>J27 Blackberry. J16 Slick and J50 Scarlet in Boundary Pass.

This morning at <b>9am, two tight pods</b> came in the same way as ten days ago: closer to shore, heading East toward Saturna - in the middle of the Strait of Georgia. Here are the photos. Can you recognize them?  Some are standing.  I am very impressed by the super tight family formation in one group (where you see one pod...I thought there were <b>8 in one pod and 3-4 in the other</b> (which was further and more in front). -Yves Tiberghien (Mayne island, BC, Straight of Georgia)

They just headed out at <b>five pm</b>...past the lighthouse left with a tail slap like they were saying goodbye. They were amazingly close to shore! They were on the PT side for several hours - we first spotted them in front of us at <b>Point Hudson</b>. They followed the shoreline and passed just below us at the Science Center pier. Then followed the beach around at Fort Worden, and headed out at the lighthouse. They were logging and feeding north of the orange ferry bouy for quite some time. -Tammy Shelton

March 18 - <b>Port Susan - 3:50 p.m. - 2 Grays</b> near Camano right now....Watching from the dock at Kayak Point. Almost appear to be feeding on Camano. To far to tell. No mistake in the heart shapeblows. -Nate Trujillo

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

...it probably indeed was just<b> 2 big, 1 medium, and 2 or 3 juvenile grays</b>....they were a good two miles west of me, in the middle of the bay, maybe a little <b>closer to Camano Island than to Warm Beach</b>...
<b>Between 2 and 2:30 PM</b> today...a group of three very large cetaceans with several smaller ones, at least two and possibly three of which I believe were their young, some of which I believe were harbor porpoises careening around them, spouting and milling around in the middle of the <b>relatively shallow Susan Bay (Port Susan), between Warm Beach (where I live) and Camano Island.</b>
<br/>The big ones never rose very high above the surface, and I never saw a fluke or dorsal fin. They spouted huge spouts at irregular intervals of a minute or so. At one point, all three large ones breached the surface simultaneously, swimming north to south in formation at high speed, something I've never seen gray whales do (I have seen the winter gray whale migration along the Oregon coast several times), traveling from right to left in my field of view, and I got a clear look through the binoculars. 
<br/>The largest of the three was a good 40 feet from the spout to a point on the back somewhere forward of the dorsal fin at the point where it fully finished submerging after 2-3 seconds with its back just barely out of water--that is, I never saw the dorsal fin, but there was at least 40 feet of back behind the spout before the dorsal fin, and the whale had resubmerged before the dorsal fin could emerge, this while swimming at high speed. Again, I never saw any of their flukes. -Philip Courier

Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research notes on Kristen Adamanson video (originally reported as orcas): "It's impossible to tell from the video what dolphin species it is. The bodies look like they are too slender to be killer whales, but it <b>could be bottlenose, common, or Pacific white-sided dolphins</b>. Given the proximity to the Elliot Bay sighting, there is a <b>good chance these are the bottlenose dolphins</b>."

March 18 - (<i>Reported as Dall's porpoise but description fits Harbor porpoise - alb</i>)
<br/>Hi! My friend and I just drove over the <b>Hood Canal Bridge</b> and spotted <b>at least 7-8 porpoises</b>. We weren't able to get any photos. We also think they may have been feeding. There were many present in the same area and the water was pretty turbulent where they were, but glassy in other areas....We had thought Dall's because the dorsal fins were short and pointy, almost like a perfect triangle. Not much curve to them, and very small. They were black or very, very dark gray. -Allie Stote

ID notes by Dave Anderson Cascadia Research: "Dave Glenn sent me the rest of his photos. While none of them were clear enough on their own for an ID, there are enough hints between them to suggest that <b>this animal could be Stump</b>. One of the images, when really zoomed in, shows probable nicks in about the right places, and another one from head on shows the bend in the dorsal fin. Thanks to Dave and the Seattle Aquarium!" -Photo by Dave Glenn, March 17, 2018

Photos of the <b>gray whale who was not a Sounder</b> observed today <b>off Hat Island (along with known Sounders)</b> were sent to Cascadia Research. Turns out it is a known individual from the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG): "Alie recognized this whale right away as one of our PCFG regulars, <b>CRC-185</b>. Well over 200 sightings of this whale going back to 1996 with most sightings being off S Vancouver Island. Unusual for it to be in this area and will be interesting to see if it sticks around." - John Calambokidis

March 16 - We saw (pretty sure transients) in <b>Burrows Pass of Fidalgo Island</b>. There were 4-5 with a fairly young calf. The pics aren't great (my camera settings were off), but may be able to ID. They only came in for a few minutes, moved up against the kelp on Fidalgo Island a bit, then went back out into the Strait.

March 13 - Haro Strait - ...in the rain, we were surprised to find whales <b>mid-Haro Strait off the north end of Land Bank at about 1700</b>. The whales were the <b>T2Cs, T46s, and T137s</b> and they had all been reported previously to be among the whales at Middle Bank. The whale watch boat "J1", who had been waiting for us to make sure we got on whales, still had other Ts down south of us in the gloom.
We stuck with the northern groups who had been altogether when we first got on scene before the T2Cs split off and were traveling north fast about a quarter mile ahead of the T46s and T137s. T2C2 was not present with the T2Cs and it was not known how far behind the others he was. -Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 15.

March 13 - San Juan Channel - The amount of Bigg's Killer whales in the last few days is incredible!! They seem to like coming in during spring to form social groups. Around here, we call that a "T-party". T for Transient Killer whale, though we use "Bigg's" and "transient" interchangeably as both refer to the fact that these are mammal-eating Killer whales. This the <b>T18's</b>. I became aware of them <b>outside Friday Harbor about 2pm</b>. They worked their way north in San Juan Channel for a portion of the day before heading off to the northeast. A group I just love spending time with. It was really nice to see them today. Hopefully, they enjoy some social time with the other groups and stick around! -Traci Walter

March 13 - We saw <b>about 5 orcas in Discovery Bay</b>! And quite aways down the bay. We live off Holland Rd, 300 ft up, but could see them in the water. There were spoutings, breaching, diving and two big jumps out of the water. They were there for about 30 minutes (it was around 1pm) and then started heading north....Feeding, circling, a couple of jumps, swimming. 48°00'33.8"N 122°51'13.3"W The above is an estimated location, projecting from our house. What a special 'show' we'll never forget! -Mary &amp; Paul Hootman

At <b>1310, J19 and J39 were found 4 miles north of Porlier Pass, east of Valdez Island in Georgia Strait</b>. The two were spread out and slowly traveling southbound. A few whales were visible far to the east, so "Morning Star" slowly worked its way in that direction.
Twenty minutes later, <b>J41 and J51</b> were located. The pair was foraging together and after a bit of milling, a salmon was rammed out of the water by J41. -Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 14.

March 11 - <b>San Juan Channel - 5:27 p.m. </b>- Checking out the San Juan Islands for some boat in camping and hiking yesterday and found this amazing family of Orcas along the way. They were very far when we saw them, cut the engine and waited. The new born was very curious and ended up going under and around the boat several times with his momma looking at us. It was breathtaking as the male ushered them off. Pod of<b> 6 or 7 all together</b>. -Misty Burns Emery

For a brief moment in the sun-dappled waters at the mouth of Friday Harbor mother and son paused, side by side at the surface. I found myself wondering at what the moment held between the two of them, but only a small part of me because the moment belonged to them and only them. <b>Tasu (T002C) and Tumbo (T002C2)</b>. First time seeing whales from Reuben Tarte and what an amazing encounter it was...Here's Tumbo (T002C2) and his mom, Tasu (T002C) and older brother, Rocky (T002C1).

The <b>T002Cs </b>milling and killing for over an hour back and forth. Truly an amazing morning. Check out <b>T2C2</b>!! I thought he had a chunk of seal, but turns out that seal chunk had legs!!! Some kind of seabird, perhaps a common murre? I watched him actually suck it into his mouth before he went underwater, so not sure what happened after that.

March 11 - Another glorious day with California grays... <b>Patch #49, Little Patch #53 and #383 graced the shores off Camano Head </b>as they made their way south slowly but surely toward Hat Island in the warm afternoon sunshine. They were not the only Californian visitors - three curious California sea-lions couldn't resist a good look around, and a pair of watchful bald eagles perched on pilings didn't miss a trick.

March 10 - (Opening Day!): We left Langley Marina on a beautiful, sunny morning, motoring out on glass smooth water, heading east toward Tulalip, with reports of a few of our "Sounders" gray whales in the area. We turned south toward the Snohomish River estuary, near Everett, and found <b>#49 Patch and #53 Little Patch, as well as a third, unidentified whale.</b> They were heading up into the estuary, which is quite shallow, so we briefly watched them do a little side fluke foraging. We then circumvented Gedney Island, and came back around as the tide came out, bringing the whales into deeper water. We got very good looks at these two whales' identifying marks, and finally (!) a nice fluke up dive by Little Patch. A great day and a great start for our whale watching season! -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist

...He headed over to CWR where he and Ken watched the whales, who looked like the <b>T2Cs</b>, through the scopes as they rounded Bellevue Point. Dave then left for Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after <b>1700</b>. The boat got on scene about ten minutes later to find the <b>T2Cs milling off Low Island</b>. The whales took about a ten minute long dive before coming up right at Sunset Point...Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 12.

<b>Bottlenose dolphin -</b> March 9 - Saw this dolphin at <b>Point Ruston</b>. Wondering what it is.  We first saw it around <b>2pm</b> just outside of the Point Ruston development. It was going towards the Port of Tacoma, and we followed it as far as Cummings Park, till about <b>3pm</b>. Later, back at Point Ruston, we saw it there again around <b>6pm</b>. -Wayne Lattuca
<br/>(<i>"It is definitely a bottlenose and is NOT Miss... The new photos show a really distinctive bent dorsal fin, so it should make confirmation easier." -  Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research</i>).

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:47 p.m. - Dolphin in Commencement Bay, heading west into Dalco Passage</b>. Definitely dolphin, dorsal shape consistent with Pacific white sided dolphin, but appeared very dark, couldn't see the shading to white... has a definite hook to the dorsal fin. It was dark in color. -Travis Goldman
<br/><i>Notes from Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research who reviewed Travis Goldman's photos (before we received Wayne's photo confirming bottlenose): 
<br/>"We haven't had any reports of the bottlenose for several months. They did seem to like the area between Commencement Bay and Alki Point, so it is in the right area. The dorsal fin is the right shape for bottlenose, and the one picture with more of the body showing looks right for a bottlenose as well, but it would be really hard to say for sure. It doesn't look right for a common dolphin. We still don't have any good ID shots for any bottlenose other than Miss.
<br/>The common dolphins that have been seen in the South Sound for the last couple years were recently seen near McNeil Island, so they are still around.  Before that, there haven't been any reports since the fall. We haven't personally seen them since late summer, even though we try and make it out on the water at least once each month."</i>

<b>Southern Residents - One or more orca pods came at 3 different times today in the Strait of Georgia, off Edith Point on Mayne island</b>.
<br/>Encounter 3: This is the third sighting <b>between 519pm and 525pm</b> tonight. There must be <b>at least 4 Orcas</b>, but possibly more. They are going South toward Satura, maybe 1 km from shore or more.
<br/>Encounter 2: <b>Orcas seen further inside Georgia Strait, several miles out of Mayne island</b> with Point Roberts in the back <b>between 411pm and 416pm</b> today. They were mostly going South but some photos show them going North. So maybe they went back and forth? Are they the same as those I took at 520pm an hour later? (closer to shore by then) One middle photo shows 5 orcas on the same photo. So there are at least 5 of them! I am curious to hear more about who they are!
<br/>Encounter 1: ...first morning sighting. Maybe it is a different pod from the ones in the afternoon. They seemed to pop up over a wide area, ie <b>at least 4-5 individuals</b>. Heading south as well. No boats around, as for all subsequent visits later today. -Yves Tiberghien (Mayne island, BC)
<br/><i>"L87, J17, and J53 are the only ones I can say are there with any certainty.  There is a whale in the pics who is probably J38.  I also see a couple other males that might be J27 and K26.

March 7 - <b>San Juan Channel - T2Cs - We got a visit from the T2Cs</b> this afternoon! They're such an amazing family group, with 16 year-old male <b>T2C2 having scoliosis</b> but likely surviving thanks to his supportive family. Here he is surfacing on the left with his youngest sibling <b>T2C4</b> first seen in early 2017. The family of 5 were heading slowly south off Reuben Tarte County Park late this afternoon. Here's another photo that shows the deformed spine and twisted dorsal fin a bit more. It can be hard to capture in a photo but is very visible when you see him surface. T2C2 swims very slowly and his family seems to slow down to accommodate him. Because of his physical deformity he's unlikely to be an efficient hunter; killer whales are known to prey share, especially with family, so the fact that he's lived this long likely means his family members are hunting and sharing food with him. On several occasions I've witnessed him hanging back while his family hunts, then he moves in when they've made the kill. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, March 7, 2018

March 5 - Eastern Juan de Fuca/Admiralty Inlet - <b>around 12:15 pm- We saw a grey whale off Ebey's Landing beach</b>, Whidbey Island, about 50-yards offshore. It appeared to be a small whale - perhaps 15' of surface was visible when it surfaced. It was alone. We scanned the area with binoculars but didn't see any other whales nearby. The location was where the northern end of the hiking trail comes down the hillside to reach the beach. We watched the whale for about 15-minutes, and it moved in about a 100-yard area, surfacing occasionally...The fact that the grey whales present only part of their body is very interesting. That was our experience as we didn't see a head (or eye) or tail at all. The 'blow' was perhaps 10' high, not very tall. It was moving n/nw  but not at any speed, more it was covering an area about 100-yards across, it seemed. The tide was ebbing. We didn't take photos, I'm sorry. The whale had a mottled grey, green, white-spotted surface color...-Bron Richards

...At <b>0745</b>, Dave spotted <b>blows in Swanson Channel. Nearly all of J pod </b>was traveling in two tight groups off of Stanley Point on North Pender Island. The <b>lead group was made up of the J16s and J17s. The trailing group was made up of the J14s, J22s, J27, J31, and J46. K21 was further out in the channel</b> and paralleling the two groups by a few hundred yards...Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 11.

The stars aligned yesterday and we were able to get out and spend some time with the endangered southern resident killer whales! They were very <b>spread across the Strait of Georgia but it looked like all of J Pod </b>was present and possibly K Pod members but no positive ID's on those. For sure, we had <b>J16, J50, J37, J49, J26, L87, J38 and J22</b> in this photo doing an inverted tail slap! -Photo by Gary Sutton, Ocean Ecoventures, March 4, 2018

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - <b>Transient Orcas at Point Roberts, WA</b>. Today around <b>4pm</b> there were <b>at least 4 orcas off shore viewed from Point Roberts Lighthouse Park </b>heading up the Strait towards Deltaport BC. They were transients and were hunting poroises - twice we saw a porpoise tossed high in the air by a whale. One whale had a larger dorsal fin than the others. They moved quite quickly past the Point then circled around an area offshore where we had earlier seen porpoises. The orcas were blowing and surfacing frequently. Very dramatic. We watched for about 20 mins. -Anne Murray

March 3 - Unidentified <b>4th gray off Snohomish Delta - 5:19 p.m</b>. - Just saw a blow! We are at Legion Park looking straight out into the flats toward Camano (directionally) -through binoculars. We are looking west northwest north end of Jetty Island flats. First sighting of the season (not on our boat). We have seen multiple blows-we think they are feeding in the flats. Too far for phone photos but very cool! Harley thinks there is just one, but I'm not sure. -Sharon Clark

The grays are here in numbers...it was a beautiful day out there watching them travel all snugged up together. Here are <b>gray whales 53, 56, &amp; 723 while southbound in Possession Sound from just south of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes</b> to just north of Possession Point. There were times I thought I was seeing three, and turns out all three were there. Confused as there turned out to be a 4th up near Everett.
<br/><b>3:33 p.m. - these beauties (grays) have rounded Possession Point</b> and are currently on the south side of it hugging Whidbey side, heading west.
<br/><b>2:55 p.m. - these looks like 3 grays </b>are maintaining steady <b>southbound</b>, still west of mid channel. <b>Approaching Possession Point</b>. They are sticking close together, often surfacing in tandem.
<br/><b>1:50 p.m. - 2 grays still steady southbound west of mid channel at about Glendale, Whidbey</b>. Viewing from Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach.

<b>North Puget Sound grays</b> have arrived! "We were so excited to watch them with the setting sun behind their blows! The first two were taken while they appeared to be <b>feeding just west of Langley</b>." -Photo by Peg Boley, March 1, 2018

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

March 1 - Saratoga Passage - At<b> 5:15 pm</b> today, we had our first sighting of <b>grey whales (we think there were two</b>, because they blew the same time) in front of Langley. We could easily see them from<b> Pebble Beach on Camano</b>. They seemed to be feeding just NW of the town, then moved out into Saratoga Passage. Feeding just <b>NW of Langley, then moving SE towards Hat Island</b>. Watched them for about 30 minutes.  At first they seem to be feeding just NW of the town of Langley. When two boats passed, they moved off, towards Hat Island not coming up as often...the whales (we were aware of two blows at one point, but the photos look like just one) moved away from Langley towards Hat Island. What a thrill - the water was so calm, and their blows were so loud. -Peg Boley

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:27 p.m. -</b> Currently we see spouting in <b>Saratoga Passage at Mabana Beach</b> area. The sun was in our eyes,no photos. Lots of big spouts You could barely see the whale from time to time. We could see the wake it left as it moved closer to Camano and south. With the sun in our eyes like that we can only guess that it was a grey whale slowly feeding as it went along. -Susanne Almberg

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:00 p.m. - At least two smaller whales traveling close to the surface going south through Saratoga Passage</b>. They were first observed from Camano near mid channel<b> off of Mabana</b> and last seen just south of Langley. Observed blowing at regular intervals for over an hour. They appeared to be slowly traveling south at a shallow depth. Even when not breaking the water it was possible to follow them through their wake on the calm surface. -Bob Anderson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:30 p.m. - Gray whale Saratoga Passae off Hidden Beach</b> southbound. 14-16 minute down times 2 short breaths. Unable to ID. (possibly 1 of the 2 reported off Glendale this morning) -Eric Rosemore, Mystic Sea

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

March 1 - <b>Possesssion Sound - 3:00 pm.</b> - S/he was feeding off their until I left around 3pm!
<br/><b>2:15 p.m. -  Gray whale is still in same general area off Jetty Island</b> in general out from north end of the Everett Marina. Cruising back and forth rolling around engaged in typical feeding behavior. Gulls and other seabirds swooping in feeding as well. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:00 p.m. - 1 grey Whale</b> still in delta feeding. (<b>Snohomish Delta</b>). -Carl Williams

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:05 p.m. -</b> First of the returning grays that we could with confidence say was one of the North Puget Sounders due to location and feeding behavior. This whale fed off the Snohomish Delta all morning and well into the afternoon. I can confirm this gray whale is rolling in the mudflats off<b> Jetty Island</b>, presumably feeding on shrimp buried in the sand...a technique we know the "Sounders" have perfected. Been watching this behavior for the past 30 minutes. And her/his blows look very robust! Viewing from Legion Park in Everett.
<br/><b>11:20 a.m -  Gray moved out from Jetty Island</b> maybe 1/2 mile westbound movement, but may just be circling around. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:49 a.m. -</b> Confirmed!! We can see the blow from <b>east side of Hat, just south of Tulalip</b>, near the sand bar marker. One individual heading north. -Lori Christopher

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:50 a.m. -</b> I can now confirm <b>blows off Jetty Island</b> about mid way up Jetty Island. The whales is just hanging in same area. Too far for IDs but is blow of big whale for sure! 
<br/><b>10:10 a.m - </b>Saw first blows not far <b>offshore of Jetty Island</b> about mid way up. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:02 a.m. -</b> Happy March 1st! I'm in the Everett Rucker Hill neighborhood and can see <b>whale blows (from one whale) between Hat and Jetty Island</b>, closer to Jetty than Hat. I'm a marine mammal biologist and knowing the area and time of year I suspect it's a gray whale however, the blow is not defined enough from my vantage point to say it's v-shaped or not. -Amy Willoughby

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:30 a.m - 2 grays around Glendale, Whidbey Island</b>. 3rd hand report from Eric, Mystic Sea relayed to him by Langley Harbor Master who heard from a boater this morning. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Jeannette Conover and her husband are caretakers of <b>Possession Point Park</b> and report seeing <b>a whale</b> (initially thinking orca) northbound <b>off Possession point towards Mukilteo/Clinton at 7:00 am</b>. After some discussion they believe it was a gray whale.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Unidentified whales - March 1 - North Puget Sound -<b> 12:00 Noon - From the ferry leaving Kingston I saw 3 blows </b>about a minute apart. Could not see any signs indicating what kind of whale. (No view of dorsal, fluke, back) Closer to Kingston side, north of ferry lane, unable to determine direction of travel. -Connie Bickerton
