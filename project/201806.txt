June 30 - Puget Sound - <b>1449: The T124As</b> were milling after a kill but never northbound. They're still southbound, south of Point No Point now at <b>Apple Tree Point</b>. We are with them again now. -Renee Beitzel 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

After hanging N around <b>Foulweather Bluff</b> for quite awhile, accompanied by 1-2 WW boats, Two groups suddenly came S between <b>12-12:40 pm</b>. All were SB with at least 4 in the lead group that torpedoed around the point well ahead of the WW boats, followed by group of 3 including young one that paused on a kill on N side of Lighthouse before continuing around the point SB. PSE boat was with that group. Both groups passed 75-100 yards off PNP. I'll post a few pics and one shaky video. Blood in the water from trailing group's kill N of Lighthouse. Group included a young one. Did not see what they got, but there were quite a few harbor porpoises right in that zone. Harbor seals were on shore and hugging shore as well. -Donna Van Renselaar

June 30 - ...after spending some time with the<b> T065As in Sansum Narrows</b>, we decided to go north a look for a big group of Biggs that had been seen up there earlier. We found them out in the<b> Strait of Georgia</b> and what a good decision it turned out to be!! Awesome watching the <b>T049As, T036As, T099s, T175 and T176s</b> socializing and circling around in the same spot as the sun started to set. -Gary Sutton

Was out with the Puget Sound Express out of Edmonds (aboard 2:30 departure)  and we had a pod of <b>6-7 transients just north of Kingston</b>. We kept with them for a bit before following a <b>humpback in the same area</b>. We met back up with the same pod just outside of Port Madison where they had just made a kill which appeared to be a harbor seal. Lots of spyhopping, tail lobbing, and a few breaches and backflips by the youngsters. Hunting, feeding, and playing. -Alex Polk

It was very large and it was on the surface for a short time, and at first we thought it was a log. Then it sounded and then came back up.

Orca sighting from S. shore of Saturna. Background: Initially sited Harbour porpoise about 7pm; unusual since in very close to cottage, Followed, about 5 min later, by single orca; also unusual since orca was solo. Looked like orca (reported as transient, was residents) was pursuing porpoise. Followed much later (in excess of 20 min) with remaining pod members (4-6 in number) with two shown. Interesting since extremely wide gap between first orca and the followers. Perhaps points out the hunting capabilities of the orcas. Outcome of hunt unknown, but there were 2 whale-watching boats located off Monarch Head which could view subsequent activity. I would appreciate any info as to the id of the pod. J16 Slick and her daughter J50 Scarlet off Saturna Island. -Regards, James McLarnon, Vancouver

While we were with the transients in Encounter 41, we heard over the radio that <b>J and L pods had been found farther north off the Fraser</b> river mouth heading south....We got on scene with Js and Ls at <b>1640</b> a little over halfway <b>between Pt. Roberts and Patos Island</b>. The whales were very spread out and foraging on their way south towards Boundary Pass. We first saw <b>J35 and J47</b> to the west of most of the others and the pair was loosely spread and seemed to foraging...-Full encounter summary and photos at Center for Whale Research #42.

June 28 - <b>Killer whales spotted in Burrard Inlet</b> - Researchers with the Vancouver Aquarium's Ocean Wise research team spotted killer whales in Burrard Inlet earlier today. "The last report we received was of the whales near Spanish Banks, so, although we can't predict their path, it sounds like they briefly came into Burrard Inlet and then headed out again," says aquarium spokesperson Deanna Lancaster. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 28 - ...There was a large group of transients, including<b> T175-a</b> rare visitor to the Salish Sea, found north of East Point heading north...Along with <b>T65A2</b>, this turned out to be <b>T176</b>, plus a large juvenile/subadult that is probably <b>T176A</b>, and a small juvenile of T176's. This recent visit (6/27-6/29) by the T176s is the first time, to our knowledge, that this matriline has been documented in the inside waters around southern Vancouver Island. - See full encounter with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 41.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:00 a.m - </b>Large whale heading north past <b>Steilacoom</b> right now. I'm thinking <b>humpback</b>, no tail view. Was cool, was laying in bed and just happened to look outside and there it was. I took video, but so far away. -Lisa Wiksten

...<b>J26</b> had been reported to be trailing the leaders but was well ahead of the trailing groups and we found him <b>mid-Haro Strait</b> at <b>1330</b>. J26 was traveling fast due north toward Land Bank. After a quick look at him, we moved ahead in the direction he was heading to see if we could find the rest of the J16s. We found the <b>J19s and J50</b> spread out near Edwards Point heading south. J26 appeared several hundred yards down island of the others and was now also heading slowly south....-See full report summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 40.

<b>16:46 - </b>A friend is seeing some near <b>False Bay</b>. 
<br/>As of <b>14:45</b> all were still <b>south of Lime Kiln</b>... The ones that made it within sight were traveling south, the big group that came across looked like they must have hit at Eagle or around there. 
<br/><b>13:45 - </b>seeing whales <b>mid Haro </b>aiming straight at Lime Kiln, no boats with them 
<br/><b>13:00 - Leaders approaching Discovery</b> now per AIS. We've heard <b>Js and Ls</b> mentioned so far.

It surfaced twice, but was rapidly moving north west towards Point Defiance. I studied humpbacks in college, so I was able to identify that it surely was a humpback. So exciting!

6/24 Trip Report: Another spectacular day! First we saw some fat harbor seals, then caught up with the <b>T137</b> family very quickly, just past <b>Fidalgo Head</b> south of Allen Island. We followed them <b>under the Deception Pass Bridge</b>, and watched as they made a kill on the north side of Strawberry Island. And then they attempted to go back out under the bridge, but against a very strong tide! They were going full power, with lunges and huge exhalations, but at one point were actually being pushed backwards! They finally made it, and headed southwest into the fog. We headed out to find a humpback at Colville Island, and followed him/her through alternating sun and fog east, and lost him/her in the fog at Burrows Island.
<br/><b>12:50 p.m. -</b> Just received word the <b>T137s</b> are in and around Deception Pass. The family had east under the bridge earlier made a kill around Strawberry Island (east of Deception Pass bridge) and then headed back out west under the bridge but were being pushed back by the currents.  -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Coastal killer whales - June 24 - We received a call today from Corey McCaughlin, reporting a sighting of<b> two orcas </b>Sunday June 24th off <b>Gleneden Beach, OR </b>(south of Lincoln City and Siletz River).

June 23 - <b>Boundary Pass - T49As &amp; T65As</b> - After spending some time up north with the <b>T124As in Active Pass</b> we headed back south where the <b>T49As, T65As and T137s</b> were traveling together around the San Juans. By the time we got with them approx. 12:20 the T137s had split off and headed south and the T49As and T65As were heading eastbound in Boundary Pass on the US side, <b>north side of Waldron Island off Sandy Point</b>. These families were beautifully grouped and pretty much were just traveling at a good pace and continued that way for the ~ 25 minutes we were with them. At some point they zig-zagged north and then back east again... we last saw these families heading northeasterly near<b> north side of Skipjack Island about 12:45</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks (w/Gayle Swigart)

June 23 -<b> Enterprise Reef through Active Pass - T124As &amp; T124A2s</b> - A friend and I headed north up to the Gulf Islands with Maya's Legacy aboard J1 in hopes of seeing whales in places we have never explored. Approx. 30 minutes off the dock we got word there were orcas at Enterprise Reef off the west side of Mayne Island, BC heading northbound. We arrived shortly after 11:00, watched them pass in front of the Mayne Island ferry and take a right into Active Pass. Once in the pass they zig- zagged, made several directional changes in some of the currents (initially we thought they were on a kill) then moved on traveling the pass grouped up at a steady pace. They cleared the pass about 30 minutes later where we watched this lovely family continue north in front of the Galiano Island ferry dock. We then we turned and headed back west through Active and headed south to Boundary Pass to spend some time with another group of orcas.

Another lovely day! We caught up with the <b>T65A family of Biggs/Transient</b> (meat-eating), along with a few <b>T49As</b> orcas just off <b>Lopez Island</b>, then followed them through Lopez Pass. They became extremely active, hunting a harbor seal, with massive and multiple tail slaps, lunging back and forth, and then some spy hops and breaches. After consuming the prey, they took some power naps. This family matriarch is T65A (born 1986), with her son <b>T65A2 (2004), and 4 other calves (A3-2007, A4-2011, A5-2014, and new baby A6-4/2018)</b>. They have been seen many times around the Salish Sea this season. As we left them to their rest, we motored out to Lawrence Reef, south west of Burrows Island, and found a humpack, reported to be BCY Unknown "Scratchy." Fabulous sunny summer day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Southern Residents - June 21 - Summer Solstice Orca Encounter no. 3! Sublime is the only way describe the gift of getting to sit in such a place as <b>Cattle Point and witness members of L pod</b> travel through the turbulent waters of Cattle Pass. The first sight of this group (ID'd as the <b>L4s, L47s, L72s, and L90</b> by Monika Wieland Shields) was their towering blows rising above the rocks at Cape San Juan to the north of the park at <b>5:31pm</b>. They continued in steady travel mode powering through the pass, back-dropped by lovely Lopez Island, went on the east side of Goose Island and exited the pass moving out of sight as they rounded the point under Cattle Point light house about 5:45 pm. We moved over to the bluffs east of the lighthouse and watched as they launched into series of non stop breaches! They continued to be very surface active while continuing SW for a while and then seemed to split up and stall out. They were offshore South Beach when we left at just before 6PM. 
This group of Ls came down from the north in the morning and chose San Juan Channel/Cattle Pass while <b>Js &amp; L87 chose the west side</b>. Heart happy first day of summer filled with sunshine, choppy seas, a whole lot of orcas, alongside a good friend.

Summer Solstice Orca Encounter no. 2! <b>J pod and L87 came down from the north</b> spread out many miles apart, passing <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse by early afternoon (first visible to the north from the lighthouse ~ 1:15pm</b>). Shortly before a family of <b>Bigg's (see T49As</b> video) swam northbound on course for the residents, they quickly turned around passing us again southbound approx 15 minutes ahead of the lead J pod members.<b> Js &amp; L87 </b>streamed past very spread out, powering south, at times porpoising in choppy seas with occasional breaches, tail lobs, and what was presumed to be salmon chasing (just after 1 minute mark in the video). Last of the Js passed us on the rocks around <b>2:07 pm</b>. A heartfelt Thursday solstice afternoon bathed in sunshine and howling winds, bare feet to the warm rocks and eyes on the beautiful, but struggling, endangered Southern Residents. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Just as we (Gayle Swigart &amp; I) were settling in on the rocks at <b>Lime Kiln </b>light to wait for southbound <b>Southern Resident orcas J pod &amp; L87</b> (salmon eating type), a family of<b> Bigg's/Transients the T49As</b> (mammal eating type) who were a surprise to everyone showed up a bit offshore heading northbound on course towards lead Js. The T49As passed us northbound at <b>12:47 pm</b>, and with little choice but to turn back passed us again at 1:03 pm this time southbound breathtakingly close, our bodies shaking &amp; hearts pounding in their wake. <b>J pod leaders were within sight by 1:19pm</b>. No one knew about or had reported this family of Ts so it was a great surprise to us when we pulled up in the parking lot, told a family there were orcas, and they responded with yes, orcas were at the south end of the park; a tad confused we wondered had more residents come in? had some lead Js snuck by? Once down on the rocks, we find Bob and those who conduct research each summer getting settled in as well and were just as surprised as us.  A sweet summer solstice bonus gift forever embedded in our beings. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

June 20 - We saw what I think we <b>SKRW whales around Turn Point</b> yesterday, based on their foraging behavoir. Here are two pics that hopefully you can identify (see below). There were 5 of them, I think. Might have been six. Definitely 3 large males and then a female with a younger one. Let me know who you think this is...Thanks! <b>J41 Eclipse - near Turn Point, Saturna Island. L87 Onyx a lovely fellow who travels with J pod. </b>-Mariann Carrasco

A BC Ferry passed close by, they shifted to mid channel then to entrance of Fulford Harbour, then finally headed west towards Saanich Inlet. they seemed to be fishing taking long dives (5-10 minutes). First sighting was between Portland and Piers Islands; about 1 nm off Portland and Brackman. A Gulf Islands BC ferry passed close by then they moved to mid channel and towards the entrance to Fulford Harbour, then continued west. A small number of boats (only 1 or 2 at a time) observed.

June 20 - Puget Sound - At about <b>11 pm </b>I am 99% sure I heard a whale as it went past our house, west shore of <b>Day Island</b>. It was definitely not a sea lion or seal. Couldn't see it but I heard it. <b>Maybe the humpbacks</b> going South? -Karen Caldwell

I was enjoying dinner at Anthony's at<b> Point Defiance</b> in Tacoma, and a spotted <b>a couple whales make their way across Commencement Bay</b> between the ferry Crossing of Point Defiance and Vashon Island and saw them surface a good 20 to 30 times over the course of 30 minutes. -Dale Seitz

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3 humpbacks in Commencement Bay</b>, Tacoma this evening. <b>6:30pm - 7:30pm.</b> Browns Point Light House to Jack Hyde Park, then in toward the port. They swam in and out of the Wednesday night sail boat races out of Tyee. Whales were all but touching each other as they would roll for air. Mellow pace. Long dives. Last sight of them was moving north/ east across mount of port, back toward NE Tacoma side. -Dean Burke

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~ 1830 - Sighted two grays (probably the humpbacks) spouting off Ruston Way</b>. Initial direction of travel was eastbound towards Foss Waterway. Second sighting of same whales at <b>2000</b> headed westbound out into commencement bay towards Point Defiance...t's entirely possible that they were the humpbacks you're talking about. I'm not exactly great at identifying whales, and tonight's cetacean sensation was no exception to this. It was a total treat to see though, without question. -Kaetlin Breen

June 20 - I saw a whale tonight about <b>5:45 pm</b> near the south east tip of <b>Hat</b>. It appeared to be just one whale. Saw it blow at least 4 times. Could not tell what kind of whale it was. By the time we got close to where we saw the spouts it was gone. -Kim Vest Gleason

Just got home after watching <b>4 Transients pass Point No Point and then 30-50 yards off Norwegian Point</b> - continuing NB at a good clip hugging Kitsap side. One small boat chasing that ran full tilt right over where they had just dove down... orcas sped up to get ahead, boat then cut engine ~100 yards out when they realized they were on top of them just N of Norwegian Pt.

My family was canoeing between <b>Bainbridge Island and Blake Island </b>(Rich Passage) and came upon a bunch of <b>Orcas</b>, male included, around <b>7-7:30</b> tonight. My daughter took this shaky video from the canoe. They turned around and paddles back to Fort Ward park....My husband said he <b>believed there were 5-7 orcas</b> and they were doing a lot of jumping. My family was headed to Blake Island but had to turn around because they the Orcas were between them and the island and the Port Orchard side of Rich Passage. My daughters said they for sure saw one male. There is no mistaking the dorsal. -Report by Amy Noel (see Facebook VIDEO by Natalie Noel)

We were at the Waterman dock in <b>Port Orchard and about 4 orca whales</b>(at least) were across the way next to Bremerton going towards the shipyard. They seemed to go along the shipyard towards Gorst and the last time we saw them (with binoculars) was right next to the shipyard kind of by the large crane. We stayed until dark hoping they would go back by but they didn't so I assume they are still down that way. No pictures because I only had my phone and they were hugging the Bremerton shoreline. Had at least one younger one in the group. Just swimming along, occasionally coming up like they do. Other people said they were feeding in Gorst. -Dawn Banks

June 16 - thanks for all of your work. Love reading the sightings reports. We were lucky enough to see <b>orcas off of the east coast of Haida Gwaii</b> last week while on vacation. My partner got a pretty good video of one - think it was a juvenile as it checked out the boat. Do you know anyone who would want the sighting report? Think we were too far north for your organization, right?...
Great. Here you go: Sat, 6/16, <b>mid-afternoon</b>, east coast of Louise Island or the vicinity. - We were observing a group of <b>5-6 orcas</b>; split to the far right and left sides of our zodiak (guided trip); right group was a larger juvenile or female and younger juvenile(s) and the left group was an adult male and another large female. - the left group moved slowly south tail slapping repeatedly
- the right group of youngsters was all over the place w one good breach. - Our guide kept us 300-400 meters away. He/we def knew not to approach or chase. - The group of 2-3 on our right starting getting a bit closer; the guide had stopped moving the boat just left the motor on. - then all of a sudden tone whale from the right group gave our boat a close up before continuing south and eventually both groups joined up again and continued slowly heading south. First video is the close encounter. Second video is really far, but you can just make out a tail slap and the bull's fin. -Sarah Chesson

Islands were joined together in this morning's extreme low tide. We navigated inside Turn Island watched by three raccoons in a tree and caught the tail end of the ebb out through Cattle Pass. We'd been listening to spectacular calls and echolocation of S<b>outhern Resident orcas on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. We are very concerned they may not be finding enough to eat so we're hopeful, hearing the echolocation, that they're finding Chinook salmon. We arrived to find them milling and then traveling with some social cuddle puddles, breaches and spy hops. The <b>J16's</b> turned towards us and vocalized into our hydrophone. We continued on the flood to circumnavigate San Juan Island taking a course north of Spieden and Flattop Islands. We spotted many eagles nests one with eaglets noticeably larger than last week and now stretching their wings. -Barbara &amp; David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing (see encounter and photos on their blog post HERE)

At <b>sunset orcas Ls were offshore of False Bay</b> going SW. -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:45 p.m. - Some still approaching Edwards Point</b> after some directional changes while fighting the tide and currents. Some individuals were fairly close in (including sprouter/older open saddle male) while others remained further out. Several have rounded the point out of view and would be <b>off Hannah Heights</b>. The currents really picked up in the past many minutes off off the point, massive turbulence, so stunning.  
<br/><b>6:05 p.m -</b> After looking like they might be heading offshore, while passing Landbank pullouts we could see <b>many have stayed in</b>. From southern pullout we can see at least 1/2 dozen directly out from us right now. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

It looked to me like just the <b>remaining Ls came down (L4s, L26s, L47s, L72s)</b> and not the Js. They were all past Lime Kiln by <b>~17:45</b> still southbound.
<br/><b>17:00 - Leaders at Lime Kiln.</b> -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~ 5:00 p.m - 5:45 p.m. -</b> Relocated to <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b>, see orcas still to the north, off <b>Bellevue Point</b>. For nearly an hour watched them stream past Lighthouse still spread widely (primarily in 1-3s) from inshore to offshore, steady pace southbound in rough seas and beautiful sunshine. 
<br/>By <b>4:30 p.m.- </b>a few who were closest in and leading were porpoising off the north end of<b> County Park</b>.
<br/><b>4:10 p.m -</b> Seeing bodies now...orcas appear in a line spread form fairly close inshore to ~ 1 mile offshore coming down island, leaders currently at the southend of <b>Open Ba</b>y. Choppy seas. 
<br/><b>3:44 p.m. -</b>  We just arrived at<b> County Park,</b> have visual on WW boats off Henry Island with more boats showing up around the bluff.

June 13 - Active Pass - Amazingly, today is the 3rd day in a row <b>orcas have gone through Active Pass. Between 2 and 4 pm</b>, a large group of <b>transients</b> approached from the west, showing some breaches, tail slaps, and cartwheels. They went through the pass east bound, almost exited, then turned around. Went into Miner's Bay, moved slowly along the shore of Mayne Island, then turned again and went eastward. One small group made one more tour around the pass before they left. At one point, the downpour almost obscured them. <b>T37B2 and T77B in Active Pass</b>.

June 13 - Swanson Channel - Today on the Chilkat Express we saw harbor porpoise galore, <b>a humpback whale near Cattle Pass</b>, and a big group of playful <b>transient killer whales in Swanson Channel</b>! The transient group included the <b>T34s, T37s (all of them!), and the T77s</b>. -Justine Buckmaster

June 13 - San Juans - <b>1:15 -1:45 p.m -</b>  Still watching the <b>Cattle Pass whale</b> continue south, currently SE of Green Can at Salmon Bank now heading SW. Tentative ID CS513 Anvil.  No luck sighting any other whales. 
<br/><b>12:45 p.m. -  Humpback cleared Cattle Pass</b> a bit ago and has continued southbound. We heard there was another Humpback (would make 3rd) off Eagle Point heading down Island about an hour ago, we are moving over to South Beach to see if we can locate that one while keeping an eye on this one. 
<br/><b>12:15 p.m. -</b> Whale is traveling steady surface intervals, sounding and presenting fluke. In <b>Cattle Pass</b> just north of Whale Rocks. (see Marilyn's photos below)
<br/><b>12:05 p.m. -  Humpback heading southbound just north of Goose Island on San Juan Island side of San Juan Channel</b>. Viewing from Cattle Point, San Juan Island. (Keeping and eye out too for 2nd whale reported south of Lopez heading this way). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw <b>a whale</b> on the ferry almost when we were pulling into <b>Friday harbor</b>...wasn't sure what it was but this might've been the whale that was spotted! (re; above sighting) we were about 10 minutes or so away from pulling into the ferry dock at San Juan from Anacortes. It was roughly around 11:30am on the left side of the boat. It definitely wasn't an orca that's for sure... the dorsal fin was super small. Couldn't tell how big the whale was...the ferry made an announcement about a whale on the port side but I guess they couldn't tell what kind of whale it was as they made no mention except for whale port side. -Gianna Cioffi

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 13 - Puget Sound - <b>6:15 p.m. - Two humpbacks off Three Tree Point</b> (Burien), mid channel, heading north. Looks to be a mama and a calf possibly? I tried to get pictures but they had some really long down times and I was just so happy to see them that I stayed in the moment. -Kim Baumgartner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

(in reply to above report) We saw them (<b>humpbacks</b>) last evening (13th) about the same time off <b>Seahurst</b>. Unfortunately no, the sighting was very brief but exciting! We saw a larger whale and a smaller one beside it heading south close to mid-channel. The larger whale blew and they both dove. Gone from our sight in an instant. -Cindy Eckes Waddington

<b>11:10 a.m -</b> relocated to friends to see the <b>Ls spread out in Spieden Channel heading west</b> at good clip. Mid channel and Spieden Island side primarily. Some moved over and looked to be heading SW as if to head south in Haro but then all stalled. Unclear at this time which direction they were committed as the whales were pretty spread out with those visible going in different directions.
<br/>(<i>Per Monika Wieland Shields: <b>L4s, L26s, L47s, L72s went Spieden</b> that day. They did not split Spieden - there was a humpback in New Channel. They went north to where Js were but Js went Swanson and Ls went Boundary</i>.)
<br/><b>10:45 a.m. -</b> arrived at Reuben Tarte Park to see fins across south end <b>Presidents Channel</b>, seemingly headng south. Short time later seemed to stall and then aim west looking like towards Spieden Channel. Those of us gathered on the rocks watched as they picked up speed making good time. Was some confusion, looked like pod may have split Spieden as some WW boats were splitting Spieden. Whatever was happening, we eventually could see many orcas heading towards Spieden Channel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Today we awoke to some fantastic sounds - the <b>Southern Resident Killer Whales were vocalizing on Lime Kiln Point State Park hydrophone</b>. First time they've been back since end of March. We could identify calls of <b>J and L Pods</b>. As the tide switched to flood, the orcas headed north and so did we in "Peniel". We met up with the orcas just <b>north of Turn Point Lighthouse</b>. The whales were spread in many loose groups. We found the trailers, the <b>J17's and L87</b>. Together we travelled along N. Pender Island up towards Active Pass. As we bumped up we encountered several other groups along the way, including<b> J22, J38 with J37 and son, J49</b> and a larger group up ahead, the <b>L47's with L90</b>. We were surprised not to see <b>L92 "Crewser"</b> in the group. Upon entering <b>Active Pass</b>, the orcas picked up speed and began porpoising - what a sight to see as the spray from the orcas' wake revealed a rainbow from the sun. We obtained some distant orca photos and also photographed <b>L72 with son L105</b>. We watched them continue on towards the direction of Vancouver before taking Georgeson Pass to start our journey for home. Our hearts felt so happy seeing our beloved SRKW's. <b>L47's</b> in a tight group. -Barbara &amp; David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing, June 11, 2018

<b>8:10 p.m. - L12s</b> have grouped tight, now just seeing blows off in the distance. Still drifting south out from <b>South Beach</b>. Currently still one WW boat with hardy peeps out there.
<br/><b>7:40 p.m. -</b> We have moved south, see <b>L12s</b> south streaming down island still, currently out from about <b>Eagle Cove</b>. We are at South Beach and see them well offshore. From American Camp/South Beach
<br/><b>~5:30 - 6:15 p.m. - </b>Arrived to <b>Land Bank/West Side Preserve</b> north pullout just in time to spot a lovely member of <b>L pod</b> right out in front of us. Over the next 45 minutes or so we watched many stream southbound super spread out, a few inshore, several others offshore, including 2 males. Much breaching happening to the south and way offshore, ~ 2 miles or so. Was invigorating. Gorgeous sunny day in a beautiful place. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network (with Marilyn Armbruster)

These two reporting parties (one written, one video) wish to remain anonymous: They looked incredible and were breaching, tail slapping, pec waves and underside showing. I was at <b>Westside Preserve</b> and it was a long <b>3.5 hours</b> but loved every minute of it. I got there just as the leaders passed by, no ID of the 2 females and youngster but they turned around just past <b>Lime Kiln</b> and joined the others NB.I felt like they were foraging and checked out the scene ahead of the group and came and said" it looks good let's go North. Apparently the L12's are passing by Land Bank SB because they turned around at Henry. The rest continued NB. -Anonymous

June 11 - San Juans - Trip Report: Another beautiful, sunshiny day as we left Anacortes with reports of orcas, including the Residents! After we checked out some harbor seals on Colville Island, Capt. Eric spotted a <b>humpback by Iceberg Point on Lopez Island</b>. We got a few good looks, including a nice fluke-up tail dive. We then headed to the <b>north side of Orcas Island to visit with some lovely transients, including some T49s and T75s</b>.

June 10 - <b>T49A's, T75B's and T75C's by Patos</b>. We set sail in beautiful conditions heading north through the islands into Presidents Channel. We saw many harbor seals hauled out on Bare Island as we crossed towards Patos Island to meet up with the socializing orcas, <b>T49A's (minus T49A1) and sisters, T75B's and T75C's</b>. Blue skies became bordered by heavy black clouds and localized rain storms. Reefing the sails as conditions changed as the whales were milling in circles. Eventually the whales split up and headed south and we set course to visit Skipjack, White Rock and Flattop Islands. Gently sailing in the lee of Flattop while enjoying our BBQ supper.

Interesting lighting conditions as a distant rain cloud headed our direction. The T49A's hugged the Orcas coastline while the T75B's and C's were on the opposite side of Presidents Channel near Waldron.

June 9 2:30pm - <b>Rosario Strait</b> then along the east side of Lummi Island - Saw a pod of maybe <b>7-10 individuals </b>comprised of females and at least one calf. Our guide thought they were transient and estimated the calf at 9 months. We followed them in Rosario Straight as they headed north. Later, we came across two males, also heading north past Lummi Island! Traveling mostly. They would do several shallow dives and comes up for air over and over and then dive under for a few minutes at a time before resurfacing. We saw 2 males and altogether around 10 individuals! -Celeste Hufford

<b>3:40 p.m -</b> I work for Parks Canada (Gulf Islands). At the end of my day we saw 4 whale watchers following <b>4 or 5 orca</b> between Piers Island and Portland Island (off <b>Swartz Bay</b>)...steadily cruising along: slow regular surfacing. (we may have seen this same group a week ago off the south end of Pender Island AND at that time it appeared they may have had a calf of the year with them) weren't close enough to get a good look today....steady travel; 4 whale watching boats, 2 on each side, somewhat controlling their direction, but adequate distance from the whales. -Frank Gee

Another great day on Saratoga! We met up with the <b>T124As with T124A2s just outside Victoria</b> today. Some tail action by <b>T124A2A</b>; notice the unique notch. The youngsters in the group were super active and we were even treated to a surprise close pass while the engines were shut down. The conditions were wonderful, too! -Justine Buckmaster

Thought I would pass this along...my friend Janet Ulin spied<b> Orcas in the middle if the Straits of Juan Dr Fuca</b>, so she put the binoculars on them and managed to get this breaching shot, just crazy. She said she counted about 6 or 7 of them. I know that is close to Victoria...and that it was about <b>1130</b>. There ended up being a whale sight seeing boat right with them too, so hopefully someone comes up with more info on them. And she said she watched them for about a half hour and they were heading east and up towards the San Juan islands. -Sandy Thompson Watne

June 6 - Puget Sound - <b>3:12 p.m -</b> There is definitely 6! One of which is a calf!
<br/><b>2:53 p.m -</b> I can count a total 5 or 6, with one large male about 1/2 mile east of the main group. Now they are less than 100 yards off of Point Robinson Park on the East side of Vashon.

The water int the straits was flat calm.

At <b>8:10 p.m. T65As</b> came in to view from around <b>Green Point, Gig Harbor</b> still in steady travel mode heading south offshore, but very much on the peninsula side. Long dive, 10 minute down time where they basically surfaced in the near same location after coming into view. They then continued now more SE bound heading towards Fox Island and surfaced in front of us out from the bluff just east of Green Point. They stalled out in this general area made some directional changes. Video below is from about 8:20, I left around 8:30 with them a little to the east outside the entrance to Hale Passage.

Rare treat on the way into Tacoma today! A<b> pod of orcas passed in front of the ferry</b> as it departed Vashon (<b>7:10am</b>). I will try to post images later....I saw them from the bow of the Chetzemoka, 7:10 sailing to Tacoma. They were moving east to west along the rip current. The male was trailing a small group of 4-6 who went deep as the ferry departed. The came up again closer to Vashon, west of the ferry terminal. The fishing boats noticed and motored over for a look. I tried to catch them on my phone, but they were too far away. - Mitch Kent

Coastal killer whales - June 4 - <b>Charleston, OR</b> - Hello! My friend Ellie and I spotted <b>a single Orca last night around 9pm </b>just west of the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (Charleston OR) jetty, near the red buoy. The dorsal fin was rather long, so we're thinking it's a male. It wasn't close enough to see markings or the saddle patch. It surfaced a total of three times, and was heading out of the bay. I have attached a photo of the Orca to this email! -Date and time of sighting: 6/4/18 8:57 pm - Location: 43.3510N -124.3311W. -Thank you, Morgan Janes &amp; Ellie Jones

Dolphins - June 2 - Colvos Passage -<b> 5:25 p.m. - Small pod of dolphins off of Sunrise Beach in Gig Harbor.</b> It was hard to tell direction. They were going back and forth and then after about 30 min I couldn't see them any more. They <b>looked like common dolphins</b>. But I could be wrong they were pretty far away. But they were not surfacing like porpoises. I am a dolphin nerd and I have seen many in the wild and my best guess would be common dolphins. Such an incredible experience. I wasn't even looking for them this time lol we just went there to hang out and cool off and bam! DOLPHINS. -Jessica Hill

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:27 a.m. - They've passed Alki Light</b>, either headed north or into Elliott Bay. There's two between the eastbound Bremerton Ferry and Alki Beach heading NE.
<br/><b>8:58 a.m -</b> They were bigger than and not as rounded as [dolpins]. Travelling in smaller groups of 1-4 stretched out over a hundred yards or so, frequent breathing made them easy to follow (unlike harbor porpoise). We've driven down to Alki, they're spread out between the Light and northbound lanes, much less organized but still easy to spot from shore.
<br/><b>8:15 a.m - A pod of ~7 just passed Lincoln Park northbound</b>, looked bigger than harbor porpoise.
(More from Andrew: We think common, and watched a lot of videos just now of the two. The ones we saw lacked the head-out posture and two-part movements of the bottlenose, and <b>seem to have the more upright dorsal of the common</b>.) -Andrew Malinak 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 2 - Carr Inlet - We spotted several groups on Saturday. <b>Lakebay area shortly after 11:00am</b>...This was <b>a group of four</b>. And they came up for air often....I recall seeing some white (per Dave Anderson asking if seeing white or yellow on their sides). -Chalcy Blake
<br/>ID notes per Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research after reviewing cell videos by both Michelle Larsen and Chalcy Blake and some discussion: "Given the location, the shape of their dorsal fins and their group size, it is <b>most likely the group of long-beaked common dolphins that really like Carr Inlet</b>. If they had white on their sides, that would make me almost certain."

There were <b>several groups of orcas</b> in the area today. While we were en route to see the<b> T65A's near Lopez</b>, another group, the <b>T49A's, were found closer over by Long Island</b>. The whales were engaged in hunting as we arrived but soon we moved on to circumnavigate Lopez Island. It was incredible watching this orca family weave in and out of the islands on the rugged southern Lopez coastline. The orcas stopped to hunt at least two more times while we sailed with them, and at one point we heard some vocals over our hydrophone. Some play time after dinner and then it was time to move on. They departed <b>out through Thatcher Pass </b>while we continued around to Upright Head. -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
