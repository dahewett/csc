Rs out west are at least some of all three. All mixed up and spread. Foraging and socializing though mostly the latter. Confirmed IDs: <b>K14s, K21, L82/116, L103/123, J14s, J35/47, J22s, J27, J37, L90, L72/105...&amp; L47s.</b> They weren't really moving, but were generally pointing back west when we left. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Sun Sep 30 - WOW! What another awesome day around <b>Sooke</b>! <b>Lunge feeding Humpbacks and a possible Super Pod with our beloved Southern Resident Klller Whales</b>. -Paul Pudwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun Sep 30 - Tim and I took our boat out looking for <b>humpbacks</b>. It started to get really rough and we were heading home slowly from <b>Possesion</b> when I saw blows up ahead! Then we lost the whale, lol! Tim says, did you lose another whale? And on cue this guy/gal flys out of the water! 10 times!!! It was hard to get shots as it was rough, but happy with these! Then the hb waved, another spiral breach, and then it waved it's tail front and back tail slaps roughly 30 times!!! Whale has been ID'd as <b>BCY0349 Masquerade</b>!! All whalewise guidelines were followed, photos taken with 150-600lens zoomed and cropped for detail! -Janine Harles

We headed up through the San Juan Islands, with reports of <b>Transient (Biggs) Orcas in San Juan Channel</b>. We caught up with the <b>T65A</b> family, who we've seen a lot this season. The matriarch is <b>T65A (b. 1986), her son T65A2 (b. 2004), T65A3, son (b. 2007), T65A4, daughter (b.2011), and baby T65A6 (b. 4/2018)</b>. Don't know if 2014 calf, T65A5 was with them. They were close in to the Shaw Island side, and slowly made their way south west from Friday Harbor (San Juan Island). They were mostly traveling, with a few tail slaps along the way. Lovely to see this "resident" Transient group! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist (all images zoomed and cropped)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

East side of Shaw near Canoe Island. 09.29.2018 @ around <b>14:00</b>. Lots of boats in the area to enjoy the show of about <b>5-6 Ts</b>. -Mette Rousseau

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sat Sep 29 - [the humpback] spent a lot of time over here on the <b>Kingston</b> side earlier this morning, between Point Jefferson and President Point for about 3 hours (I could hear it in the dark) and I would say I last saw it about <b>7:45</b>. It has been right in front of our place at several different times of the day and night for at least the last week. -Chris Beamer Otterson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:32 - Humpback mid channel off Carkeek Park</b>. Was breaching and slapping fins for a bit. -Pandora Bjeletich

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We saw a <b>humpback whale on the 11:00 Clinton ferry</b> today. -Darci Schultz

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We had the Trifecta today! Numerous <b>Humpback Whales, Transient and Southern Resident Killer Whales (J Pod)</b> all in our 3 hour adventure around <b>Sooke</b> waters...WOW! -Paul Pudwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

GRAY WHALES - Fri Sep 28 - <b>Gray whale near Polnell Point</b>, Oak Harbor [Whidbey Island] around 4PM. -Steve Smith

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

MINKE WHALES - Fri Sep 28 - We found him/her on <b>Eastern Bank</b>, basically in the middle of nowhere, at approx. <b>1:30 pm</b>. He was cooperative in that he basically kept surfacing where we expected him to surface (unusual for a Minke) but did seem to be going around in a large circle. So no real direction of travel. -Jill Hein

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

UNCONFIRMED CETACEANS - Fri Sep 28 - <b>A single orca? off of Fox Island in Hale Passage 3:00</b> Friday headed south. -  David Lester

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thu Sep 27 - Large whale, <b>humpback? Off President Point</b>, Kitsap, south of Kingston. Slapping fins for about ten minutes, moving slightly north, 2:20 pm. -Joanne Graves

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thur Sep 27 -<b> 4 to 5 pm -</b> We had a <b>big gray whale feeding in very shallow water between Spee-Be-Dah and Tulalip Bay</b> today from . Not normal to see them this time of year. I expect it's on its way South and stopped off to feed. - Margie Eliason
<br/>(<i>We have had two "new" grays this year that arrived last spring along with our usual N. Puget Sound grays, and they both stayed very late into the season. We have had reports of one of these still in the area recently, after also spending a little bit of time in South Puget Sound. This is something we have never seen happen before - to have a whale stay this long in our area - it will be interesting to see if it ever leaves or just decides to be a year round resident! -Susan Berta</i>)

J Pod Admiralty Inlet - Started our day with <b>J Pod</b> spread out across <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>! All whalewise guidelines were followed. J pod was actively foraging, breaching, cartwheeling, spy hops...<b>J27 Blackberry</b> was the big breacher of the day! We went on to Protection Island and then headed back to the Inlet. We found J pod just about to enter the Strait, with a minke whale in front of them doing it's best to get away! It obviously did not know they are fish eaters! -Janine Harles

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

What a thrill to see <b>members of J-pod travel close to Whidbey Island's west side</b> today.....<b>J16s, 17s, 22s</b> and possibly some of the <b>14s</b> were spotted. Awesome!! -Jill Hein

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:55 - J Pod at Bush Point</b>. Spread out and foraging, but trending north. -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11 am: J pod off Bush Pt.</b> - when we arrived they were really intently hunting, sending up huge sprays of water along the surface as they raced for prey. -Barbara Mundell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:08 - Two orcas off Bush Pt.</b> slowly heading north, one breach; then at 11:10 there were five orcas, close in and foraging, more breaching. -Bessie Julie

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:05 - 11:30</b> - This trip north by members of <b>J pod</b> looked very different from their trip south on Sept. 25. Then they were all business, traveling south in procession, mostly in groups, without surface action or changes of direction. Their return trip north was with enthusiasm, with lots of circling back, breaches and rollovers. I watched beginning at 11:05 AM from just south of Bush Point, and then from the lighthouse, they were spread out for miles singly or in small groups, moving unpredictably in all directions but trending north for about 30 minutes. The photo appears to be J27. -Howard Garrett

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:00 - Adult male north of Lagoon Point</b> mid channel. -Sandy Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:40 just south of Pt Townsend</b>, with ww boats, closer to PT Townsend. -Bonnie Gretz

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:00 pm from Admiralty lighthouse (Ft Casey State Park)</b> they appeared to be closer to PT and Point Wilson. 
<br/><b>2:00 pm see them from Libbey Beach</b> out a mile or so from <b>Ebey State Park heaing north</b>. 
<br/><b>2:25 angling out</b> a bit more north westerly. 
<br/><b>2:30 pm at least 3 miles out </b>and there are a few boats with them. 
<br/><b>2:45 pm can barely see them with binocs from Libbey Beach</b>, just little black dots. Still heading northwesterly and out of range. -Marilyn Armbruster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:00</b>. On whidbey side, still trending north. Passing <b>Ebey's landing</b>. Watching them from Port Townsend side, can barely see the blows. -Jonathan Crossman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Sep 26 - <b>19:00 - J Pod Haro Strait</b>. Orcas just swam by. Eagle Point. Heading north. -Chris  Wilson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>J pod at land bank, 9:12</b> hearing some breaches and slaps. -Connor Adams

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sept. 26, 9:25pm - 9:40pm, Haro Strait, SJI. In the dark! Orcas heard traveling to the NW from the westernmost edge of Hannah Hts towards and beyond Edwards Point. I imagined I could hear 4 distinct exhalations so I'm guessing 4-5 individuals (?) They were present when I first heard them so I could have caught the tail end of their passage. I ran to start up the LK hydrophone hearing the first voice at 9:59pm and the last at 10:08pm. I recorded it and have attached an 8 minute audio file of their communications. It's such a gift to have access to the hydrophones. Thanks to everyone who makes it possible! -Michelline Halliday

Wed Sep 26 - <b>16:03 - Gray? Feeding between Alan Island and Edith Point</b>. Too far to ID. - Ann Hazen

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 25</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>6:05 AM - Haro Strait/Juan de Fuca</b> - Haro Strait between Point Edwards and Hannah Hts. It was still dark when I heard the exhalations. I ran outside as the whales passed, traveling quickly to the SE. The full moon was obscured. So I listened. In the dark. There must have been many whales because I could hear an exhalation every 2 seconds for 5 minutes. The moon came out from behind a cloud and I could just make out the last 2 members that had passed by. Orcas! -Michelline Halliday

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:45 -</b> We were sailing in our 30 foot sailboat headed south with Smith Island to our west in the straits around 9:45 in the morning and we saw three orcas, one larger and two smaller. Don't think the larger was a male as the fin was not overly large. They were swimming at the surface heading south, submerging and then reimerging from the water over a period of ten minutes. They surfaced about 150 yards from our boat. We powered down and headed away from them so as not to interfere. After they disappeared from sight we waited a bit longer and then started back on our course only to see them within minutes now off our starboard bow, having gone to our other side and then disappearing for good. Such a gift to get to see them out there. We were heading back <b>to Port Townsend from Lopez Island</b>. Later fog came in. -Amy Kolve

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Just saw <b>5 orcas at eastern bank at 11:20</b>. They came out of the fog right next to our stopped boat. 1 male. They were heading SW. -Brian McLaughlin, WDFW

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:40 -</b> On the IE5. Left these orcas just<b> south of Eastern Bank</b>, heading toward the Sound/South. <b>J16s, J14s, J27 and L87</b>. There were more orcas in front of them as well. They were very active and looked to possibly be feeding. -Ang Nicholson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Tue Sep 25 - Admiralty/Puget Sound -<b> 17:00 -</b> Claudia Mitchell just called in a report of <b>six or seven orcas</b> heading south in <b>Admiralty Inlet between Lagoon Pt and Bush Pt</b>, Whidbey Isl, ~2 miles out, and others further north have confirmed this is <b>J pod</b>, on their second visit into Admiralty/Puget Sound!

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>17:08 -17:35 -</b> Just left them, now off <b>Mutiny Bay or maybe Double Bluff</b>, just steady slow travel south in the middle, although Susan saw what looked like foraging further south. 
<br/><b>6:15 pm - </b>can see them mid channel between S<b>o. Whidbey and Hansville</b>, approaching Point No Point. -Howard Garrett

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>17.53</b> watching them pass from <b>Shore Meadows Road </b>steady southbound mid channel. -Sandy Pollard  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>18:27 </b>currently seeing them off <b>point no point</b>. - Kristen Sanborn

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>18:32 pm: Seeing two separate groups from Maxwelton</b>. Way on the other side and can only see the blows. Heading south bound. Lots of splashing. Clipper on scene. -Danielle Pennington 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>18:35 - 19:00 - Trailing SRKWs rounded Pt No Pt</b> in small spread out groups, mostly traveling steadily SB w/ medium pace, occasionally pausing to forage off the Point. They ranged from 100 yards out to Kitsap side of mid channel. Observed tail slaps, others saw a spy hop. - Donna Green Van Renselaar

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Twenty-four hours after the <b>T137s</b> headed north from <b>Bush Point, J pod Southern Residents entered Admiralty Inlet and passed Bush Point heading south</b>. The orcas, resplendent against the backdrop of the Olympic mountains, continued beyond Maxwelton towards Possession as the sun set behind the jagged peaks. Three words came to mind as we watched the rise and fall of dorsal fins traveling in a steady procession in their constant search for food - "May they survive." -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Tues Sep 25 - <b>19:00</b> .....standing outside just now taking pictures of the sunset on Mt. Rainier and all of a sudden I hear a psshh......<b>Humpback</b> is back. Off shore from <b>Point Jefferson, Kingston </b>a bit heading north. -Chris Beamer Otterson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Haro Strait - Humpback between Point Edwards and western-most edge of Hannah Hts. 3:48pm ~ 4:01pm. </b>From the shore I observed a humpback followed by a calf traveling quickly towards and beyond Point Edwards. Multiple exhalations and the adult's tail came out during 2 dives. -Michelline Halliday

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Tues Sep 25 - <b>1:49 - The gray whale </b>is back! Feeding between <b>Mariners Cove and Polnell shores</b>. -Terra Parham

<br/><br/>

<br/>
 
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - <b>Orcas off Kingston</b> - This morning we had four beautiful orcas having breakfast in our backyard. Including the big male spy hopping right off our beach. I grabbed one phone shot as they swam Eastward. -Bob Towery

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:45 -</b> half dozen or more orca, one BIG one have been feeding on the<b> Kingston side of mid channel</b> for about a half hour....between Point Jefferson &amp; President Point Kingston. They are now heading north again. -Chris Beamer Otterson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Mon Sep 24 - <b>16:22 - </b>just south of yellow marker across from B<b>ush Pt., possibly T137's</b>. - Richard Snowberger

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

It looks as though the <b>T137s</b> (we believe it was them) decided it was time to head out of <b>Admiralty Inlet</b> after a few days spent in the inland waters of Puget Sound. They cut the pace off <b>Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island, and spent a couple of hours to'ing and fro'ing north to south as they milled and foraged. If the five jet-propelled breaches we saw were anything to go by, their hunting strategy was probably successful. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sep 24 - I had <b>1 humpback at 2:35pm here today in Active Pass</b> by Georgina Lighthouse travelling south. -Melissa H.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

UNCONFIRMED WHALES - Mon Sep 24 - We were boating past <b>Point No Point today around 1:30 pm</b> when we spotted <b>what we think was a solo orca</b> swimming north near the shore. We were not able to see any white on it, but it sure looked like an orca. It was a large mammal with a tall black fin. Seemed odd to see it alone which is why we are reporting it. -Karen Overstreet

9-23-18 <b>Orcas and Humpbacks</b>. Together! <b>Haro Strait, SJI</b>. Observed &amp; filmed from shore between the westernmost edge of Hannah Hts and Point Edwards. <b>2:01pm - 6:30pm</b> At first the orcas traveled to the nw towards Edwards Point with some doubling back, some moved away from the island, soon they traveled in all directions stretching as far as I could see. At <b>5:39pm 5 orcas with youngster in tow passed Edwards Point</b>, moved towards shore to the SE; spy hopping, rolling &amp; splashing, The sun was in my eyes but I believe these were <b>members of L-Pod including L103 and her son, L123</b>. At<b> 6pm a humpback traveling in the opposite direction</b> surfaced with a big-breath-roar within meters of the group just as the orcas approached Hannah Hts. -Michelline Halliday

We were fishing in the Everett Coho derby near the <b>Kingston ferry terminal about 8-8:30</b> in the morning yesterday. <b>3 or 4 Orcas</b> maybe more surfaced within 50-100 feet of our boat. We immediately pulled our gear and shut everything down and watched them till they got a safe distance from us. It was an awesome sight being my first time in the wild to see them rolling and blowing air. One appeared much larger than the others with its big fin having a slight curl to it. They were headed south towards Seattle. The rest of the day we heard on the VHF radio other fisherman spotting the pod. The last report we heard was them showing up down by <b>Shilshoe</b> bay down by Seattle. -Tom Niebauer

I took off to Fox Spit as the <b>orcas were just passing Fox Spit heading towards Greenbank/Baby Island</b>. T137s off Baby Island  changed directions but were actually milling out around mid to 1/4 mid channel as I then was watching from Baby Island Heights bluff...around <b>2:30</b> they decided to enter into Holmes Harbor and on down south towards Freeland. they cut short of Freeland around 4 and started heading back. We saw them again around <b>6 pm heading back out of Holmes Harbor</b> and heading north closer to Whidbey side out from Hidden Beach. -Marilyn Armbruster

They're back... The <b>T137s</b> powered deep into <b>Holmes Harbor </b>this afternoon, suddenly altering course from mid-channel to cruise past the former Beachfire dock (a favorite spot for seals) before abruptly turning and traveling across to the other side of the harbor. Seems the happy memories of seal buffet from three days ago were just that - memories - as they rapidly changed direction again and <b>headed north towards Baby Island and Saratoga Passage</b>.

All the whales seemed to be between <b>Hannah Heights and Eagle Point</b> and were heading slowly north before some whales stalled out and began foraging. We saw <b>K21</b> in a vigorous salmon chase off <b>False Bay</b> before he charged offshore for some more foraging. Earlier, we had seen a group of about <b>ten or so Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> streaking north not far off Kanaka Bay. A bit later, we saw them again a little inshore of where K21 was chasing his fish, fast traveling south again. They did not seem interested in playing in boat wake like they sometimes do but they stayed in the general area of the whales while the encounter lasted. Full report: Center for  Whale Research Encounter number 82.

Incredible sail with so much wildlife. Orcas from <b>K pod and L pod, Pacific white sided dolphins</b>, seals, sea lions, loons, bald eagles, diving birds, great blue herons... The orcas were engaged in lots of fishing <b>off Eagle Pt</b>. as well as some kiddie cuddle puddles. Oh and lets not leave out the incredible vocals! -Barbara Howitt

There are two kinds of dolphins in this photo. Fun day watching <b>Pacific White-sided Dolphins interact with K pod</b>! I believe this is <b>K38 "Comet"</b>, correct me if I'm wrong. (I hardly have seen Ks or Ls lately.) Also, we watched a lag nail a salmon today near the SRKWs! -Traci Walter

On Thursday 9/20 (about <b>10:20am</b>) my wife and I saw a large group of dispersed <b>orca</b> near the <b>southwest side of Moresby Island </b>(southern Canadian Gulf Islands). Difficult to count them all but probably 10-15...some were feeding near shore, some were more mid-channel (including a large male), and some were making large circles around the boat. They were all slowly heading north. Magnificent animals and always a thrill to see them! -Steve Liedle

<b>Haro Strait</b>, SJI From the shore. <b>12:01pm -1:00pm</b>; At the western-most edge of <b>Hannah Hts</b> I observed <b>15-18 orca</b> including 5-6 lg males traveling to the NW towards Edwards Point. There was a group of 3 and two groups of 2 traveling closely together. I recognized a few <b>members of L &amp; K Pods</b>. Some of the members continued past Edwards Point but at 12:20pm the second half changed direction back to the S &amp; SE, zig-zagging back and forth moving away from the island and then continued on again to the SE along Hannah Hts. At 12:30 I observed an adult &amp; youngster, <b>L103 "Lapis" and L123 "Lazuli"</b>. At 12:38pm, I saw one male breaching and I believe it was <b>K34, "Cali"</b>, showing his beautiful swirl of a saddle patch. I loved seeing the little one keeping up with Mom. -Michelline Halliday

Thu Sep 20 - I just saw <b>4 killer whales</b> and then heard calling for about another 30 minutes just a few minutes ago. This is my first time even seeing whales (just moved here) so cannot be sure but the sound was a repeated sound with occasional responses that came from 2 different directions. I thought killer whales could only be heard underwater so furiously searching to confirm it was them. Very moving. -Dyan Marie in Spirit Bay, located between Sooke and Metchosin

Well, we had the time of our lives in the afternoon <b>near Deception Pass</b>. On approach to the area we saw a whale watch boat hanging out. There were a group of, <b>I think, 5 orcas feeding</b>. We turned off our boat and enjoyed the spectacle from the proper distance away. After 5-10 minutes the whales turned north and headed straight towards us and went right under our boat. There was a male with a smaller whale and a group of three that were kind of hanging out together. -L Boucher

The moved quickly as individuals (no groups) with 2 of them doubling back just before Edwards Point to forage. The large male stayed, foraging with an accompanying excited seagull for about 10 minutes before resuming his travel to the NW. It was <b>J27</b>, the beautiful "Blackberry".

"We spent most of that encounter just sitting and listening. We could hear them breaching farther away than we could see them and when we were lucky enough to have them pass us like when <b>K33 Tika</b> breached here we could hear their voices without dropping the hydrophone. They were all mixed together, socializing and there was just an energy on the water that evening that was truly magic." -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>59 members of the Southern Resident population of killer whales made their way down San Juan Channel</b> this evening. Some whales were spread out and actively foraging while others were in big, social groups. It's an uncommon travel route for them, and even more unusually for this location, some of the whales were right on the shoreline! Here's <b>J26 Mike</b> passing right off the rocks at the Friday Harbor Labs. -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Report from Center for Whale Research - Encounter #81 Full report - Sept 18, 2018 - The whales were spread out from the shorelines of <b>Waldron Island and Orcas Island</b>. As the whales on the Orcas Island side <b>approached Jones Island</b> at the bottom of President Channel, they turned southeast down San Juan Channel. The whales on the Waldron Island side became the trailers as they also turned southeast for SJ Channel. <b>K25</b> was the last whale we saw and he was trailing the other whales, looking skinny and a little lethargic. He was non-cooperative and surfacing irregularly so we let him go and ended the encounter with him heading slowly southeast down mid-SJ Channel at 1755. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

We are dismayed and saddened at the news of another struggling Southern Resident orca and are hoping that K25 will make a full recovery. Please continue to follow the Center for Whale Research encounter reports and announcements for updated information about <b>K25's condition</b>. ~Orca Network

It's quite a treat when we have whales at the bottom of our garden, so to speak. The<i> T137's</i> paid a visit to <b>Holmes Harbor </b>today after being spotted off Hidden Beach, Saratoga Passage, before wending their way deep into the harbor where they spent some time hunting. There were a couple of dramatic breaches and cartwheels plus tail slaps and a spy-hop I didn't even know I'd caught on film. Although I didn't get down to the former Beachfire dock in time to see them cruise past the seals dozing there, I was told that as they did so one seal slipped into the water followed by the rest. Which leaves me wondering about the rationale of seals... -Sandra Pollard

<b>Haro Strait</b>, San Juan Island. From the shore between <b>9:49am ~ 11:30am</b> I observed <b>at least 19 orcas including 4 big males</b> traveling to the W/NW from <b>Hannah Hts past Edwards Point</b>. All these orca were traveling quickly and basically in a single line following a beautiful dark blue strip of choppy water that stretched across my entire view. Their dark blue highway didn't quite follow the shore and when approaching Edwards Point flowed out to the west which took the orcas farther out westerly away from the shore along Western Preserve. I was able to identify <b>J27 Blackberry</b> which just made my entire day! -Michelline Halliday

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Long string of <b>Orcas traveling north on west side of San Juan island at Eagle Cove. 9:00am</b>. At least a dozen. Unknown if they were SRKWs or transients. Two or three trailers stopped to feed. The others continued north, spaced out, single file. Boats were very respectful. It took about 45 mins for them all to pass. I'm so happy I got to see them! -Lisa Carry

GRAY WHALES - Mon Sep 17 - <b>18:00</b> - I'm seeing blows (one large whale, likely <b>gray</b>) from the Rucker Hill neighborhood looking over the navy ships across towards <b>Mission Beach/Tulalip</b>. There were areas of "dirty" water behind it, like mud plumes and it was definitely in a known gray whale spot. It was windy on the water however I don't think the blows were nearly tall enough to have been from a humpback. Even with known humpback sightings in the area I still say it was most likely a gray whale - Amy Willoughby

<b>San Juan Islands - K and L Pods</b> - With Island Adventures, encounters with K&amp;L pods! -Lisa Egashira Archidé 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Haro Strait, SJI between Hannah Hts and Edwards Point</b>. From shore I observed orcas, very spread out, from <b>11:50 am ~ 5pm</b>. At first their travels were to the SE (down island) but some doubled back again soon enough. Eventually orcas were moving in all directions. The weather was as varied as their travel; sun, rain, calm seas &amp; then chop. At mid-day during the light rain, I could see the exhalations in mist clouds above their heads all across the sea. At 4:45 pm a foursome went racing by (to the NW) smashing through the waves, water exploding around them. Very early evening there was a lovely communication on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. An empty tanker, the Nord Bosporus, went by drowning out the orcas. The orcas voices were quiet after it passed as I guess the orcas had moved on.
I am including one photo taken from shore with a telephoto lens at 1:15pm. Identity unknown. -Michelline Halliday

We encountered them just past the<b> Edmonds ferry</b> dock about east of mid channel. They were travelling south, VERY spread out. We could see whales breaching all over, including the HB's that were just west of mid channel, same area. We were shut down, when <b>J41 and J51 </b>approached the boat. J51 swam under then did a huge breach right next to the boat then did 5 or 6 more half breaches as Mom swam just a little in front of him. We left them once they moved on and went over to see Two Spot and his friend and then the double mugging happened!! All that not even 5 minutes off the dock!

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Today was a tale of two stories. On the one hand, we learned that young <b>J50 - Scarlett</b> - one of the younger members of the SRKW <b>J-Pod -</b> was declared dead by researcher Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research. On the other hand (and perhaps related??) - <b>virtually ALL members of all three of the SRKW pods - J, K, and L pods - came together for a rare "greeting ceremony" just off of Race Rocks</b> south of Vancouver Island. It was the first time in 2018 we've seen all SRKW pods together. It was incredibly moving, and by luck, we had BHT Films with us to capture some footage. -Puget Sound Express

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

SUPERPOD! One of the only times this year that almost all of the Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales <b>J, L &amp; K Pod </b>came together his morning. J's came from the east, K's from the west and L's from the south to interact near <b>Race Rocks Lighthouse</b>...WOW what sight! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We had a nice encounter with <b>L47</b>. She was with another whale, I have to identify, that did several dorsal fin slaps, breached several times and added a tail slap to almost every surfacing. -Alison Engle

<b>9:15 - 4 Orcas</b> heading north along west side of <b>Patos Island off of Alden point</b> -Cathy King

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I was at <b>Patos Island</b> on September 12, 2018 and saw three orcas from land. The <b>orcas</b> were observed starting at <b>9:15 am until 9:18 am at the Patos Island lighthouse.</b> They swam northward around Alden Point and continued eastward along the north side of Patos Island until they were no longer visible from my location. There were four harbor seals in the water meters away from land at Alden Point, but the orcas showed no interest in the seals. There were three orcas but I only took clear pictures of the saddle patch of one of orcas, which I have attached. -Antonio Flores

Watching whales in the fog is such a surreal experience. We were so fortunate that<b> T18 and the T19s</b> were circling a large meal for hours, otherwise we may have lost them as they traveled. There were a few times when they surfaced close enough we could hear them breathe, but couldn't see them! GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING! The last photo in this sequence shows some leftovers from the kill we found floating at the surface. It appears to be the skin and blubber of a Minke Whale! -Justine Buckmaster

UNIDENTIFIED WHALES - Tues Sep 11 - <b>minkes or humpbacks? - 3-4 whales feeding off north end of San Juan Island around O'Neal Island</b> trending east <b>10.45-11.11 am</b>. Pretty sure they were minkes based on length guessing 25-30 feet long, with wide unmarked flukes. Though smaller swept back dorsals could be pilot whales, but seemed bigger than that. Never saw rostrum, fins or chevron/blaze/saddle markings. Spouts 6-10 feet high. When we first saw them they seemed to be going back and forth and then settled on east and were pacing the boat for a time. Spouts were very misty. -CJ Mcanulty

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Sun Sep 9 - <b>Js &amp; Ls. And Ts!</b> - The <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones </b>were very busy today. Early in the morning <b>J and L Pod whales went down island</b>...in the a<b>fternoon they began coming back up</b>. At about <b>1:00 pm their calls started to be heard...that continued until after 5:00 pm</b>. Somewhere during that long afternoon vocal and visual encounter, <b>Transient calls started over the hydrophones at the same time that J and L Pod calls were</b>...totally cool! Not common to hear them both at the same time...does not have anything to do with them being in the same vicinity...only that the hydrophones were picking up their calls...the rain and misty sky didn't help in attempting to locate them. Then this evening at about <b>8:00pm more Transient calls over the Lime Kiln</b> hydrophones...It was a very busy day indeed! -Jeanne Hyde

<b>J and L pods - </b>What an exciting day yesterday! We headed out on one of our fall Marine Life Studies killer whale surveys. The ocean was alive in <b>northern Georgia Strait</b>, with sightings of transients, northern residents, and an encounter with southern residents! The encounter took place off Grants Reef <b>near Campbell River</b>, BC. We counted <b>close to 20 killer whales belonging to both Jpod (<b>J27</b>) and Lpod</b>. Both groups were spread out over 3 km and were foraging with long dives averaging 5 minutes. We <b>also sighted humpbacks</b> within the general area of the residents. After a few hours of observation both pods joined and began to <b>travel slowly east</b>, which allowed us to collect photographs for identification. We are still looking through photographs for J050. - Josh McInnes and Nick Templeman, Marine Life Studies, Cetacean Research

<br/>1st sighting; <b>1:15pm ~ 1:38pm</b>, I missed the beginning but observed <b>7 orcas with 1 large male traveling to the SE</b>, spread out, 3 tail slaps &amp; 1 breaching. 
<br/>Being Labor Day weekend, there were lots of boats with some disrespecting the Whale Wise Guide. Boats that were respectful were even honking at the offending boats. This is hard to watch knowing what we know about the fragility of the SRKW. -Many thanks, Michelline Halliday

Today - Part 3. <b>~17:30 - T137A</b> wowed everyone coming close to shore at Fox Spit. The whole group has now passed and are southbound as of 540. Very long down times. After being entertained by the raccoons, the whales came into view southbound. I looked at my photos, and said, that's not the T65As, that looks like the <b>T46s and T137s</b>, which in fact, it was! We were watching totally different whales from this morning we didn't even know were around. We headed to <b>Shangri La Shores</b> where the whales absolutely delighted us and several others with a close pass by at the dock. They continued south, swimming through lots of floats as they went, making their way briefly into <b>Holmes Harbor</b>. Eventually they rounded <b>Fox Spit</b>, with one of my favorite whales <b>T137A </b>passing VERY close to shore. They continued south, and I went home. Nearly 9 hours of whale chasing complete! All pictures taken from shore, at Shangri La or Fox Spit. -Rachel Haight
