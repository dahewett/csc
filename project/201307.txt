<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The <b>T30's and T75B's</b> continued to rock our world. Insane acrobatics in <b>Porlier Pass</b> (about ten miles NW of Active Pass, 15 miles SE of Nanaimo) as they hammered a helpless seal.....it was awesome! -Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A stellar encounter with the boys and mom of the <b>T101A's and 102</b>! After 4 hours of searching we finally found them coming into <b>Desolation Sound (northern Georgia Strait)</b> by Mary Pt! They were split into 2 of 2....101&amp;102 together...101A&amp;B off on the Cortes Isl shore. They took one seal there, then all 4 got together for another, then the celebratory Spyhops occurred!

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Skipper Mallard along with the Vancouver Ocean Magic were on scene with <b>a lone minke</b> whale in <b>Hughes Channel </b> between James and Sidney Island. By midday we had received reports of a group of <b>transient killer whales at the southeast end of San Juan Island heading north into San Juan Channel</b>. Skipper Matt initially found the two transients, <b>T20 and T21 in Griffin Bay</b> just south of Friday Harbour on the east coast of San Juan Island. These two transients are very familiar to us, as we saw the mother and son together frequently at the beginning of the season. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:30 -</b> Maya of WA State Ferries relayed a report from a ferry of <b>two orcas near Reid Rock in San Juan Channel</b>, heading north. Erin at the Center for Whale Research says it's<b> T20 and T21</b>.

Naturalist Brittany reported being on scene with the <b>T30 matriline</b> as well as a few other transients who were all rolling around and displaying their pectoral fins and white belly patches.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Was able to see the<b> T77's</b> make a kill in <b>San Juan Channel today at Shark Reef</b>. Got pics of T077B tugging a string of the prey's flesh around with his dorsal fin and they ended up swimming right past Friday Harbor this afternoon as they headed North. -Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

From <b>Saltspring Island in the Canadian Gulf Islands</b>: Ling Weston called in about seeing <b>two dorsal fins at 9:30 this am</b>, heading generally north past <b>Pender Point</b>. Others reported seeing up to six, including possibly two babies.

<b>7:56 pm -</b> Yay- <b>orcas off Dilworth</b> now - heading south- Vashon - about six of them. - Aimee Demarest

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify"><b>3:47 pm - Six or seven transient orca whales are out at Hein Bank</b> now and have been since this morning. They have been taking turns diving down in kind of a tag team action. Most of the whale watch boats with these whales think they have killed or are killing a Minke whale, but there isn't any evidence in the form of blood in the water or pieces of blubber floating. It wouldn't be the first time transient orca whales have killed a Minke in this area. Jury's still out on whether it was a Minke whale that was being eaten. - Deer Harbor Charters

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify">We were with them for a while this <b>afternoon </b>(Mystic Sea) - what a surprise. No scraps at all to be seen on the surface, no deep dives, and a lot of back and forth surface action. A few gulls were hovering, so there must have been some food for them. The whales had been in the same area for more than an hour before we arrived, and still there when we left. I believe they were the T037As and Bs (?) - Jill Hein 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 16</font></b></center>
<br/>
<div align="justify">John Dean called with an unusual report from Tuesday evening, of hearing many blows over about 45 minutes to an hour, after sunset, starting around <b>9:15 pm</b>, from very shallow water (6 to 10 feet deep) off <b>Kopachuck Park in Carr Inlet</b>, near Gig Harbor. He said he also heard other blows from farther out, and he heard several high-pitched whistles, much like orca calls. Eventually all the blows and calls drifted away in the darkness.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:08 -</b> I saw them! I saw them! Just for a minute off of <b>Kayak Point</b> (north of Everett)! - Desi Tracy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify">Maxine called to report the<b> pod of orcas in Port Susan</b> - north of Sunny Shore on the Camano Island side, and<b> Kayak Pt</b>. on the Everett side, at <b>8 pm</b>. They have been in the same spot for the last 45 minutes.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify"><b>4:30 pm -</b> Just saw a pod heading south just west of<b> Bush Point</b> in the main channel about 500 yards from shore. Maybe <b>five Orca whales</b>. - Scott Doyle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify">Charlie of Whidbey Island Kayaking was out on a tour at around <b>4:25 pm</b> and saw the pod of orcas <b>between Sandy Pt. south of Langley</b>, and Camano Head, heading SE.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify"><b>8 am - five orcas were reported in Penn Cove</b>, Whidbey Island, again this morning, for at least the third day in a row.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify">Today was stupendous! <b>7:13-7:30 am, 5 orcas</b> (a family with young) swam close to shore in <b>Penn Cove</b> from e. of the Rolling Hills/Riepma Rd. pier west toward Monroe Landing. Blowing and tail slapping. A seal was surfaced and swimming at shores edge w. to east at same time, just in case they were transients. - Toni Piazzon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<div align="justify">A <b>minke off the southwest side of San Juan Island</b>, identified by Frances Robertson as "Chrissy Hine." - Ivan Reiff

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 15</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>8:59 - off the pier near Madrona Way</b> or the Coupeville Wharf in town. - Denise Reynolds

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:13 pm - Transients off Whidbey in Penn Cove</b>...off the pier! <b>4-5 orcas</b>, one visibly larger. They were mid-cove out in front of the Coupeville pier headed west. Went down and we never saw them again. It was very exciting to finally spot them from our deck. - Patti Goethals Rowlson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Sounds like the larger group has separated and<b> traveling up both sides of Whidbey</b>. There were <b>at least 20</b> when we first saw them a few days ago west of Shilshole making a kill. It was amazing! - Renee Ramirez

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 pm -</b> Stephanie Raymond from the Victoria Clipper called to report <b>a pod of 5 Transient orcas</b> (no adult males) <b>between Point No Point and Possession Pt.</b> heading south. Not sure if this is the same pod seen earlier between Seattle/Bainbridge, or the rest of the 17 orcas that were all in Puget Sound together on the 13th.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>1830 </b>this evening saw <b>3 orcas a hundred yards off shore of Polnell Point</b> (across from Oak Harbor) on the east side of Whidbey Island. A nearby neighbor said there were 6-7 orcas. Lost sight of them at <b>1845 </b>as they rounded the southerly tip of Polnell Point, the eastern most point of Crescent Harbor, north up Saratoga Passage from Baby Island. Polnell Point is almost as far north as the north end of Camano Island...but due west since it is part of Whidbey Island. Not sure if they headed into Crescent Harbor, or perhaps south in Saratoga Passage. - Steve Rothboeck, Oak Harbor

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

"Spouting News" MARINERS COVE/SKAGIT BAY TRANSIENTS. Was with my brother out on the water; <b>off Mariners Cove</b>. In a place we were meant to be at <b>4:30PM </b>on this hot summer day. Glanced, out aways, [totally unexpected] and there they were. A quick blink, yes, Orcas, heading northeast towards Strawberry Point. On the move and then a sudden left turn, wala, no longer on the move. Circling, going back &amp; forth staying in one area. <b>Maybe 9 Transients</b> to a dozen, with a big guy with big dorsal fin. Within 20 minutes they all headed really close into shore, in shallow water. Many/all of them 'shoulder to shoulder' so to speak, where lots of splashing occurred for close to 10 minutes. Could they have trapped a school of salmon [or a seal?] in maybe 10 to 15 feet deep water max? Could go on and on for the hour and a half we were treated to/observing these wolves of the sea. Dozens of tail lobs/splashing from many, especially, the smaller ones. A number times periscoping, with head vertically out of the water. Numerous, breaches; including, one that breached 3 times in a roll. Many Mariners Cove members watching from the jetty and shoreline. Little past 6PM, they headed southwest towards Polnell Point. Still, breaching, tail lobbing, and cavorting, in boisterous fun. Totally in their element, with the Olympic Mountains high over head in the distance. But maybe not as 'high' as experiencing these whales in action. - Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor Whidbey Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:57 pm - </b>leaving the <b>T30's in Cresent Harbor </b>heading south. So those of you south of Oak Harbor in Saratoga Passage should be seeing the orcas come by again soon! - Michael P Colahan, Island Explorer3

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:42 - </b>I found them! I was so excited and screamed so loud I scared my kids and they started crying. It was pretty much the most exciting experience of my life! Watched them off and on from the lookout point on<b> Seaplane Base</b> for close to an hour. Going Northeast, maybe? They appeared to be moving really slowly when we first (finally!) saw them, then they picked up speed. There was a boat that was staying with them the entire time, I assumed it was some sort of research team. They were closer to Camano Island when I reluctantly drove away. THANK YOU for keeping us all informed about sightings!! - Krista McVay Lee

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:45 am - </b>Billy Wind called to report the <b>pod of orcas were in Oak Harbor</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Between 11:00 and 11:30 AM</b> we saw <b>a pod of orcas</b> go by...we were pretty much straight west <b>off Magnolia</b> sailing southbound. In the picture you can see a navy sub being escorted southbound by the Coast Guard to Bremerton on the far west side. Seemed to be maybe three to four adults and one small one, heading north, mostly just traveling but stopped once to 'play' for a few seconds, then continued on. I know the photo is not much help, my camera just couldn't keep up with them!  :) - Pam

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11am - </b>Sailing into the racecourse from <b>Oak Harbor to Penn Cove</b> we saw a big old orca party...breaches, zoomin around, flips, more breaches...looks like the hunt was on. Not the first sighting but biggest and best. - Mike Cain

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Sammye Kempbell of Coupeville called to report the pod of <b>7 Biggs orcas at the entrance to Penn Cove</b>, near the green buoy at <b>10:55 am</b>, heading NE toward Oak Harbor. Sammye called again to say there is a young orca in the pod. This sounds like the same pod that was there yesterday - <b>the T30s (male is T30A), and T75s.</b>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Marie Waterman of WSF called to report a pod of<b> 3 orcas heading north</b>, seen at<b> 9:55</b> by the ferry Tacoma on their <b>Seattle - Bainbridge Island Run</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I'm sure you already know this but I'll tell you anyway: <b>two Orcas crossed the bow (Seattle end) of the M/V Tacoma </b>this morning around <b>0950</b>.  Possibly two miles northwest of Alki.  Swimming together and headed northwesterly. - Larry Brown

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spotted<b> two small Orcas</b> moving fast just off of<b> Restoration Pt. on Bainbridge</b> Island Monday at <b>9am</b>. They only surfaced twice that I saw and there didn't appear to be any other whales in the area. I was the captain of a boat taking 200 kids to camp so we couldn't hang out very long (plus we were right in the middle of the southbound traffic lane when we saw them). - Paul Mooselips Dudley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A group of neighbors watched for about a 45 minute period <b>a pod of Orcas feeding in a spot about 1 mile south of Race Lagoon</b> on the East side of Whidbey Island about 500 yards off the beach. <b>Several large Orcas and 2-3 medium sized and 1 or two smaller whales.</b> Total size of pod 5-7 in total. They were circling and diving all in the same area for the time we observed them, thus appeared to be feeding. - Bill Wiegand

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:46 am - Two young orcas</b> spotted in the middle of Puget Sound off of<b> Alki beach</b>. - Regan Timm

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Don't know if it was reported, but saw <b>a small pod from the Vashon water taxi</b> just north of the <b>Vashon ferry dock</b> this morning around <b>8:20am</b>. Not sure which direction they were headed. - Carolyn Barr

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Three of <b>four humpbacks </b>we saw. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Tony reports <b>one Humpback whale in Malaspina Strait, BC</b>, traveling west/NW at <b>7:10 pm</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A <b>minke in the Hein Bank</b> area lunges through a bait ball of schooling fish. - Marcie Callewaert


<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 14</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>8:02 pm -</b> We see them from east Whidbey. Far over close to<b> Camano</b>, at what I can best describe as south of Seth drive area. At least one large dorsal fin male. At least 5. - Jonathan Bent

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Tonight around <b>8:00 PM off of Summerland Beach, Camano Island</b> saw a group of s<b>ix orca headed south toward Hat Island</b>. It appeared there were four large adults and two smaller orca. Very excited to see them in Saratoga Passage!!! - Paulette

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:35pm - </b>Last I saw they were halfway to <b>Bells Beach, Whidbey Island</b>, just south of Fox Spit, much closer to Camano. Moving pretty fast. Lost them now.
<br/><b>7:08 pm - </b>Just north of <b>fox spit closer to Camano now</b>. Still headed south. - Sara Young

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:40 - </b>Just up again right north of <b>Baby Island</b> land bridge.
<br/><b>5:34 pm - </b>Trending toward into<b> Holmes Harbor</b>.
<br/><b>5:18 -</b> Blows due west of <b>Cama Beach on Whidbey side</b>.
<br/><b>5:16 pm - </b>They're heading back south in<b> Saratoga Passage</b>. Got blows right now due west of <b>Cama </b>over at Whidbey shore. - Will Murphy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:18 am -</b> Just got a call from Connie Barrett that at least <b>4 or 5 orcas are in Saratoga Passage</b>, about a mile north of Cama Beach off Camano Island, generally traveling north but have stopped now and are milling.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9am - a minke off Flint Beach</b>, south end of Lopez, going east to west. - Sally Reeve

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 13</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:35 - </b>A group of folks were treated to a great show today for over an hour and a half (<b>11:00 - 12:30</b>) between <b>Skiff Point and Rolling Bay near Bainbridge Island</b>.

The <b>L22's, Spirit (L22) and her sons Skana (L79) and Solstice (L89) </b>maintained a serene pace as they took part in the 'west side shuffle' off <b>San Juan Island</b> today. Skana stayed close to his mother while Solstice foraged a little further inshore. As "Mystic Sea" left the tranquil scene Solstice joined his mother and brother, and all three whales traveled northbound in harmony. Lots of boats present, also Soundwatch busy educating boaters and WDFW keeping a watchful eye. Three Minke whales made fleeting appearances off Salmon Bank as we headed homeward, so we had a mixture of baleen and toothed whales today. Then there were the Pacific Harbor seals, harbor porpoise and eagles - just another perfect day in the Pacific Northwest. - Sandra Pollard. Freeland, Whidbey Island

After spending most of the morning doing a <b>'west side shuffle'</b>, <b>Js Ks and Ls</b> began to split up and make their way north. Most of them headed east in <b>Boundary Pass</b> after passing Turn Point, but the<b> K13s went west up into Swanson Channel</b>. We met up with the K13s at around <b>15:30</b> as they were tight to the shoreline along the Pender Island Bluffs, fairly spread out. When they passed Thieves Bay, K20 and K13 began tail slapping numerous times, then the 7 whales all came together to rest, diving methodically and rising in unison. We followed them to the mouth of Active Pass, where they started to "wake up" and change behaviour, becoming more spread out and even spyhopping a few times. - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

The fun continued today. Wonderful groups with a mix of <b>J's and K's heading north from Kellet Bluff</b>. Yesterday, we had crazy activity and today was a lot more mellow.

Around<b> 15:00</b>, we met up with a  group of <b>L pod whales 2NM north of East Point</b>. In attendance were the <b>L55s, L72-L95-L105, L90-L92, and the L47s</b>. Missing were the L12s, L22s, L84, L87, and L88, who were on the San Juan Island west side at the time. I did not manage to account for the L54s or L53 in this group, but I might have just missed them in my photos, or perhaps they were with the group of <b>Js and Ks making their way south down Rosario </b>at the time this encounter was taking place. Its interesting to see the social dynamics and the "whos with who" during times when all three pods are in the same area. They were surfacing mostly as one large group (beautiful!!), making a slow pace in the current between Patos and East Point. They began to spy hop and mill for a brief period, as if a decision was being made as to which direction to go. Rather than carry on up toward the Fraser River, they all turned south east toward Rosario, where the Js and Ks were. Great encounter, a real treat to have these whales back in the area. - Tasli Shaw

A bit foggy passing Cattle Point Lighthouse, then <b>orcas off of one of their favorite dining places- False Bay</b>, chattering away! They seemed intent on foraging for King-Chinook salmon- their primary food, as they milled about with directional changes.

Yesterday was pretty amazing! Lunging<b> Minkes in the AM</b> and the <b>Super Pod in the PM</b>. FINALLY! We were seeing <b>Ks for the first time in months</b> and we hadn't seen Js for about a month. We left part of them headed north toward the Fraser River. In terms of sightings, May and June and early July were the worst in memory, but maybe that's the norm. We have been studying Resident Orcas for such a short time. We ego-centric humans! We study a species for a few years of their behavior, out of the thousands of years that they have been in these waters, and we think we know everything there is to know about them. - Capt. Jim Maya

We had a lovely view from the shore of about <b>20 orcas heading north up Navy Channel at Dinner Point (Canadian Gulf Islands) between 8:30 and 9:30 pm</b>. We were over 1/2 mile away. We believe they continued north up Trincomali Channel but may have turned into Active Pass. We saw lots of blowing, several tail splashes and several fins flap with loud noise on the water, and one breach. Several ferries and recreational boaters and a couple of Canadian navy boats in the area that would have got an even closer view.  - Linda Jones, Okemos MI

We had a <b>Minke in the group of killer whales on our 5:30 </b>Sunset Whale Watch Tour that seemed to be having somewhat of an identity crisis. It was<b> traveling with the L-Pod members L-22, L-79, and L-89</b>. It became clear when the Minke whale jumped clear out of the water in a breach that this whale was having some serious misidentification issues. I have NEVER seen a Minke whale breach and seeing one breach is incredibly rare! My fellow naturalist, Aimee, and I were literally hopping for joy! - Heather, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris

I wanted to report<b> a humpback whale</b> that surfaced very near our sailboat in <b>Georgia Strait</b> when we were passing the outer Ballenas Island around <b>1:30 pm.</b> Just one. We were traveling south on a downwind sail and had been on the same tack for perhaps an hour.  It came up just enough to see the fin and part of its back, paused for a moment, then sank again. So although it was uncomfortably close to us there was no chance to identify it in any way  It is possible that it had surfaced some minutes earlier...we heard an odd gushing but in all the wind and waves it is hard to be sure it wasn't just the dinghy. This is the second time we've seen a humpback in Georgia Strait. Last summer on August 12 around 10 am while crossing from Comox to Pender Harbour in our sailboat we were on a convergent path with a humpback that also was going north. We were about a third of the way between Comox and Pender Harbour, north and west of Texada.  We saw it surface from a distance several times, and when we realized it was getting close we tacked away and didn't see it any more.  It was heading north in a beeline. -Gail Kucera

Report from the whale centre in Tofino BC that the<b> T069s were off Hot springs near Tofino BC Canada</b>. The T069s are very common along the West coast of Vancouver Island and usually tag along with the T041s and T065As. - Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Seven orcas, the <b>T137s and T36As</b> were found headed north through <b>Active Pass</b>, and they were half way up the Galiano shore line by the time we met up with them. They were surfacing in a fairly strait line and not changing course as Ts are wont to do. I believe they made two kills while we were with them, due to sudden milling behaviour, followed shortly by bursts of activity (tail slaps, a surface lunge or two, and a series of spectacular breaches by 11 year old male T137A). The two youngsters in the group (T36A2 and T137D, both are approximately a year old, both born in 2012) were quite rambunctious with each other, which is always charming to watch.

We had the most amazing <b>minke whale </b>encounter I have EVER had in 17 years of being out on the water. Huge bait balls of fish surrounding the Western Prince, and out of nowhere, a minke grabbed a bait ball less than 20 feet in front of the boat. Fish flying everywhere, we watched him swallow up the fish, roll over sideways and push the air out of his mouth. So amazing that the passengers wanted to stay with the minkes instead of going to see the orcas. Jonathan Stern, you would have been so proud! - John Boyd

Caught up with the<b> T75 and T77 matrilines</b> going north west near <b>Beaumont Shoal around 16:30</b>. They treated us to a slow and steady pace of surfacing as a group 5-6 times then diving for 4.5-5 minutes. It was a beautiful afternoon, with calm seas and golden light which seemed to illuminate each breath the whales took.
<br/>Just as a fun sidenote, the L12s were in relatively close proximity to these Biggs. The resident whales were between False Bay and Eagle Point on San Juan Island, and the Biggs were just a few miles off shore from them at one point. Yeahhh good day - Tasli Shaw

<b>9:05 -</b> Just got home form <b>Mukilteo</b>, after waiting for an hour, was about the leave when I saw <b>blows out towards Whidbey</b>. A group of about 5, no mature males that I could see; looked like all females and immature, younger ones. Kept a steady northward pace, just to the Whidbey side of mid channel. Watched them until they were <b>past Clinton</b>, headed towards Saratoga Passage - Pam Ren

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 pm -</b> My sister just spotted them just <b>south of Clinton</b> going north approaching the Ferry Ln., Midchannel closer to the Clinton side. - Kathy Wahl

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:01 -</b> Just found those <b>Ts again in Possession Sound</b>, heading north. Looks like the same ones we saw at Possession Point this morning--Maybe T50s? - Stephanie Raymond

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:46 -</b> The Victoria Clipper just saw the <b>transients between Edmonds and Apple Tree Point</b>, middle of the sound. There was some tail lobbing happening. - Kaarin Jacobson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:40 -</b> Capt. Korie onboard the Olympus just left the same group of<b> whales at Possession Point</b> again moving east! - Sarah Hanke

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:15 -</b> Maya of the WA State Ferries just called to relay a report from the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton ferry</b> that a <b>pod of orcas was seen one mile north of the ferry lane</b>, headed for Hat Island.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:55 -</b> Stephanie Raymond, naturalist on the Victoria Clipper, is with <b>transients </b>again. This time five Ts are <b>off Possession Point</b> on the south end of Whidbey Island. They aren't traveling much, mostly milling in the same area for the past 20 minutes, so they could head east into Possession Sound or west up Admiralty Inlet, or south into Puget Sound.

Off <b>Middle Bank</b>, we, the Ocean Magic II encountered, in very rough water, a group of <b>3 females and this big Male, who was ID's as T 072</b>. It looked like he was travelling with the T 75's. We lost them in the fog that was drifting in as they headed south west. He is believed to be a very rare visitor to these waters. - Marie O'Shaughnessy, Orca -Magic, Prince of Whales. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

We spent a very warm Canada day on the hunt for cetaceans in the Salish Sea, and by a very lucky stroke got to spend time with <b>4 transients off Middle Bank </b>(Strait of Juan de Fuca). The wind and waves were picking up which cut our encounter short, and these apex predators were certainly keeping us on our toes, exhibiting extreme zig zagging behaviour, heading south for a few short breaths then down for another 4.5 minutes only to be heading in the opposite direction north 1/4 mile away. In addition, they kept a steady pace of 7 knots through the 2-3 foot (and building) seas.
I managed to identify the group as <b>T72 with the T73As</b> (a mother with two offspring). Not sure if this is correct, as I never got confirmation, but if it is indeed them, what a treat! This group is not often encountered in the Salish Sea.  - Tasli Shaw

<b>4:00 PM -</b> I saw several <b>orcas from the ferry between Mukilteo and Clinton</b> heading from west to east, from Langley to Everett. - Volker Harms

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas heading south off Bush Point</b>. - Marlene Norton Naughton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Just saw <b>5-6 Orcas off of Bush Point 9:25 PM</b> heading South - Marlene Norton Naughton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:18 -</b> They were heading south until I lost sight of them. Closer to <b>North Beach </b>side of the sound.
<br/><b>8:26 -</b> Just spotted [<b>orcas</b>] off the coast of <b>North Beach/Blue Ridge</b> (just north of Shilshole)! - Megan Campbell-Miller 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Stephanie Raymond was with <b>four transient orcas in the Strait of Juan de Fuca SE of Trial Island</b>, southeast of Victoria, heading west fast at <b>1 pm</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:34 - 2 transients spotted at Middle bank</b>. - Josh McInnes
