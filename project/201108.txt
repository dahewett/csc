<br/><br/>
The <b>T60`s</b> were off <b>Albert Head BC</b> in the afternoon, <b>T31 </b>passed William Head eastbound heading for the 60`s, T11 and T11a were westbound off William passing directly by T31. great day on the water with Transients!
<br/>Reid Philip
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient Orcas (T060s)</b> came right into shore at Saxe Point in <b>Victoria BC between 1:50 and 2 PM</b>. One came into the bay while the others stayed a little further out. One graced us with a spyhop! And was probably the one that did an upside down tail lob and righted itself! I believe there were 4, but when I was looking through the ID catalogue there are 3? 
<br/>Tim Green Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcasound hydrophones - Ts</b> headed north (travel direction inferred from previous detection <b>5km south at Lime Kiln</b>).
<br/>*<br/>
It's <b>T's</b> - probably 3+ miles offshore, but we could see faint blows and splashes from breaches!
<br/>Heather Hill
<br/>*<br/>
Faint <b>calls on Orcasound</b> now, <b>7:34 am</b>. Sound like possible transient calls.
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:22am</b> hearing faint <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Lime Kiln hydrophones 7:22am Ts</b>. Auto-detection of a possible transient call an hour ago (reinforced by subsequent detection 5km north at Orcasound)

Off <b>Clark and Barnes Islands</b> (just <b>above Orcas Island</b> on the east side just as you come north out of Rosario Strait) - afternoon. T's traveling right on the rocks created come interesting lighting :) 
<br/>Katie Jones 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient killer whales </b>were the big sea creatures in town today! We went out to the <b>Rosario Strait</b> just past Orcas Island in search of ocean life. In the distance, we could see a splash then a white cloud indicative of whale snot (a blow) and then a black fin. After another minute, two more whales surfaced and then a female and a little orca. And then, even further, we saw yet another group of four or five transients. Generally, transient (mammal-eating) killer whales are found in pods of four or five but today it seemed that multiple pods were gathering in larger numbers. Theories as to why this occurs can include anything from spreading the gene pool to socializing to hunting. At one point, we did also see a harbor seal pup in the menagerie, perhaps trying to escape becoming a killer whale meal. We learned later that T036 and T036B were part of the group we saw.
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>~8 transients</b> between <b>Hope Is and Seal Rocks</b>, (south of Fidalgo Island, Skagit Bay, <b>Saratoga Passage</b>), hunting seals. Young calf with them (still yellow saddle/eye spots), mom seemed to have a bump protruding from center of the base of her dorsal fin on the right side.

<br/>*<br/>
Orca sighting: <b>at least 5 orcas</b> off Seal Rock in <b>Skagit Bay</b> (48 deg. 22' 28.79" N, 122 deg. 33' 48.91" W), traveling south at 10 AM on 8/30/2011. First I've seen in this area.

We were with the Eclipse whale watching tour by <b>Victoria waterfront Great chain Islands at 3:15</b> pm we think it was <b>T31</b>.... Thanks  
<br/>Daniel Acosta
<br/>*<br/>
We had a fun <b>afternoon </b>with <b>T31 </b>today, playing hide and seek around <b>Trial Island</b> ..pretty sure he got a seal too!

Was fishing for pink salmon when I saw a slower than usual Clipper Ship pass by going south <b>between LaConnor &amp; Whidbey Island's  Strawberry Point</b>. Decided to follow and was surprised when Clipper came to a stop at <b>around 5:30PM</b>. It was a beautiful evening with puffy clouds above Cascades, so I thought the stop was to view the scenery. I noticed a crowd of people, all at the bow and then I saw ORCAS. Clipper let the <b>6 or 7 orcas </b>pass by and they were on the move/heading north. Clipper turned around and at slow speed keeping its distance, along with a yacht, a neighbor friend, and myself following Clipper's lead. At bouy entrance to LaConnor, transient orcas stopped to feed. All boats came to a halt and I was next to Clipper Ship watching orcas, with no little excitement when we saw couple of tail splashes. After the short feed on presumed pinks (note: these were likely transients, who eat only marine mammals), they went on their way north. As Clipper and other boats left, I decided to stay and was rewarded when <b>Orcas did an about face and headed back towards me/going south</b>. More, feeding as orcas circled, just south of LaConnor entrance, again. Then, off they went northbound towards Hope Island and possibly Deception Pass. Great stuff. When I returned to Strawberry Point where boats were fishing for pinks, another friend told me when orcas passed by to feed, he observed two of the smaller orcas surface at the same time/heads straight up with their mouths wide open. Does it get any better than that?
<br/>Robert Stonefelt
<br/>*<br/>
Ed Young of Whidbey Island Kayaks called to report encountering <b>a small pod of orcas off Sandy Pt</b>, south of <b>Langley, Whidbey Island, WA at 11 am</b>. There were approximately 6 orcas, breaching, tail slapping, etc.
<br/>*<br/>
Nona Hill called at <b>11:28 am</b> to report a pod of at least <b>7 orcas off Sandy Pt, Whidbey Island</b>, close to the point breaching, tail slapping, and spy-hopping for quite some time, then heading north. Two of the orcas were smaller, one of them very small.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:15 pm: 4 orcas</b>, including 1 large and 1 small one, were crusing inside <b>Elger Bay, Camano Island</b>, off Camano Island State Park, foraging and milling in 60' of water.
<br/>Roger Clark, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:30 </b>- Clipper II just passed another <b>small group of northbound Ts in Saratoga Passage</b>, just north of Camano Head.
<b>6:30 </b>- Victoria Clipper III just found <b>4 transients northbound</b> at Strawberry Pt in Skagit Bay and followed them to just south of Swinomish Channel. They're moving pretty fast but seem to be hunting as they go.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas heading north in Saratoga Passage</b>, just north of <b>Langley </b>about <b>noon</b>. Oh, what a time for a longer lens. At least the whale bell in Langley worked well. Crowds were able to see the parade of fins.
<br/>Tom Trimbath
<br/>*<br/>
Just spotted <b>a pod of @ 5 or 6</b> appear to be Orca passing the <b>Mukilteo Ferry Landing ~ 8:30 AM </b>Monday..near all the fishing boats not far from shore, heading east.
<br/>Mary Ann Macomber
<br/>*<br/>
Today we traveled all the way to <b>Victoria </b>to see <b>one lone transient</b>. He was magnificent. It was a long haul but when we arrived he appeared to be patrolling up and down the rocks. He has one of the broadest dorsal fins I have ever seen. The word on the street was that he had been harassing a sea lion prior to our arrival.  When we got there he was just cruising, back and forth along the rocks, occasionally rolling slightly on his side as if he was looking up toward the rocks to see what was on the lunch menu.

This <b>pod </b>was seen Sunday going south in <b>Case Inlet</b>. These pictures are from Herron Island looking West to Harstine Island. 
<br/>Lauren West 
<br/>*<br/>
A group of <b>8 or so orcas</b> was seen on three consecutive days (August 26, 27, 28) in <b>Case Inlet in south Puget Sound</b>.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reports encountering the <b>T100s from Bell Island, WA to Tumbo Island, BC</b>, on their way to Active Pass.  
<br/>*<br/>
I just came in from the deck and an hour of "whale watching" from my porch. There were a<b>t least 6. They were coming out of Budd Inlet</b> - right near Boston Harbor. They were traveling north along that eastern shore.  So, I'm looking at them from a distance of two inlets. They have now made their way north through <b>Dana Passage</b> - where I lost sight of them after they rounded the corner of Harstene Island.
<br/>Kim Merriman
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>7:30 pm - in Tacoma</b>, about 1/2 mile north of the <b>Narrows Bridge</b> - heading north towards Point Defiance. Saw <b>at least 8-10</b> - they were moving rapidly and jumping - we could see the dorsal fins and their heads above the water.  We have lived here for over 4 years and have not seen Orcas here before. A Coast Guard boat was about 3/4 mile behind them. 
<br/>Jeannine Mott  
<br/>*<br/>
Yesterday at <b>3:30 PM </b>I observed a group of<b> 10-15 orcas in the vicinity of Boston Harbor</b>, including at least one male. The animals were moving toward the East in strong currents. 
<br/>Raphael Martin  
<br/>*<br/>
Residents gone today, but the <b>T100s showed up north of East Point, Saturna Island, BC</b>.  
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
@ <b>7:30 pm</b>. Latitude, Longitude: 47.277831,-122.541504
A group of<b> 10-12 Orcas traveling North under the Narrows Bridge</b>. We have never spotted whales here. Were they maybe feeding down at the Nisqually Delta on seals?  
Spotted them from our Deck at 3016 N. Narrows Dr. Tacoma, WA 98407
<br/>Katy and Andrew Madderson   
<br/>*<br/>    
We saw them at about <b>5:30-ish</b> as they were heading out toward <b>Henderson Inlet</b>. We counted <b>at least six, maybe as many as eight</b> including a very young <b>orca</b>. They were moving fairly fast so I just kept snapping photos. The sheriff boat here yesterday may have a better count. We called them to thank their effort. They were not in the bay here for very long.
<br/>Scott Berg. 
<br/>*<br/>
We were thrilled yesterday to spot <b>4 whales </b>right in front of our cabin property in<b> Case Inlet</b>, WA. It was a sighting of a lifetime. My grandfather who has been going to the cabin for over 80 years said he has never seen any orcas in the area. It was wonderful!! 
<br/>Eliza Webb   
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:10pm</b> - My friend just said they were breaching like mad out at Burfoot Park, here in <b>Olympia near Boston Harbor</b>. Now they're headed toward Woodard Bay....and so are my friends! 
<br/>Diana McCandless
<br/>*<br/>
<b>About 10</b> or so sighted going south past <b>Boston Harbor Lighthouse</b> just after <b>2:00 pm </b>this afternoon. They turned around and headed north <b>around 2:15pm</b>. Did a show for all the fleet following them (at an appropriate distance) for at least an hour as they headed through Dana Passage. At one point they split into two groups. There were some young ones in the front group and it was almost as if some of the adults were doing a sweep to make sure everyone moved forward safely. They did some breaches, but mostly surfaced and swam forward. One or maybe two of the smaller ones appeared to try doing flips. What an experience. 
<br/>Margaret McPhee
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>4 Orcas</b> today, at about <b>noon</b>. We were looking east from Herron Island and the whales passed traveling <b>southbetween Herron and Hartstein Islands</b>. First, the largest one breached twice and got our attention, only about 20 yards from shore. About  a minute later 3 more passed by, close together, breaching several times. Two appeared to be smaller than the first and the third seemed much smaller. They just continued swimming east at a pretty good pace. 
<br/>Marilyn Polis
<br/>*<br/> 
On Maya's Westside Charters at about <b>3:45 p.m.</b> in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b> we had an encounter with the <b>T100s</b>. It appeared they had made a kill and were having a meal.  There was some exciting surface action including a double spyhop - one whale facing us and the other facing the other way. Included here is either T100E or T100B1 caught on camera in the middle of an exuberant breach. For more pictures and the story see my blog: Whale of A Purpose - 8-28 'Doing A Double Take'
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:30 or 6pm</b> -  we spotted a group of about <b>5 or six at the south end of Anderson</b>. We moved into Oro Bay to fish and found at least 3 young looking whales playing and swimming up to boats fishing in the bay. All boats in the bay stopped to watch as the whales played for about 30 minutes before heading out toward Ketron Island. We left Oro Bay at <b>7pm </b>and headed back toward Narrows Marina. We caught up with a large group heading north just off of <b>Steilacoom</b>. It was hard to count them but we estimate there were <b>around a dozen</b>. We followed them for about an hour as they continued to make their way north following the Tacoma side shoreline heading north toward Tacoma. We finally passed the group near Day Island. They were playing, breaching, jumping, tail slapping. There was at least one very large whale that seemed to be leading the parade on Sunday.
<br/>Doug and Donna Hogeberg
<br/>*<br/> 
We saw five <b>orcas </b>go by just west of <b>Squaxin Island</b>, headed south.
<br/>Michael and Sally Brick
<br/>*<br/>
Carrie Newell reported a pod of <b>6 orcas, 5 females and 1 male, off Depot Bay, OR at 7:15 am</b>, in 200' of water heading south fast.
She also observed <b>humpback whales</b> in 220' feet of water,  
<br/><br/>
<b>August 27, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Carrie Newell reported observed <b>one or two Blue whales</b> in 220' of water <b>off Depot Bay</b> OR.
<br/>*<br/>
Saw<b> 10 orca</b> just <b>west of Squaxin Island at 8:30 am</b>. They were headed north and were playing. 
<br/>Michael and Sally Brick
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5pm </b>- we saw <b>about 5 Orca </b>playing just off the <b>mouth of Oro Bay, Nisqually/Anderson Island</b>. They looked like they were heading south to Olympia, around the sound end of Anderson. They looked like they were just heading somewhere. 
<br/>Doug and Donna Hogeberg
<br/>*<br/>
There was <b>a pod of orcas in Case Inlet</b>, about a mile south of the entrance to Vaughn Bay, maybe half a mile south of 47 deg. 20 " N.  We could not count accurately. We watched them, from land,<b> from about 1:45 to 2:30 pm</b>. You probably had a lot of reports, as at one point there were 13 boats watching. I would like to know who they were, transients or residents. (Most likely transients.)
<br/>Paul Kellogg 
<br/>*<br/>
My neighbor saw a pod at the <b>northern entrance to Budd Inlet</b> yesterday. Haven't seen them since, but we've enjoyed seeing a couple of bottlenose dolphins in the inlet for a couple of weeks.
<br/>Rob Penney  
<br/>*<br/> 
We sighted a number of <b>orcas in Case Inlet</b>. There appeared to be a total of <b>at least eight</b> and to include a couple of calves and also perhaps a couple of males. They worked their way up Case inlet by Stretch Island to about the town of Allyn. They then worked their way south and appeared to be <b>heading down Pickering Passage</b>. All of this over about a four hour period. From what we could tell from our vantage point the boaters were respecting the animal's space.
<br/>Tom Richards  
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>midday;  3 Orcas</b> -  One larger than the others (bigger dorsal); <b>Bainbridge Island, WA</b>; off south side of island on Rich Passage - near Fort Ward State Park; Headed east back into sound; most likely transited from north down around west side of island (through Agate Passage); Latitude, Longitude: 47.58460, -122.52760; Activity: slowly transiting area - coming up for air every minute or so; sea lions &amp; harbor seals frequently spotted in this area; harbor seals pupping nearby; lost track of them as they approached offshore salmon farm enclosures &amp; small rocky island on SE point of Bainbridge Island, like they submerged for a long period. Apparently sightings in the location are rare. A neighbor, who's lived here for 10 yrs, has only spotted one orca during those 10 yrs. Oddly enough, she told us this the day before our sighting.
It was amazing!!
<br/>Scott &amp; Julia Stewart
<br/>*<br/> 
We saw them again the next day (Saturday) at<b> 11:30am</b> when we were out on our sailboat. All three together again. Once again the male was close to one of the females and the other female seemed to be following behind. They were out in front of <b>downtown Port Orchard</b> heading towards the Bremerton shipyard.
<br/>Doug Miller   
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Pod of nine Orca whales</b> seen <b>in Case Inlet</b>. Many boats followed the whales and observed them for hours. I was on land too far away to see to identify even though I had binoculars. They sure seemed to be having fun.
<br/>Susie Cover   
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Grapeview Washington</b> - <b>10+ orcas</b> sighted on Saturday morning. 
<br/>*<br/>
Here are a couple photos of the <b>orcas </b>that were near <b>Bremerton</b>. It was amazing seeing them patrolling the bay! A group of transient orcas, or killer whales (Orcinus orca) swim back and forth near several uneasy sea lions, in front of the Bremerton Naval Station, near Seattle, Washington.  
<br/>William Byrne Drumm.
<br/>*<br/>
I've attached some photos taken Saturday <b>late afternoon</b>, beginning at the entrance of <b>Hammersley Inlet</b> during the incoming tide. It was a group of perhaps 6 who were splashing/tail slapping from the entrance to just past Cape Horn, after which they all seemed to become focused on heading <b>towards Shelton</b> in unison. Later that evening, what appeared to be the same number were heading north through <b>Pickering Passage</b>, between Squaxin Island and Hungeford Point, towards the Harstin Island Bridge, grouped in a line on the outgoing tide. 
<br/>Jules Michel   
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:00 AM - Pod of 7-8 Orcas</b> sighted on <b>Pickering Passage</b>, North of the Hartstene Island bridge. They traveled north into <b>Case inlet past Stretch and Treasure islands</b> toward Allyn. Appeared to be 1-2 calves and one larger male with a grey patch/marking behind the dorsal. The group appeared to be feeding (salmon? - the run to the hatchery at the head of Case inlet may be coming through), lots of tail slapping, breaching and rolling around.
<br/>Tim Thomsen  
<br/>*<br/>  
I saw many boaters stopping in their tracks to see the <b>Orcas</b>. My family also saw the whales surface for many hours throughout the morning. We live on high bank waterfront on <b>Bainbridge Island </b>a mile south of Fletchers Bay with views a<b>cross Port Orchard Bay to Brownsville Marina, Kitsap Co</b>. I went down to the beach for an early morning row on Saturday. I was standing in ankle deep water at <b>7:01am</b>. The sun had not yet reached the water surface. All was very quiet. The water was like glass. I counted <b>three Orca</b>s surface and breathe. The second I heard the inhale and exhale there was no doubt I was visited by a very large mammal.  The six foot tall dorsal fin confirmed it for me  The largest of the three I estimate was 25 feet long  Maybe bigger. Big enough I had no interest in rowing over for a closer look. I left well enough alone and had a wonderful long row.
<br/>John Christiansen
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3-4 transients</b> came a-visiting to <b>Boiling Reef</b> (located just off East Point on Saturna Island). I'm told the male in the group was <b>T19B </b>although I haven't confirmed that yet. Anyway, this is the bull in the group. He is bearing down on a clump of kelp in the foreground where a seal is hiding (or attempting to). You can see its head and back flippers. I don't know the outcome because I got distracted by a female transient that came back to see what T19B was doing. I didn't even know there was a seal in the shot until I looked at it on my laptop later that evening! However, I'm guessing it did not end well for the seal.
<br/>Valerie Shore
<br/>*<br/>
Just letting you know that there were <b>three transient orca whales around Snake Island, just off Nanaimo</b>, at approx <b>10am</b>. They circumnavigated the small island, which is famous for lots of seals. Looking at the fin markings, they are transient family <b>T10 female 'Langara', T10B male 'Siwash', and T10C juvenile 'Bones'</b>. They were there for 15 minutes, then swam back out into Georgia Strait (maybe the incoming ferry noise made them leave?)  We did not see them make a kill.

<b>Between 3 and 4 p.m.</b> - saw<b> approximately 20 orcas</b> including one calf off <b>Brook's Point, South Pender Island</b>. They were spread out, doing tail flips looking for food.  They turned and headed back towards the San Juan Islands.

We were boating in the San Juan Islands and <b>near Roche Harbor</b>. We decided to head south to Friday Harbor around <b>3pm </b>and encountered an amazing number of <b>Orcas</b>. I'm not kidding when I say there must have been <b>30+ Orcas</b> - they were every where!! They were of all sizes and different size fins. It was impossible getting around them. Just when you thought you were out of their way, boom - more Orcas!!! Many of them were tail slapping and breaching. They made their way <b>from the north of the Islands to Friday Harbor</b> and continued south.

<br/>*<br/>
The <b>orcas </b>were heading south <b>into Budd Inlet</b>. They almost immediately turned around and headed back out, <b>between 8:20 and 8:28</b>. I saw them by Cooper Point, heading north in front of the lighthouse at Boston Harbor. There were adults and young. They never surfaced at the same time so I couldn't get the numbers of all of them. I did see <b>at least 6 </b>at the same time while looking through binos. There were "large" ones leading the pod - and my husband, Scott, said they were bulls. Scott counted at least 8. My neighbor counted at least 10.

A group of <b>at least six whales</b> came through <b>Hamersley Inlet to Oakland Bay around 5:00 PM</b>. They were moving pretty quickly through the area, sounding for 20 minutes at a time. They look to be female with some young, no large dorsal fins. They headed north into Oakland Bay.

It was easy, maybe too easy, finding killer whales today. We headed up north from Friday Harbor, and <b>just east of Spieden Island</b> we encountered <b>both K and L pods</b>. They were everywhere around us! Breaching, spy hopping, and tail slapping. After watching them for a while, we headed back south towards Cattle Point and we headed back into the harbor we encountered the killer whales again! And they were still being super active! We saw at least six more breaches. I was also able to identify <b>Mega from L-pod</b>.

I bet that some others will report the beautiful scene today watching <b>J Pod swimming north up Haro Strait</b> as they passed Turn Pt./Stuart I. light and went as far as South Pender I.'s SW shore then turned to go south. We watched them from <b>1345 to 1515</b> hours.
There was a<b> humpback</b> in the vicinity, as well, that was entangled in some fishing gear. As we left, the orcas were spread out in arc of about 120 degrees around the humpback; distance of various individual orcas to HB =  100 yards to approximately 1/3 mile. Verrrry interesting!
Sound Watch was doing their normal great service with the private boaters nearby. Strait Watch was tracking the humpback and Fisheries staff arrived on scene about 1500.
We heard they were all going to attempt to cut the gear loose from the whale.

We had heard about the animal earlier in the day. We kept our distance and didn't stop to watch the single whale, as it was entangled in fishing gear and there were boats around with the hopes of untangling it from the line.

We saw <b>two humpbacks off of Guemes island</b> while we were out with Deer Harbor Charters. They were swimming in sync, and in fairly shadow water, often swimming close to the island. One had a large notch in his dorsal fin, and our naturalist suspected it may have been a prop injury. Underneath side of the tail was primarily white.

I was out at <b>Washington Park (Anacortes)</b> today doing my weekly Harbor Porpoise survey. We survey Burrows Pass, the water between Washington Park and Burrows Island. I not only saw two groups of Harbor Porpoise but just as I was ready to leave I heard a blow that could not have come from a harbor porpoise. When I looked there were <b>two Humpback Whales</b> entering the pass. I could clearly see their dorsal fin and as they made their turn around Borrows Island they were kind enough to wave with their Flukes. One appeared to be smaller then the other. Of course I did not have my camera with me. The larger one's fluke was mostly white on the underside and the smaller one had a little white on the underside of each tip of its fluke. Pass is deep but could not believe Humpbacks would come so close to land.  
<br/>PS:  The other thing I noticed, their blowhole and dorsal fin appeared to have a white coating on them.  Normal?

Headed out <b>between Shaw and Lopez Islands</b>, past Orcas and out towards Lummi Island, we were in search of the ever-popular but very elusive (in the Pacific Northwest) <b>humpback whale</b>. We saw boats out by Lummi. And then, we saw a blow!  And then another. But wait, there was another set of blows! We had not one but <b>two humpback whales</b>! As we continued to view the humpbacks, we noticed that one appeared a little smaller than the other; did we have a mother and almost-yearling calf?  The larger whale would breathe for about 4-5 cycles and then fluke-up dive and then the smaller one would follow suite. Perhaps two juveniles, teens hanging out. Before we could get too far, though, we saw lots of small gray bodies porpoising (bringing part of their bodies up) out of the water. <b>Harbor porpoises</b>!

While sitting at <b>Lime Kiln</b> waiting for whales to come down from the north, I was surprised at <b>1:15 PM </b>when whales suddenly came up from the south! It was the <b>L2s and L54s</b>, presumably going north to meet the other whales. These seven whales just passed the point north of Lime Kiln, then just milled back and forth around until the other whales approached. Around 2:00 PM, whales started coming back south.<b> K20 and K38</b> passed close to shore, with <b>K27 and K44</b> a little further off. Some whales were out at least a mile or two offshore, but before <b>3:00 PM</b> another big group passed about 200 yards offshore. IDs were difficult due to the backlighting, but I saw members of the following matrilines in this group:<b> J14s, L55s, L47s, and L26s</b>. If all members of those family groups were there, that's 23 whales, which seems about right for how many were traveling together.

I was fishing off <b>Sandy Point (Whidbey Island) </b>at dawn on Saturday morning and heard a large blow. I was able to catch sight of what looked like a lone <b>humpback </b>making its way north up <b>Saratoga Passage closer to Camano Island</b>. It was dead still and quiet and I was able to hear the whale making its whale sounds (not sure what you call that), but it was very cool. A couple of hours later I saw it again coming back south and this time got a clear look and was able to confirm it was a humpback by the small dorsal.

We had a pod of of <b>orcas </b>a whopping 18 miles west out of <b>Moss Landing, Monterey Bay CA</b>. Nancy Black confirmed the pod as <b>CA39s</b>. There was only CA39 and her offspring-- no adult male in the pod. When we got there there were mini-rafts of sea lions grouped together sticking their flippers out of the water. We would see the pod swim toward the rafts and dive under. A few seconds later, the sea lions panicked and took off porpoising east. We saw them charge at a sea lion but then continued west. Nancy said they had killed a sea lion about a half hour earlier.

<br/><i>Northern Resident Orca</i>
<br/>At least 8 Orca were around Arrow Passage and slowly heading towards Fife Sound. Some dolphins decide to harass them for a short time. They were very spread out from the Holford Islets and worked their way towards Wells Passage/Polkinghorne Island area. I dropped the hydrophone and immediately recognized some G-Clan calls. I left them around Polkinghorne Island 11 am headed West towards Numas Islands, Queen Charlotte Strait. Some Resident Orca by Naka Creek, other Resident Orca at the Broken Group as far as Forward Bay.

We ended up at the south end of <b>Saturna </b>to catch up with <b>L pod</b>, headed north. They were cruising up the east side of the island. When we got there they were moving at a slowish speed, which was great because we were able to catch up to them before they headed out into the Strait of Georgia. We were there for maybe 5 minutes when suddenly, things started to escalate. They sped up and started porpoising, occasionally surfacing simultaneously in beautiful "chorus lines" 6 or 7 whales across.  We motored offshore of the whales, trying to keep pace.  Apparently the whales had other ideas. They always do. A few of them turned in our direction. The captain quickly maneuvered the boat away, farther offshore, but we were met by more sneaky whales coming in toward our stern. Again we turned and tried to move farther offshore. No dice. A third group of whales surfaced outside of us. We were surrounded. We shut down to let the whales pass. These whales did not appear to be interested in us, just the area we were in. I was expecting them to pass as usual, but instead they slowed and started milling around us. No one was particularly close, just milling on all sides of the boat. Perhaps there were salmon hiding under us?  We sat, watching and listening to their forceful exhalations. We saw L25 (Ocean Sun) cruise by. We also saw a couple of the little L pod calves scooting around. We dropped the hydrophone and heard some faint calls.

Early reports of<b> "lots" of whales </b>in <b>San Juan Channel</b>. Turns out it was <b>J Pod, K Pod, AND L Pod</b>. The whales cruised by <b>Friday Harbor and headed towards Cattle Point</b>, where they decided to split apart. L Pod continued out to the west side of San Juan while Js and Ks (and apparently the L2s) turned and headed back north. We caught up with the whales during our afternoon trip in one of my favorite areas in <b>Boundary Pass--Monarch Head</b>. The whales had been breaching for quite awhile before we arrived, so they were in a bit of resting mode. That is until a huge container ship threw a huge wake across the front of about 20 orcas and they decided to play in the wake and began breaching over and over.  Tons of tail lobs, cartwheels, a few spyhops. All with Mt. Baker in the background.  More Js and Ks were swimming along the shoreline and doing a lot of foraging. We watched J27 Blackberry do multiple tail lobs as he chased after a female (who was swimming upside down so I couldn't get an ID). We also spotted K21 Cappucino and also little K44 (so peachy colored you couldn't miss the little guy!) It was nice seeing all the boats giving the whales space (except for one private sailboat who Soundwatch had to intercept as they passed between our boat and a nice group of whales). All the surface activity of the last few weeks had us pondering if the whales are so active because they are getting enough salmon to eat? As we prepared to leave, one female gave us a beautiful parting gift of a perfectly lit breach.

It was bright and sunny as we headed north out of <b>Friday Harbor</b>. We spotted a few killer whale dorsal fins off in the distance. As the boat turned there was a <b>large pod of orcas</b>, over twenty whales close to each other surfacing and breathing. Then, all of a sudden one breached, then another next to the first one, then a third after the second one, then two whales breached at the same time! It looked like it was coordinated. The whales continued to be super active and playful throughout the time we watched them; spy hopping, tail slapping, lob tailing, and occasionally more breaching!

My husband and I were walking the <b>South Beach</b>, San Juan Island around <b>1:30pm</b> and spotted <b>2 Orcas swimming West</b>. We walked over to a secluded group of rocks on the same beach and <b>watched a very large pod of about 20 - 25 Orcas</b>, including 1 large male with an intense dorsal fin protruding in and out of the water. The entire scene was mindblowing. We then drove to a lookout point about <b>a mile East of the Lime Kiln State Park</b>, crawled on a lower group of rocks and watched the same pod come through. We watched them breach and lobtail. Such amazing creatures. The only bothersome part of the entire viewing experience was the fact that every time a whale popped out of the water, a crowd of whale watching ships stalked the whale and pod. This was our first trip to San Juan Island but definitely not the last.

Something rare occurred today; killer whales surprised us by coming up not only next to our boat, but a couple swam under our boat! We headed around Cattle Point to the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. This is where we saw the orcas. There was a small group of three that were close to land. We stopped or boat to watch when one big male changed direction and the next thing we knew he swam right across our bow. I was able to identify him as <b>Blackberry (J27)</b>. Then more killer whales started coming to us from both directions. We watched them tail slapping and milling around, and we even saw <b>the new K-calf (K44) with his mother Deadhead (K27)</b>. Then, out of nowhere a group of 4 whales went around and under the boat next to us and then two swam under our boat! It was incredible! On the other side when they came up I was able to identify <b>Mike (J26)</b>. This was the closest encounter I've had! What a great summer afternoon.

This morning between <b>11:15 and 11:30</b> [<b>orcas</b>] headed south past <b>Lime Kiln</b> in a large, fast-moving group. When they were still a mile or more to the north they started getting very active - I think I saw about 15 breaches in the span of about 30 seconds! I've never seen them quite go off like that before. They settled down a little bit by the time they reached the lighthouse, but we still saw several breaches, spyhops, and tailslaps. I saw members from every matriline in J-Pod plus L87, but there were so many whales I think at least some of K-Pod was present, too.

We made our way along the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. Suddenly, someone shouted, "There!" The boat slowed, we turned, we looked, we waited and then: ORCA! One dorsal and then two appeared. They were traveling north so we meandered along with them; they led us to more whales and less fog, perfect! We started seeing more and more; we were able to identify many from <b>K-pod including K-27 "Deadhead"</b> (referring more to a dangerous vertically-bobbing log than a music groupie) and her baby, K44 (yet to be named). Lots of whales in the common hunting formation of trios, pairs and loners. The whales dropped us off at Mosquito Pass, at least that's where the end--the trailers--of the pod was. This allowed us to cut through between Henry Island and San Juan, pass Roche Harbor and ultimately circumnavigate San Juan Island (no more fog on this side!).

We headed towards Victoria to try and find the elusive <b>Humpback Whale</b>. The last reports we heard were of two animals that had just 'fluked up' and gone for a deeper dive. So we slowly moved into the area, turned off the engines, and waited. After only a few short minutes we had <b>two mature Humpbacks</b> surface not far from the boat side by side. We watched as they each took a few breaths, spouting about 15 feet in the air, and then getting great shots of a double fluke as the dove again. We repositioned the boat and waited for the next surfacing. As we scanned all the around, I heard passengers from another boat gasp in excitement and I turned just in time to see both Humpbacks completely breach out of the water!! Our other boat, the Sea Lion, was between us and the whales, but one of the Humpbacks got so much air that I could see it over the top of the other boat. It was Incredible! Humpbacks are some of my favorite whales in the world.

Another <b>NE Florida orca</b> report from August 9: My family stayed <b>at the beach in St Augustine FL</b>. We were out a little further than normal so the kids could use floats. I saw a huge amount of fish jumping out of the water so i started looking to see what was making them move. When my daughter started screaming shark. I looked to the left where she was trying to get out of the water. I knew it wasn't a shark because of its fin it look like an orca (juvenile), but <b>I was looking at it and it was looking at me</b>. I was shocked because my mind was saying you don't belong here. Have you had any sightings in St Augustine Fl? (<i>Yes, on August 1 from New Smyrna FL and on August 6 in St. Augustine FL</i>). We did hear of other people saying they saw whales. My daughter was right next too it and I was close enough to look into its face. I'll never forget the eyes.

Very unusual sighting today...a <b>humpback</b>! It was right on the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. We saw the spout followed by its large back. We watched for a while and were able to see it go down for two deeper dives, arching its back and exposing its fluke. Plus, when it exhaled, it sounded like it was wheezing because it made a high pitched, scratchy sound. That wasn't all that we saw today.

Off the <b>west side of San Juan</b> we watched a group of juveniles splashing and playing for about 10 minutes before we realized what the focus of their attention was. It became clear when this youngster appeared with the latest in orca hat fashion? a salmon! 
<br/>Val Shore.
<br/>*<br/>
Members of<b> J, K &amp; L pods</b> passed by <b>Lime Kiln from 8-11am</b>, first heading north and then back south again. J8 put on a bit of a show with several breaches. Many cartwheels and a few tail lobs from some of the others. Members present included J2 &amp; K12.

<b>Two killer whales</b> came up real close to our boat! Then a few more surfaced all around us and one even breached! They slowly started moving away from us, but Mike stayed close for a little while longer. The group was in no hurry though, taking the time to tail slap and turn over, slapping the water with their pectoral fins. I was able to identify J26 (Mike) as well as L72 (Racer) from this group. We found more killer whales, lots of them! We slowed and watched a group of about four whales tail slapping, rolling around, and spy hopping. Then to the other side of the boat there were juveniles porpoising and breaching. The groups started coming together and there were now maybe twenty whales, one of which was obviously <b>L41 </b>(Mega).

This morning just after <b>8 AM</b> I arrived at <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b> and whales were already going by heading north. The first whale I saw was <b>L2, and L88</b> was offshore of her. The whales were very spread out and going on long dives which made them hard to track. Between 8 and 9 o'clock I also saw <b>L22 and L79, K22 and K37, and the L54s</b>. While these whales continued north, at 9 I could see a large group of whales heading south past Land Bank, as well.

We saw a <b>large pod of orcas</b>, at <b>9:30 am</b> at Columbia Beach, French Creek (northern <b>Georgia Strait</b>, about 20 miles north of Nanaimo, BC). There were <b>at least a few hundred</b>, heading south.

This afternoon at <b>1:15 PM</b> a very spread out <b>superpod </b>started making their way south past <b>Lime Kiln</b>. J2 was in the lead, followed by the J14s, the K13s, and K12s. Many whales were several miles offshore, way too far away to be identified. There was a gap from 2:00-2:30, when another group of whales came by. I'm not 100% sure because they were so backlit but given the number of juveniles and the dorsal fin shapes, I'm guessing it was the L55s, and it looked like L47 and L115 were also there. When I left around 3:00 there was still a large group of whales hanging out in the middle of Haro Strait, slowly making their way south.

<br/><b>2:05 PM - ORCA AT LIME KILN</b>
<br/>robo
<br/>Whistles being heard on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones, 3:05 pm</b> - Lon Brockelhurst reported hearing calls at 2:04 pm at Lime Kiln as well.
<br/>3:30pm - Watched members of K &amp; L (and possibly J) pods pass by Lime Kiln from 1-3pm. Estimated 45-50+ individuals. Amazing!

Arrived at <b>Lime Kiln at 9:30 to see a large portion of the J, K, L</b> pods pass heading north. The last group was large in numbers and much closer to the shore. One headed right in along the kelp line. ID's from our photos include: non-wound side of K21 (Cappucino); K40 (Raggedy); K16 (Opus; K22 (Seiku); J34 (Doublestuff); J22 (Oreo).

Spent the <b>afternoon </b>with <b>L's</b> at <b>Pender</b>. We i.d'd Gaia, Wavewalker, Tanya, Ino, Nyssa and Indigo...we think. The boys for definite! Haven't double checked the ladies yet. There was a really little calf in there aswell. They were resting at first and then all woke up and started feeding and socializing.

<b>Transients off Tofino, T41, T41a and very young calf</b> found at <b>2pm </b>around Cleland Island, SE of Flores Island off Tofino. Jamies whale watching zodiacs were watching these animals as well as grays and humpbacks well into the evening.

We went international to observe a pod rumored to be around the <b>Gulf Islands</b> of Canada. Shortly after crossing the border and entering Swanson Channel we saw a group of around <b>fifteen lively orcas</b>. The surface around them was turning with activity as Mickey Mouse ear pectoral fins slapped the surface, full-body breaches created wakes and tails slammed onto the water. There were three mature males within the mix and the two that were traveling closely together appeared to be the <b>brothers Wave Walker (L-88) and Gaia (L-78) of the L2 matriline</b>.

We watched the <b>L's (at least 20-25)</b> from land, a little bit north at <b>Hannah Heights</b> area from <b>7:00-7:30 am</b>. Exuberant socializing, foraging, tail lobs (many in succession of 3-4), spyhops, lunging, rolls, love, breaches. The sound of their blows heard from way up on the bend at Bailer HIll/West Side Road. Was an amazing 1/2 hour. When we left, they were heading south again at about Pile Point.
<br/><b>5:35pm</b> update: We stayed at Lime Kiln all day, none of the Orca that way. Last reports from Bob Otis at the lighthouse: was L's came through the Juan de Fuca Strait and hooked up with the L12's near <b>Salmon bank</b>, (South Beach) earlier and were still there, possibly heading north. <b>J's &amp; K's last reported off of Lummi Island</b> late this afternoon, heading south.

<br/>*<br/> 
The <b>killer whales</b> were close today so we had plenty of observation time and were able to see a smorgasbord of species. We first encountered L pod and successfully identify the 34-year-old male Mega (L-41) who was traveling alongside the 22-year-old male Gaia (L-78). What was really exciting was the amount of calves that were traveling and playing together. There were at least three youngsters who were taking turns lob tailing, propoising, spy hopping and breaching next to each other. After spending our fair share of time with the killer whales, <b>minke whales</b> were next out by <b>Salmon Bank</b>. There were two whales which surfaced more frequently than normal and surprised us by coming up right next to the boat, close enough to hear them breathe.

We've had <b>L-pod</b> all day, <b>juan de fuca</b> in the <b>morning</b>, <b>salmon bank</b> in the <b>afternoon</b>, last seen milling at <b>False Bay</b>.

<br/>*<br/> 
I heard <b>echolocation </b>at <b>Lime Kiln</b> for a while this <b>morning</b>, and a lot of loud boats came and lingered, screeching into the hydrophone, so I'm assuming the orcas were there even though I didn't hear any vocalizations.

Fab morning with<b> J's and K's</b>!! J34's getting bigger each time I see him. Was lovely to see K21, and his interesting new nick! and J27 was much fun in the afternoon with his inverted swimming!
<br/>Mercedes Powell
<br/>*<br/>
We headed north into <b>Canadian waters</b> to find the <b>killer whales</b>. Three of them came up on us, about one hundred yards away! It was K pod; we were able to identify Cappuccino. We watched them slowly move near shore and meet up with other whales. As we were watching the whales, salmon began to jump out of the water.

Sitting here at <b>San Juan County park</b>. The <b>Orca </b>were at LK earlier and passed by here about an hour ago (<b>noon</b>). First heard what I thought was K pod on Lime Kiln hydrophone around 11:00 am. Overheard someone here saying it was J and some K's. Several groups travelling thru steadily north with some breaches. They continued up the north end of the island out of sight. Very appreciative that J &amp; K pod journeyed back along San Juan Island.

A fast, but happy, whale show past our Orca Rock on a gorgeous afternoon around <b>5 pm</b>. <b>Js </b>swimming with the fast tide, east through <b>Active Pass</b>. Many tail slaps, spy hops, breaches, backstroke swimming, and fin slaps.

We spotted 2 Orca just off Mack Arch rock south of <b>Crook Point in Oregon</b> at about <b>10:30 a.m</b>. We have stayed at this particular location many times and have found that it is a haven for summer resident gray whales. This year we observed a juvenile gray whale each day traveling north and south to the inside of the sea stacks where there is good protection from rough waters and predators. The grays have remained in this general area feeding for days at a time during our stays. Our sighting lasted less than 10 min and they disappeared behind the large rock and were not viewed again by us.

We saw what looks to be the same L subgroup. At <b>3:45 pm</b> near <b>Hannah Heights</b> area we were watching first 5 Orca (1 adult male, 3 females and a youngin) heading steadily south. Once they passed, another adult male and a female followed quite a distance behind. I almost think this male looks like L41 so look forward to any reports from the boats for all the ID's. All 7 were mostly foraging and slow moving south, with a few tail slaps, porpoising and one spyhop. We watched them from the bluff until <b>5:30pm</b>.
From <b>6:00-7:00pm</b> we watched them from <b>South Beach</b>, mostly foraging and moving east, then west, then east, then west. When we left them they were heading pretty steadily west. Maybe another day, they will come back in close to the lighthouse.

<br/>*<br/> 
Joe Huckaba reported a pod of <b>7-8 orcas </b>seen near <b>Brookings, OR</b> at <b>12:30pm</b>. They were a couple of miles from shore at N42 12 103 by W124 25 407, headed SSW. They were "playing more than feeding.
<br/>*<br/> 
We received a call from Marlene Wagenheim of Florida, reporting <b>an orca she saw 3-400 yards off the beach in New Smyrna Beach, Florida</b> (about 40 miles northeast of Orlando) at 2pm. She didn't think it was an adult male. It breached 3 times. She said she heard others had been seen there a few weeks ago, but she couldn't find a reliable report.

Hi all-<b>2:15 pm</b> from <b>South Beach</b> we saw the <b>L12's</b> (ID from LK Int. Center) foraging out a couple hundred yards or more. They then headed north, last around False bay at 4:00. Yay! More to come we hope.

<b>L-pod, minke</b>. Out into the waters off <b>Salmon bank</b>, where the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Haro strait meet, we found exactly what we were still holding our breaths for: <b>L-pod </b>of the Southern Resident Killer Whales! The pod was spread out near and off shore and <b>from Cattle Pass up towards False Bay</b>. It was every whale for itself, with a few being social and in pairs and trios. Some seemed to be traveling, others hunting and one frisky pair may have been mating (was he an outsider from J or K pod?). They were heading south but after thirty minutes of viewing, they all of a sudden went offshore and started traveling north. The visibility was excellent (we could see Mount Rainier and Mount Baker!). We found "bird balls" (high densities of birds sitting on the water, potentially on a ball of bait fish like herring). One bird ball took off all at once and minutes later, we found out why: a <b>minke whale</b> had come in to eat their herring!

<br/>*<br/> 
Courtney Smith called Orca Network to say <b>J pod</b> is heading west out the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> this morning from <b>7 to 7:45 am</b>. She saw J27, J19 and J41 from Port Angeles with a spotting scope, about ten kilometers from shore.
