<b>11:27 - Humpback off deception pass state park</b> southbound.
<br/>Deception Pass Tours
<br/>*<br/>
Karen Morton called to <b>10 am</b> with a report of <b>1 or 2 gray whales </b>on the east side of <b>Port Susan</b>, at Country Club, headed south after feeding for about an hour. She said this is the first time she's seen one so far north in Port Susan.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 29, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Orca Network received a phone message from Roger Freel relaying a report of <b>at least 15 orcas off Westport, WA at 1700</b> between the #2 buoy and the mouth of Grays Harbor.
<br/>*<br/>
<a href="http://www.cascadiaresearch.org/">Cascadia Research</a> undertook a survey out of <b>Westport, Washington</b>, and encountered a group of <b>~25 southern resident killer whales</b> including individuals from <b>both K and L pods</b>. The whales were traveling rapidly to the north. We were able to photograph many of the individuals present and the photos are being sent to the Center for Whale Research and Northwest Fisheries Science Center to confirm identity of those whales present.
<br/>H<i>ere is the list from the Cascadia Westport encounter:</i> <b>K12, K13, K14, K20, K25, K26, K27, K34, K36, K37, K38, K42, K43, K44, L5, L25, L27, L41, L53, L55, L72, L79, L82, L84, L85, L86, L89, L91, L94, L103, L105, L106, L109, L113, L116, L118.</b>

<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:33 p.m. - </b>I believe I may have seen an <b>orca</b>. Solid black with very defined arch when it surfaced out of the water. I saw something black out of the corner of my eye and then saw it surface in rapid succession twice, and then once more about 15 minutes later further south. It did not have a large dorsal fin. It was not a humpback, gray whale, or dolphin. Off of <b>Joseph Whidbey State Park beach in Oak Harbor, WA</b>, traveling south.
<br/>Elisabeth Murray
<br/>*<br/>
We saw everything and it felt like we went everywhere today. After being on the water for over an hour a whale report came to Capt. Bill that the [<b>orcas</b>] were in <b>Haro Strait</b> near Canada parallel with the Lime Kiln lighthouse. Leaving Speiden Island we headed back to Haro Strait. On a mission to catch up with the whales, we nearly missed several Dall's porpoises foraging on the north side of Kelp Reef. Soon after, we caught up with a group of <b>approximately 6 Transient Orcas whales near Kelp Reef</b>. 
<br/>Naturalist Shelly, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
My husband and I were in the South Sound (<b>Case Inlet</b>) and saw <b>a whale</b> today around noon. We couldn't tell if it was a grey what or a humpback. We saw it moving North toward Allyn and since there's no outlet going that way we thought we would see it going South but we never did. It was a very cool experience!

<br/>*<br/>
One <b>gray whale between Gedney Island and Camano Head at 11:30</b> this morning.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:30 am -</b> A call came in that <b>at least 3 Orca</b>, all small fins were spotted off Atrevida Reef just North of <b>Powell River</b> and Sliammon headed towards Powell River.
<br/>Kim Liseberg (sp?), Savary Island/Lund
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12 pm At least 4 Orca</b> which included at least one large male, were taking their time moving slowly Southward off Sliammon.
<br/>Steve Grover, <b>Powell River</b>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1 pm - </b>The first whale watching tour found the <b>Orca </b>just off Sliammon Creek, <b>Powell River</b>. There were <b>7 whales</b> including at least one small calf. Later, over the radio, it was confirmed that they had <b>at least 8 whales with 2 calves and T02C</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient Orca T02C, Harwood Island</b>
<br/>Nick Templeman, Eagle Eye Adventures
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:30 pm -</b> Lee waited with the <b>Transient Orca</b> till Jen, <b>Campbell River</b> Whale Watching got on scene close in to Harwood Island and starting to pick up the pace a bit towards Rebecca Rocks, half way between Harwood and Texada Islands. They again stalled and soon after, Nick Templeman, Eagle Eye Adventures arrived on scene. He was with them till a bit after <b>4:15 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
We had an amazing day with this Gang of <b>Orca </b>today. There were <b>8 animals</b> in Total, my rusty eyeballs can pick out <b>T02C and T02C2 and T02C3</b> I think it is?! The rest I am leaving in your capable hands. (No time to check them all or send them off for verification yet - SM) 
<br/>Nicklaus, Eagle Eye Adventures
<br/>*<br/>
Maureen Fredericks reported <b>6 orcas at Klahanie</b> (about 5 miles northwest of Powell River, BC)

Maureen Fredericks reported <b>2 orcas at Klahanie</b> (about 5 miles northwest of Powell River, BC)
<br/><br/>
<b>April 28, 2012</b>
<br/><br/> 
A few <b>orcas </b>did their own Tour de Lopez this afternoon coming past the <b>south end of Lopez</b>. A small, slow-moving, tightly packed pod of <b>5 - 7 orcas</b> traveled east past Iceberg Point, turned and headed out further in the Strait in a westerly drift with at least a dozen boats in pursuit.  
<br/>Sally Reeve
<br/>*<br/>
One day the Residents, and the next the Transients, and then the Residents and then the Transients...We are soon to finish the best April that I can remember for Orca sightings.  Orcas have been seen about two out of three days this April. Amazing. Yesterday it was the <b>Ts off of Iceberg Pt. Lopez Island</b>, with the Cascade Mts. in the background. We left them late, headed in the direction of Deception Pass
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
We encountered a group of <b>about 12 transients Orcas, including T49As &amp; Bs</b>, at <b>Iceberg Pt</b> on our trip this afternoon. These are the same transients we encountered about a month ago hunting seals near Yellow Island. Today, they were grouped tightly together in a resting pattern.
<br/>Captain Brian Goodremont and Naturalist Kevin Culmback, San Juan Outfitters
*<br/>
While I cannot identify them, I (and my flight-mates) saw a number of <b>orcas (more than 6) in San Juan Channel off Fishermen's Bay on Lopez, Saturday noon</b>. We were flying in on a Kenmore float plane.
<br/>Tim Blanchard 
<br/>*<br/>
SUPER CLOSE <b>KILLER WHALES</b> from the Ocean Explorer off of <b>Newport Beach, California</b>!! Capt. Larry Hartmann saw <b>5 orcas; 30 more passed</b> by a bit later!
<br/>Alisa Schulman-Janiger
<br/>*<br/>
<b>KILLER WHALE</b> ALERT! The Island Packers, (<b>Monterey Bay CA</b>) saw <b>12-16 killer whales</b> today...spending over 5 hours with them! At least 4 of these were from the <b>CA51 </b>family!! These can be super-friendly...we saw them on Monterey Bay Whale Watch on 4 days between April 12 and April 20!! The last two days we saw the, they were EXTREMELY active...HOURS of BREACHING, SPYHOPPING, LOBTAILING, SURFING, RACING, CLOSE-TO-BOAT, VOCALIZING...incredible whales, my favorite transients!! WOW! Orca soup!
<br/>Alisa Schulman-Janiger
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>today in the <b>Santa Barbara CA channel</b>, Steve has the pics, i think they are the same pod we saw 4/9 up here, the male with the slight bend in the top of the dorsal fin. It was an amazing time with them!
<br/>Anthony Lombardi
<br/><i>Alisa Schulman-Janiger: THE <b>CA51s</b>..my favorite transients!!</i>

<b>Grey whale </b>sighting - going south from <b>Sandy Point</b> toward the ferry dock.!:)
<br/>Sue Green VanGiesen
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:10am -</b> not sure if same whale, but feeding in same spot
<br/><b>7:35am -</b> still feeding S. Bells Beach. Grabbing my camera to see if we can ID
<br/><b>7:00 - 7:18am -lone gray whale</b>  is stopping for snack at <b>Bells' Beach</b> 50yrds off beach moving very slowly towards <b>Langley</b>. est 30min to grab cup-o-joe, slippers and glasses to get out and ring the bell.
<br/>Kathy Carr
<br/>*<br/>
<b>09:19 PM - Transient Orca</b> are spending more time again close to Myrtle Rocks, just south of <b>Powell River</b>. This is the same group of <b>8 to 10 whales</b> including the two calves, <b>T02C and T20</b> that's been close to Powell River for most of April. There are lots of seals and sea lions in the area, so plenty to eat. Also below are some reports of Pacific White Sided Dolphins and Dall's Porpoise.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:40 am</b> A call came in from Steve Grover that there were <b>Orca </b>just off the ferry terminal in <b>Powell River</b> heading Southward. They started to breach, spy hop and do some great tail lobs. I could identify <b>T02C </b>immediately and saw the two calves porpoising close by. With all the birds above, I assume they were on some food. A couple more spy hops, breaches and tail lobs and they carried on towards Grief Point.
<br/>Susan Mackay
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:30 am - </b>Taking their time, the <b>Orca </b>made it past Myrtle Rocks and continued heading South towards Black (Albion) Point and Lang Bay. No amount of activity.
<br/>Bill Taylor, <b>Powell River</b>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:15 pm - Pod of Orca </b>just off Black (Albion) Point heading Northward towards Myrtle Rocks and <b>Powell River</b>. Two calves in the group close to females.
<br/>Nina Falls, Powell River
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>4:30 or 5 pm</b>: Thanks again for the call today, we really enjoyed seeing the <b>orca</b>. I tried to get some photos of their return trip (heading Northward). They were further off shore and doing long dives and milling around, so I guess they were feeding. No good show on the second viewing. 
<br/>Holly Roy, Powell River
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
We had the T<b>086A's with the T124A's and T049C</b> east bound heading towards<b> Race Rocks</b> in the <b>afternoon</b>.. Thanks to Russ from Sooke Coastal for the heads up.
<br/>Mark Malleson
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:05 pm - J and Ks</b> are back today, were spread out between <b>Eagle Point and Hannah Heights</b>. Sounds like they are headed out. Not to worry though they will be back soon.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
They [<b>orcas</b>] took a turn west when they got to <b>False Bay</b>. I was waiting at land bank.
<br/>Traci Walter
<br/>*<br/>
Calm seas, sunshine, and <b>ORCAS</b>! Upon leaving the harbor we traveled along the east side of San Juan Island and found members of the<b> J-Pod</b> at the <b>southern end of the island</b>. For much of our encounter, the whales were spread out over a large distance but would then regroup and spend time within close proximity of each other.
Whales were traveling, milling, and exhibited foraging behavior, although no fish were seen.  We heard amazing vocalizations using our underwater hydrophone; squeaks, squeals and percussive sounds.
<br/>Naturalists Colleen and Amy, San Juan Safaris 
<br/>*<br/>
It was SO cool to see these <b>three orcas, with Monterey Bay</b> Whale Watch! I've seen <b>CA20 </b>(adult male) and <b>CA54 </b>(adult female) before; they were first photographed together in Monterey Bay in 1987 - old timers! It was my first sighting of <b>CA177</b>, a younger female and relative newcomer, first seen in Monterey in 1997.
<br/>Alisa Schulman-Janiger
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Lots of <b>Orcas, Js and Ks, on the West Side</b>, and some of them went north in the evening. That means that we well could have them down here today again.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Humpback off Deception Pass, 4:30 pm.</b>

<b>9:40am - J Pod</b> on <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b>! thanks Cathy Bacon. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:23 am -</b> Thanks to a call from Jeanne Hyde and Breanna Walker hearing faint calls, Beam Reach students are observing <b>members of J pod heading north in Haro Strait</b>. First calls were heard by Jeanne at <b>7:15</b> and by Breanna at 7:20. I'm now beginning to hear clicks at Orcasound (5 km north of Lime Kiln) -- Speiden just passed the lighthouse, so they are pretty spread out.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:50 am -</b> Just got the call...Lots of <b>Orcas</b>...Js and most likely <b>Ks</b>, including Granny, <b>J2</b>, on the <b>West Side</b> headed north.
<br/>Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
Just watched <b>4-5 (+) female orcas</b> head north on the west side (of <b>San Juan island</b>) approx 1 mile offshore. Too far out to ID- they are heading towards LandBank as of <b>8:10am</b>.
<br/>Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I saw <b>a gray whale</b> yesterday around 6 pm in front of my house by <b>Boston Harbor, Olympia</b>. I think there was only one. It was going towards Olympia in the Budd Inlet.

<b>Humpback </b>right outside of <b>Open Bay, near Snug Harbor</b>, San Juan Island
Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
There is <b>a grey whale</b> hanging out at <b>Rosario Resort on Orcas Island</b>...been there a couple weeks or more. I CAN'T believe I just got word. Anyway, I didn't see it as it was a serious low tide and very windy, but my friend who told me did see it.

Saw <b>a dozen or so [<i>probable gray whale</i>] blows</b> from <b>Point No Point</b> between <b>3:30 and 4:15</b>. 
<br/>Lila Pharis
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:06 am</b> - Just saw a small grouping of <b>3-5 killer whales</b> off of <b>Eagle Pt on SJI</b> traveling North. There was one larger male in the group :). 
<br/>Brittany Helen
<br/>*<br/>
I received a call that <b>whales were passing Lime Kiln lighthouse</b> heading my way. I spotted transient orcas off Andrews Bay heading north at about <b>12:15</b>. They soon changed direction and headed back south. Out on Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon we met up with the same whales as they were heading offshore, <b>toward Hein Bank</b>. The whales present were <b>T49A, T49A1, T49A2, T49A3, T49B, T49B2, T65A, T65A2, T65A3 and T65A4</b>. They began porpoising and continued to do so as they changed direction heading east. We left them at <b>3:30</b> off <b>Iceberg Pt. Lopez Island </b>as they continued heading east.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
It wasn't until <b>Pile Point </b>before we caught up with <b>3 of the T-100's, including T101 and T102</b> (48°28'N, 123°05'W), traveling south from Pile Point off the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. <b>Another group of Transients</b> were reported behind us (<b>6 or 7</b>). We stayed with the T-100's till the Salmon Banks buoy before heading towards Cattle Pass and home. A stop at Whale Rocks gave us great viewing of hauled out <b>Stellar Sea lions</b> covering one end, while several more milled about in the water. And, just like yesterday, we found several groups of<b> Harbor Porpoises</b> foraging in San Juan Channel, between Lopez Island and Turn Island.

"Spouting News"
<br/>GRAY SKY GRAY SEA GRAY WHALE
<br/>On the way home from <b>Oak Harbor around 5:30PM</b>, got a call from a friend/neighbor that a gray whale was out front. When I arrived, <b>gray </b>was still feeding out front near the shore in calm gray waters, with gray skies. Everything gray. Activity included slow swirling with fins out of water, as the whale fed on sand/ghost shrimp. After a brief snack, gray headed pass Mariners Cove pilings/marina jetty entrance. Decided to go from beach to boat whale watcher. When I got out of the marina, the gray had turned and now was spouting/heading back/southwest towards Polnell Point. Picked up another friend on shore and we followed the gray. Gray was feeding almost the entire time we were out there. Usually hundred to 300 feet from shore. Slowly, moving and feeding; both perpendicular and vertically/straight out from beach. Head popping up, fins out of water, water churning, and spouting when necessary. We left the gray halfway between Mariners Cove and Polnell Point. Still feeding in changing windy conditions and a choppy sea. A timely treat on a truly "gray" day. 
<br/>Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor/Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>5:06</b> a neighbor and I spotted <b>a Gray whale</b> just south of <b>Strawberry Point</b> (east of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island). S/he was initially heading south, appeared to stop quickly at the local shrimp bed at Mariner's Cove, then turned and headed north.
<br/>Sandy Byers
<br/>*<br/>
Mary Jo Adams saw <b>a gray whale in Crescent Harbor at 2:40 pm</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 23, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>10:56 am -</b> Connie Barrett saw <b>a gray whale in Saratoga Passage</b> heading north about <b>1.5 miles from the Camano State Park</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Saw and followed <b>a grey whale just south of kayak point</b> (north of Everett) heading south <b>on 4/14</b> then today 4/23 watched and followed <b>two gray whales</b> just south of Warm Beach headed north up into <b>Port Susan</b> bay. 
<br/>David Westin Millard
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:00-13:00 -</b> We saw <b>possibly more than one Gray whale</b> (based on frequency of breath spouts) in the <b>Carr inlet </b>(south Puget Sound) between the Maple Hollow Park on the Key Peninsula and Horse Head Bay to the North and Fox Island to the South. It looked like feeding behavior with Fin out of the water and a lot of rolls, but I believe the water was fairly deep, as opposed to a tide flat.
<br/>John A. Campbell, MD
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:40 pm -</b> Brooke McKinley saw <b>a gray whale</b> in the western side of <b>Crescent Harbor</b> while the necropsy was underway on the east side of the bay on the gray whale that was found off Camano Island on April 22. Blows were seen until about <b>4 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>noon, two grays</b> passed by off shore from <b>Tulalip Shores</b>. They are heading north towards Spee-bi-dah. They don't seem to be feeding, but appear to be moving along with some purpose.
<br/>Vicki Mattson, Tulalip Shores
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Grey Whale</b> feeding just off the shelf this morning (west side of <b>Whidbey Island</b>)! Looks to be alone but will keep looking. Moving from North to South so someone may catch it at Sunset Beach later this morning.
<br/>Charles Niedzialkowski, LMHC, Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:15 - 9:00 am -</b> Fred Lundahl is watching <b>two gray whales</b> in the mudflats off <b>Langley</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
This morning I had the delight of being woken up at<b> 5:20 by a gray whale</b> feeding in front of my house, northwest of <b>Langley </b>(Saratoga Passage). The whale worked back and forth for 45 minutes before heading off to the north. I was not able to ID it.

Beam Reach students are observing<b> ~10 transients</b> passing the <b>Lime Kiln lighthouse northbound at 11:30</b> this morning. There are <b>two groups of ~4 and ~6</b>, including an adult male and 1-2 calves. As they passed the lighthouse a <b>Steller sea lion</b> was swimming quickly southward, breathing hard...

<br/>*<br/>
From <b>3:15 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. transient calls</b> were on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>. They started out faint, increased in volume, with lots of buzzing occurring at <b>3:30 a.m.</b> and at about the same time, I heard their calls for a few seconds on the Orca Sound hydrophones.

<br/>*<br/>
When we joined the <b>orcas </b>they were in <b>Haro Strait</b>, SE of Victoria, Canada. And they were headed west into open waters. It was a <b>part of J pod</b> that we were viewing - about 8 animals. They were in traveling mode. We watched the rhythmic up-for- air/down/travel/up-for-air. A youngster gave several tail slaps. And there were a few 'spy hops'. No vocalizations. We were all a bit mesmerized.

On Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the<b> K14s, J14s, J-8, J-19 and L-87</b>. A couple others were present but I wasn't able to get ID pictures of them. We left them a few miles south of Discovery Island heading in a westerly direction<b> at 2:40. At 6:39 pm</b> I heard Resident calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. They were faint, increased in volume for a few minutes and then became so faint I had to have my speakers turned all the way up to hear them. Their calls lasted for about 18 minutes.

<b>12:22pm - Four or more orca</b>, quite spread out, headed northwest past <b>Eagle Point</b> and presumably up the Haro. One came fairly close to shore here at the point, and others following at the same time were nearly a mile out. What a joy to hear, and see them, again!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>19:38pm </b>(approx) faint sound of calls on <b>lime kiln hydrophone</b>, two possible three distinct animals. Silenced by passing ship.

Josh Azevedo, a sport fisherman, called Orca Network to say that at <b>11:25 am</b> he had seen about <b>ten orcas</b>, 3 miles west of "the buoy" off <b>Ft.

Just to report a sighting of about <b>seven orca</b> at Myrtle Rocks this morning at <b>7:45 am</b>. They were heading south , taking long, long dives. What a great sight to wake up to!

<b>J pod</b> calls woke me up at <b>6:25 a.m.</b> Granny and her group were up ahead of the rest of the whales by a couple miles or more. <b>The rest of J pod - the J11s, J17s and J22s along with Cappuccino K-21, Raggedy K-40, Opus K-16 and Sonata K-35 were the trailing group</b>. I saw the K13s only once and was glad to see Deadhead K-27 and baby K-44. More of the day on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

UNKNOWN WHALE (probably <b>a gray whale</b>, see April 25 post). On both Saturday and Sunday in <b>East Sound Bay</b>, between <b>Olga and Obstruction Pass, Orcas Island</b>, we observed a solitary whale (humpback? gray? couldn't tell...) surfacing and moving slowly in the same general area. Couldn't tell the size since we were looking across the Bay from the White Beach area of Orcas. I was able to get numerous pictures of spouts and one picture actually captured the back as it surfaced - on blow up the whale looked extremely thin, with the spine quite prominent. We never saw a tail. We did see a head, though, and thought it looked like a humpback (which we have seen many times in Maui). At one point a fixed wing plane flew over the whale and circled him two or three times. The whale spent a good deal of time right on the surface from what we could tell at our distance. We first heard him spout on Saturday about 1000 and he disappeared about noon on Sunday. I thought you might want to know as he most likely is sick and may surface elsewhere in the San Juans... It is very unusual a whale is seen in this area (except maybe for rare orca).

<b>1:22AM -</b> Spotted <b>a single gray whale</b> feeding in <b>Carr Inlet</b>, about a half mile S.W. of Cutt's Island off Kopachuck State Park (south Puget Sound). We watched for 30 minutes as it stayed in the area coming up several times to breathe and then going into a dive. We where more than a mile away and could see the blows and hear then a second later. This was the first gray whale I have seen in that bay, we were very excited.

Natalie Bowes saw <b>orcas</b> from the <b>BC Ferry</b> from Vancouver today at <b>4:15</b>!
<br/>*<br/>
Today we took off with reports of our <b>resident orcas coming north on the west side of San Juan Island</b>. We made our way slowly into Haro Strait <b>between Henry Island and Stuart Island</b>. Up came dorsals. Out came whale breath. Over all there may have been<b> 15 - 20 animals</b>. They were traveling in small groups of 6 - 8 and it appeared to me that they were in a resting-style mode. Residents can be very vocal. No vocalizations today - we dropped the hydrophone three separate times. Residents can be very playful and energetic. None of that today. Lots of slow "up" and sinking back "down". The water was glass-like. No wind. No noise. It felt very peaceful bobbing in the water with the engine off.

Ken Balcomb just called to report that<b> J pod, K pod and L87</b> went north up San Juan Island this morning beginning around <b>6:30 am</b>. They headed north slowly in <b>Haro Strait</b>, working against the tide. When the tide changed, they started moving on, by about <b>3:20 pm</b> he believed they were up near Turn Pt, Stuart Island.

We found <b>gray whale #22</b> and with <b>another gray, southeast of Gedney Island</b> about halfway between Gedney and Everett, at <b>3:30pm</b>. After several deep dives showing their flukes, the whales logged on the surface, occasionally lifting a fluke out of the water.

We spotted a small boat with people leaning out watching something at about <b>11:30am</b>, just south of Oak Harbor. Then we spotted fins, and thought we had found some transient orcas. A closer look revealed them to be <b>Risso's dolphins</b>. I got a good look at the melon on one as it surfaced coming toward our boat, and one of them spyhopped, leaving no doubt about their identity. I wonder if they are the same ones that were in south Puget Sound a while back? They were milling around in the area where we found them, sometimes surfacing together a few times, sometimes with a few hundred yards between them. At one point a sea lion swam along with one of them for a few breaths!
About <b>3:00 pm</b> we spotted two <b>Dall's porpoise</b> heading west between Gedney Island and Whidbey Island.

"Spouting News" - SARATOGA GRAY CAUGHT EXHALING
<br/>Shortly before <b>8AM</b>; a Mariners Cove friend and neighbor called to notify me, to check out <b>whale </b>spouts mid channel, between north Whidbey and Camano islands. Traveling south, first seen from Camano's Brown Pt., passing Utsalady Bay, old time boat house/fishing communities of Maple Grove and Camp Grande. Right before Camp Grande's boathouse near Camano's Rocky Pt, <b>gray </b>turned west towards Crescent Harbor off Polnell Pt. At one point, saw two spouts within a second of two of each other. Two whales, exhaling? However, that was the only time I saw the two spouts together and wonder if my eyes were playing tricks on me. Will be curious if any reports come out today of gray sightings from the Crescent Harbor off 'Oak Harbor" and/or Penn Cove near Coupeville.

Watched <b>2 gray whales</b> this evening off <b>Jetty Island in Everett</b> from Harborview Park on Mukilteo Blvd. Wasn't sure at first if I was watching one very active whale or two, and then they both surfaced next to each other and spouted at the same time, so I knew it was two. One was prettty active, I saw fins and flukes a couple times, and one came out of the water enough one time to see that it had a lot of white on it's side. Wondering if maybe it was Patch.

The cool sighting of the day was that down toward the eastern end of the <b>Burrows Island</b> (NW of Deception Pass in Rosario Strait) about 100 yards west of the big white round buoy in the channel, I think I saw an <b>ORCA</b>! headed eastward around the end of the island. I saw its dorsal fin (a female?) and back, but not enough of it to identify the individual-- maybe a transient. It surfaced the one time that I saw it with the naked eye, and then I was too late to get my binoculars on it, but it resurfaced and I heard its blow. That made my day.

They were close to the shore by Point Defiance headed south towards the Tacoma Narrows bridge. They crossed the channel towards the Gig Harbor side. This was about <b>5:30pm</b>.  There was some sort of research type of boat trailing them.  
Later that night (about <b>7:45pm</b>), as we were entering our marina, we heard another call on the radio warning a boat  "Slow down, there are killer whales dead ahead" so they were <b>still around</b> a couple of hours later.

On our <b>Monterey Bay</b> Whale Watch trips today, Nancy Black and Alisa Schulman-Janiger saw <b>three groups of transient killer whales</b>. On our morning trip we saw a group of <b>10 whales that included the CA39s and the CA180s</b> that had killed a minke whale and were feeding on it. On the afternoon trip we first saw the<b> CA51s, and later saw the CA138s</b> that had killed a harbor seal.

Just wanted to report <b>two separate killer whale</b> sightings in <b>Monterey </b>today. The first sighting was a group of 8 killer whales including this male, <b>CA24</b>. They attacked and killed a Minke Whale. The second sighting of killer whales was of 5 animals, the ones known as the <b>CA51's</b>. They were also feeding on something but could not confirm as to what it was.

While enjoying, the beach on Ala Spit, heard spouts off Hope Island (north end of <b>Saratoga Passage</b>). Perfectly calm waters/easy to hear the spouts/not so easy to see them. <b>Gray </b>hugged Hope's rugged/rocky bank shoreline. Traveling at a snail's pace. Few spouts/most of the time submerged. Continued this pattern as it cruised over to nearby Skagit and Kicket Islands. First time ever have seen a gray around these picturesque islands. Kudos to Orca Network for posting a gray sighting in this area recently. Would not have gone/been there enjoying this evening's experience without the report. Thank you.

Got in from mowing at about the time of your last post.

<b>Orcas in Saratoga Passage</b> heading south - <b>3:45 pm </b>- probably off<b> Cama Beach</b> by now (<b>4:07 pm</b>). Looked like 5 of them, one male, a sprouter, 2 females and a young one. Too far away for any ID shots.

I spotted <b>three gray whales</b> from <b>Crescent Harbor</b> at about <b>6:30 p.m</b>. They were a long way off. One stayed quite a ways out between us and Camano Island. Two others traveled near the NEX parking lot on the Seaplane Base. We watched them for about an hour. 
<br/>Valerie Roseberry
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a pod of <b>Orcas </b>making their way SE towards the <b>Kingston ferry </b>dock.  Too far out to count accurately, it looked that there were more than four/five.
<br/>Peg Boley, South Camano
<br/>*<br/>
We sailed past <b>a pod of Orcas</b> on Saturday evening about <b>6 p.m.</b> about a quarter of the way from a line between <b>Marrowstone Island lighthouse and Fort Casey</b>.  Approximate Latitude, Longitude 48.117571,-122.684927. <b>Counted between 9-12 </b>including large males and several smaller ones in two separate groups. They appeared to be diving for 2-5 minutes at a time. Watched them for 10-15 minutes in heavy current.
<br/>Bob Frank
<br/>*<br/>
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research reviewed photos taken by John Haynes near Pt. Townsend, and identified the whales as: The<b> T100s, T101s, and T65As</b> are there and maybe the <b>T49As and T49Bs</b> in the background too. The adult male is <b>T102 </b>and and there are several pics of <b>T100C</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Matthew Clausen (sp?) called at<b> 7:46 </b>to say he had just seen <b>5 transients</b> next to the <b>Keystone ferry</b>, which was about the time we were watching at least three other smaller groups, 5 or 6 miles to the south, off Lagoon Point. So it appears the 2 tight groups of 6 - 10 in each group that we saw from Ft. Casey before 7 pm broke up into smaller groups, spread out over many miles.
<br/>Susan and Howard
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>a pod of about seven Orcas</b> (including juveniles) about 250 feet from shore heading South across<b> Admiralty Bay</b> (SW of the Keystone ferry landing). We are located about 1/4 mile down the beach from the Coupeville ferry terminal. Sighting was about <b>7:15pm</b> today!
<br/>Stacy Hauser Weigel
<br/>*<br/>
We found the orcas from <b>Ft. Casey</b>, heading toward <b>Lagoon Point from Port Townsend</b> in two groups, between <b>6:30 and 7 pm.</b> It looked like about<b> 15-18</b> in total. We headed to Lagoon Point, where we watched what look like Transients from <b>Lagoon Pt. from 7:45 - 8 pm</b>, as they continued south in several small pods. Too dark and distant for photos or IDs - hope they show up again tomorrow!
<br/>Susan and Howard
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>4:04 pm</b> Cindy called from the <b>Coupeville-Port Townsend ferry</b> with a report of <b>3 or 4 orcas</b> she was watching as she called. She says they are circling off the tip of Port Townsend. That sounds a lot like what the transient orcas were doing off Bush Point yesterday afternoon for at least 3 hours.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:30 -4:30 pm - 10 Orcas </b>just south of entry into Puget Sound off Whidbey Island southwest of <b>Fort Casey</b>. Generally southbound but kept circling around, pack swimming and at some times looking like they were playing with each other. At least one male. This was our first whale watching excursion. 
<br/>John Haynes
<br/>*<br/>
Not sure when they began, but <b>transient orcas</b> were traveling south in <b>Haro Strait</b>, passing the Orca Sound hydrophones at <b>5:00a.m.</b>  They continued vocalizing as they traveled down Haro, fading off and then being picked up on Lime Kiln hydrophones.

After a morning without seeing Orcas, I got the call from my wife.

Well, after watching the water from the foc'sle of the Tahlequah/Pt. Defiance ferry just about every weekday morning and evening for the past 14 years, I'm pleased to finally be able to report having seen<b> orcas--TWO of them!</b> (I've seen porpoises on several occasions--including several Dahl's porpoises this past Wednesday--but these are the first orcas I've seen off the south end of Vashon.) While they were too far away for me to have noted any specific markings, those amazingly tall dorsal fins were a clear giveaway that they were, indeed, orcas. I spotted the two swimming together just off the southwestern corner of <b>Vashon </b>(which I think is called Dalco Point, but I can't spare the time right now to check on this) at<b> 8:10 AM</b> this morning. Given my understanding that that is a rather biologically productive location, I'm guessing that they were feeding--especially since they appeared to be lingering around Dalco Point for awhile. A few minutes before then, though, I had seen them just off shore from the Tacoma Yacht Club. So, it seems as if they may have made a beeline for Dalco Point, then settled in there for a meal.

At one time we had Orcas on all sides of the boat. At one time we saw 8 fins out of the water at the same time.

<b>10:45 am</b> a call came in that 8 to 10 Orca were very slowly headed Northward towards <b>Powell River</b> BC from just North of Black Point (also known as Albion Point). No large male dorsals were spotted. They were zig zagging back and forth between Texada Island and the mainland. There were some sea lions tight to the mainland shore heading South.
<br/>Bill Taylor
<br/>After a few calls to find out if they had maybe turned again, at <b>1:40 pm</b> they finally showed up tight to the <b>Texada </b>shore across from Westview, <b>Powell River</b>. I watched them as they appeared to have a snack where numerous Harbour Seals have been hauled out on the rocks. They slowly turned back towards Grief Point (Powell River) and around <b>2:45 pm</b> I caught up to them with the skiff. They were very spread out in smaller groups that were resting, milling about and a couple of calves were playfully splashing about all just off of Myrtle Rocks. With it being so calm and no traffic, I managed to hear some wonderfully clear communication (vocals) and echolocation amongst the group of around 10 to 16 Orca. Garry Henkel of Aboriginal Journeys joined me with his tour all the way from Campbell River. Our two boats enjoyed the show slowly Southward till we were just below Brew Bay.

We had an incredible encounter on the Western Prince. We left Friday Harbor and were with the whales within 20 min. We caught up with the <b>T65's</b> (I think), a Mom and her 3 kids. We watched them from about <b>Yellow Island</b> heading north. They were spyhopping quite a bit and then when they rounded the corner, they started porpoising. After a couple min we caught back up with them and could tell that they were indeed <b>going after a Harbor Porpoise</b>. There were no other boats around and it was quite a sight. The Porpoise was thrown in the air, jumped on until it expired. We saw visible blood on the water and scraps that were getting carried away by gulls. It was a remarkable encounter. Here is a photo of the whale launching the harbor porpoise.

<br/>*<br/>
I love it when there are three sets of Orcas to visit. We only got to two sets, and saw <b>11 Orcas</b> in total...A larger group there were a total of 7 whales, the<b> T100s</b> - 5 of them, which included the two kids and <b>T11 </b>and the big male <b>T11A</b>. The small group (San Juan Channel to Spieden, etc) of 4 whales were the <b>T65As</b>. (Thanks Jeanne Hyde, my amazing naturalist...Check out her Blog:  Whale of A Purpose )

<br/>*<br/> 
We were watching them from <b>Pt. No Point</b> between about <b>5:30pm and 7:00pm</b> when we had our last sighting. It didn't seem like they were in any hurry to pass thru, but were slowly continuing North at last sight, still outside of Useless Bay.

Exciting first day on the water! Not only were we rewarded with an unseasonably gorgeous, sunny day, but we caught up with approximately <b>7 Transients</b> traveling in <b>Swanson Channel</b> (BC Gulf Islands), just off Salt Spring Island, and with Ganges Harbor in sight. Since transients tend to travel in very small groups, 3 - 5, our sighting today was exceptional. Also exceptional was the fact that they continually surfaced, which gave us many good views.

Just want to let you know that neighbors and I witnessed what I think was <b>ONE (possibly two) gray whales </b>feeding leisurely off shore of the west end of First St tonight, April 6th, GOOD FRIDAY EVENING, right about sundown. Details: At about quarter to eight I'd gone out on our front deck. We live on First Street, across from the <b>Inn at Langley</b>. From our deck I was chatting with our neighbor Tim who was also out of doors enjoying the evening light. Suddenly I heard the telltale BLOW of a whale, and listened for more. Sure enough, there were more blows. Having lived on First St for 12 years now, I'm pretty accustomed to the sound. Tim and I quickly ran across the street to neighbor Norma Jean's place on the bluff top next to the Inn, summoning her from her kitchen. Pretty soon there was a small group of neighbors - Tim, his wife Kate, Norma Jean and her friend Joy, Simon and me - AND A FEEDING GRAY WHALE for all to see and enjoy! For a while we couldn't tell if it was one or two, but I'm pretty sure it was just <b>ONE LARGE GRAY</b>. What we were seeing was his pectoral fin and his tail fin as he fed. I believe he was up off of Veronica's, about 3-500 feet off shore there off of the west end of First Street. He fed there off of the west end of First Street for some 20-30 minutes, then we watched him swim eastward, toward Langley's downtown, where he stopped right in front of the INN AT LANGLEY, feeding for a few minutes more. We hollered "WHALE! WHALE!" for the Inn's guests to hear. The sun was setting and a lovely pink sky came over Saratoga Passage. The water was very still and calm. Tim captured all this on his ipad, so he will send us the video soon and I'll post to I LOVE LANGLEY. I call the whale a him, but he could have been a her... don't know. Shamefully I did not have my binoculars. But if Veronica was home, she may have seen and i.d.ed the GRAY whale. It was truly a lovely evening, and very peaceful. LOVE LIVE THE WONDERFUL WHALES WHO VISIT LANGLEY EACH SPRING!

Captain Brian spotted a large male in the group of<b> T65As and the T49As &amp; Bs</b> about 50 yards away. The male surfaced  with a large adult seal draped across its half-open mouth! The orca made a shallow dive and Brian, Jesse, &amp; guests could see the whole seal being held delicately in its mouth. All of a sudden...WOOOSH! The male surfaced right next to the Sea Hawk with the seal still in tow. Prior to that, a juvenile swam past with a fresh kill in its mouth. It was a little gory, but Brian &amp; Jesse could follow the blood trail streaming from the whale's prey. Shortly after, small pieces of seal meat &amp; blubber started surfacing around the boat. Brian estimated there was a slick about 30 yards long of blood, oil, and seal meat at the surface. All this happened near <b>Yellow Island just outside of Friday Harbor </b>.

Way off in the distance a blow. It's so exciting to see a blow in the distance. We saw two big males, <b>T103 and T49c</b>, and then headed for our dock at Snug Harbor Resort. Later in the afternoon, as the second group of Orcas got closer, we went out on our second trip of the day to see them. They were the <b>65As, and the 49As and Bs</b>.

This afternoon at <b>2:30</b>, we hear <b>a grey whale </b>approaching our bank from the west, across from <b>Langley</b>, about 100 yards from shore. It traveled steadily out of view to the southeast, and I got into my car and drove to Camano Head to see if it would come into sight, and what it would do. Once it was directly off the Head, it was only about 30 feet from shore and was going in circles, feeding..?  The tide was not fully out, so it was in very shallow waters.  Once it had surfaced three times, it headed around the corner northwards towards Port Susan. I walked around the Head hoping to see what it would do, and it slowly came around the corner, in no hurry. I then heard another flow coming from the direction of Hat Island, but didn't see it through the trees. The first whale slowed down but eventually continued on north, followed by the second whale. I have always been curious to know if grey whales feed off<b> Camano Head</b>, and maybe they do.

"Spouting News" PEDESTRIAN TORTOISE CATCHES GRAY - Glanced out window around <b>8:20AM</b> at [<b>Mariners Cove</b>] while having a morning latte' and wala, <b>a gray whale</b> splashing around with its fin out of the water. After, only a 5 minute laid back feed/snack [on an out going tide] it headed towards <b>Polnell Pt</b>. Walking, the beach to keep pace wasn't going to happen. as gray was on the move. Kept falling further behind. Along, the way, bystanders that observed the gray; included, a blue heron on large almost submerged rock, a myriad of eagles, and kingfisher. A 30 minute walk at my turtle pace was rewarded; as, I caught up with the gray, at the finish line. Which had stopped to feed several hundred feet from the shoreline. An adult bald eagle was also at the finish without a checkered flag. Only, 30 feet away on a low 20 foot high branch/almost above my right shoulder. Highly unusual for an adult eagle to allow a person to get this close, as they always will fly away. We both watched the gray feeding and when the whale started to leave, the eagle, while facing me, turned its head to watch the gray spout away. Minutes later, the eagle flew away. About 50 spouts later, I left the gray steamboating around the secluded bay, off Polnell Pt. A good morning walk, indeed.

Encounter # 7 * April 1 * <b>T65A's</b> Moresby Island 
<br/>Observers: Dave Ellifrit and Jim Maya on Peregrine
<br/>After receiving reports of transients near Gooch Island, we left Snug Harbor with Capt. Jim Maya aboard Peregrine around 1:50 p.m. We arrived on scene at <b>2:20 p.m</b>. to find the <b>T65As (four animals)</b> milling just south of Moresby Island. The whales began traveling north into Swanson Channel where they soon fanned out in hunting mode. T65A2 was the westernmost whale while T65A and T65A4 were the closest to the bluffs along South Pender Island, B.C. T65A3 was somewhat in the middle. We left the whales still heading north in this formation at <b>3:10 p.m.</b> in lower <b>Swanson Channel</b>.

We saw <b>a gray whale</b> making its way about <b>10:00</b>, a whale watching boat following, about 200 yards from shore. As it worked its way toward <b>Camano Head and Hat Island</b>, another whale watching boat (Victoria Clipper, a hydrofoil) arrived from the south, stopping outside the boat boundary for whales. I drove down to Camano Head (1/4 mile) and waited to see the whale come around the corner; but it  never continued on its regular route towards Everett between Camano and Hat Islands. I wonder about the engines on this boat? The whale never resurfaced, my husband continuing to watch from our own bank, looking over at Langley, and myself at the Head. Sometimes the greys just seem to disappear!

At <b>5:20 pm</b>, we say <b>one grey</b> working its way south east between <b>Langley</b> and our location just around the western corner of <b>Camano Head</b>, about 200 yards from shore.

<b>2:55 pm -</b> Janine saw <b>a gray whale</b> off <b>Fox Spit/East Point</b>, Whidbey Island, 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:23 pm -</b> Nancy Zaretzke saw <b>one gray whale</b> off North Bluff Rd., <b>Whidbey Island</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:30 pm 2 Grey Whales</b> from around 5pm. The two were between <b>Texada Island and Westview, Powell River</b> heading Northward. I last saw their blows heading NW towards Vancouver Island around <b>6:45 pm</b>. Unusual to see them on this side of the strait.

On the <b>12pm </b>sailing from <b>Powell River to Comox</b> midway through the crossing, the crew announced sighting <b>a pod of orcas </b>in front of the ferry. We observed <b>6 orcas</b> in one group and one large male orca behind the ferry. We observed the male orca surface numerous times as it passed beside us. It came within about 100 metres of the ferry. It had a very tall, straight dorsal fin. The group of orcas in front of us turned towards the male orca and came towards us. We observed two medium sized orcas with a small orca swimming with each of them, a second large orca whose dorsal was bent over at the top and one other medium sized orca. After passing by the ferry's stern, the orcas turned north. I took a few photos from a distance. Enlarging them I could see the one large male orca's distinctive bent dorsal fin and some of the marking on one medium sized orcas.

<b>Orcas </b>Northbound by <b>Campbell River at 6 pm</b>. Apparently some at Menzies Bay, near Seymour Narrows now. Not sure how many. Not sure if we had 2 groups here or just one - seems pretty quick for them to get to the Narrows in 1 hour. Later info: Sounds like the number of Orcas Northbound past Campbell River at 6pm was <b>4 to 6</b>. Sounds like there were between <b>10 to 15 Orca in Menzies Bay</b>. Just milling about. Lots of seals in there - unusual.
