<br/>

Today <b>J Pod off SJI Land Bank West Side Preserve</b> heading north very slowly in amazing groups at about noon, heading south, <b>J16's and J17's</b> just off the rocks at <b>12:30 pm</b>. Many very close in at <b>Hannah Heights at 1pm</b>. At <b>4pm offshore of Pile Point</b> about a mile. My pics showed that K's were with the J's off San Juan Island. The K13's were very tight to shore off Hannah Heights. - Sharon Grace

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I walked inside the house and had an email waiting for me. Whales headed toward the island! Called the friends, they came running and soon we were with <b>J and K Pod off of Pile Pt. </b>They were foraging. We watched for a while as they started to <b>head west at 4:30</b>. On the way home, 20 or so Dall's followed us for a while. Great impromptu-ish day! - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

What a way to wrap up the season. We found local <b>humpback whale BCY0409 in the Gulf Islands (Swanson Channel)</b>, making big circles and 5 minute dives. We continued south to the<b> bottom of San Juan Island</b> where <b>J and K pod</b> were after exiting Puget Sound two days previous. They did not spend very much time off the island before heading west again, so we were so so lucky to see them forage, breach, and socialize in groups of 3 and more.
<br/>But the real treat was the <b>large group of Pacific White-sided dolphins</b> that were<b> just outside of Active Pass in the Gulf of Georgia</b>. There were hundreds of them, at least 200. If you've ever seen these acrobatic ocean goers, you know how energetic they are! It was such a privilege to watch that many of them porpoising and lunging themselves out of the water at high speed. Just the sound they made just with their splashing was impressive! Its hard to explain what seeing that many dolphins is like, so here are a few photos that might help illustrate. - Tasli Shaw, Steveson Seabreeze Adventures

<b>1:30 - </b>My daughter (Josephine, 4) and nanny saw <b>3-4 orcas </b>while playing at the beach in <b>Discovery Park (Seattle).</b> We aren't experts on identification, so can only report that they were there. Wish we had a picture! - Matt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Boarded the <b>1:10 boat from BI</b> and watched them mill off the lighthouse the entire time. Hoping they will continue south! - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spent an hour watching them from Magnolia Bluff/Blvd (about<b> 12:40 - 1:40</b>). Only one other person there watching where I was. Saw a full breach, some tail slaps, and some (mom with baby, don't know enough to ID) came fairly close to Magnolia shoreline. What a thrill! - Pacific Northwest Seasons

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Brad Hansen of NOAA Fisheries just called in an update at <b>12:15 </b>- the orcas are heading <b>INTO Elliott Bay</b>! They were between <b>Shilshole and Port Madison</b> around <b>noon</b> (interesting that they are STILL hanging around the site where the Suquamish artifacts were returned to the tribe yesterday - very cool).

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:12 - </b>Seeing <b>Orcas in Seattle from</b> shore at Golden Gardens! First time out of the San Juans! Awesome! - Melissa Kaday

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:08 - </b>For folks from Seattle, at <b>Carkeek park</b>and seeing activity just slightly north from here, but much closer to the west shore. Bring good binocs. - Laura Bestor Riedel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around 1<b>1:00 am sighted 3 or 4 Orcas hunting off Bainbridge Island</b>. East side between Yomalt Point and Wing Point. There was at least one large male. Watched them for about 30 minutes. There may have been more they were swimming around and back and forth off my bank. - Sally Sieber

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00am -</b> Lots of animals, spread out all over, individuals and small groups, still headed south, between<b> President's Point and Richmond Beach Saltwater Park</b>. Seeing some tail slaps on the Kitsap side.
<br/><b>10:33am -</b> I have eyes on a group of dorsal fins, headed steadily south. They're positioned south of the Kingston-Edmonds ferry lane, traveling mid-channel between Kitsap peninsula and Point Wells (south of Edmonds, north of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park). - Dave Haas

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 - </b>have seen one big boy traveling w/adult female and young one off Kayu Kayu park north Richmond Beach, and another big male across just passing in front of Kingston ferry (sighhtline) still southbound.
<br/><b>10:37 - </b>at least a dozen, spread out mid channel and both sides...slowed to forage, they foraged in this same spot last night! - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:54 - </b>Wsf ferry Spokane report pod of approx <b>12 orca</b> headed southbound in <b>kingston/ Edmonds ferry lane</b>. - Wayne McFarland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Our Ocean Magic tour found <b>about ten Humpback Whales near Race Rocks Ecological Reserve</b>. Most of these humpbacks were traveling in pairs, demonstrating how they appreciate the company of friends just like we do! Our afternoon zodiac tour's expert skipper Mark was able to track down some <b>transient killer whales (T46 B's and C's) </b>further west as well. - Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Today was one of the best Orca watching days of the 25 years living in the Great Pacific Northwest! During four hours from our little neighborhood park we watched the <b>J &amp; K pods spread out over a 1/2 mile</b>. Probably over 40 Orcas feeding and breaching in the warm sunshine!!!! A very sweet and happy bunch! The Orcas filled everyone's heart with joy! And even closer we watched 30 passing porpoises and a few seals and 100's of sea birds and also several salmon jumping out of the water. All with the Olympic Mountain range in full view! People were lined up at our spotting scope. Many were excited Orca virgins. . Always the best!! YAY! - at Carkeek Park. - Kenny Hamm

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:15 - </b>I leave under the watchful eye of the Olympic mountains...last group of two big boys and a few females and youngins <b>nearing Kingston</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Saw about<b> 5 or 6 on the Kingston side</b>. Very far from us over here on the Edmonds side but I still am happy to have seen them thanks to a few others with binoculars who pointed them out. - Kellie Sagen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

From north<b> Richmond Beach</b> late this afternoon into evening I watched<b> J &amp; K pod</b> travel northward very spread out and in small groups. Saw a few breaches and tail lobs as they continued their steady journey northward mostly west of mid channel. A few whales (including one of the big boys) swam mid way between me and mid channel, stalled and foraged for 10 minutes. A boat packed with burly fishermen motoring south erupted in celebration and cut their engine once aware of the orcas in their presence. A big boy surfaced and another spy-hopped near their boat eliciting more cheers, all of us happy to be absorbing these creatures swimming beside them. The orcas and the setting sun behind my beloved Olympic mountains fills my being. Days like these.... - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:54 - </b>Saw a couple breaches, some fins and lots of spouts just south <b>Edmonds Beach/Dog Park</b> vantage point. Looks like they're headed west. - Tammie Burks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 pm - 10 or more </b>are straight across from <b>Kingston ferry</b>. One breach! Mid channel right now. - Kim Funchess

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:35 - </b>Alisa Brooks posted that the lead <b>orcas in Puget Sound</b> were nearing Kingston, still heading north. Time to look from Pt No Point and South Whidbey to see which way they go!

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I watched them forage from mid-<b> Bainbridge Island east side toward Richmond Beach</b> for about 2 hour last night, when I went home<b> at 5:30</b>. Good eats, I suppose! - Susan Vennerholm

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:15 PM.</b>.....several of them heading north more on the west side between <b>President Point, Kingston and Kingston proper</b>. One even did a nice breach! - Chris Beamer Otterson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:47 - About 6-7 just off Fay Bainbridge</b>. Still heading north. They are glistening in the sun! Yeah! - Sue Surowiec Larkin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:30 - </b>Just left them as they passed <b>Wing Point, Bainbridge side</b>. Lots of breeching!! - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:35 - </b>Willie Wilson, 2nd mate on the ferry Tacoma, called to report a large pod of <b>at least 20 orcas about .5 - 1 mile off Restoration Point</b>, heading north. The males were on the perimeter of the group, females and younger orcas inside the group. A lot of breaching going on, and a lot of happy passengers on the ferries that are slowing and stopping to watch the whales go by!

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

What a perfect West Seattle day! We got to watch the <b>orcas swim south to about the south end of Blake Island</b> before they turned back north. Lots of tail slapping and breaches. Here are a couple of photos - my favorite is the first, of an orca just finishing a backflip - a moment later all you could see was a huge splash! - Trileigh Tucker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:54 - </b>Been watching a pod of orca from <b>alki/beach drive junction</b>. moving from north blake island to north vashon - out in middle of channel. a big california sea lion swimming around 30 yards off the shore - he's been here 30 min... - M James Sullivan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This morning I counted approx <b>16 Orca </b>traveling south at speed. They were led by two large males, followed at varying speeds by the rest. Last to pass was a female and a smaller possible calf. I live on high bank waterfront on the <b>East Side of Bainbridge Island, between Yomalt Point and Wing Point/ Murden Cove</b>, and the entrance to Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island. East Side of the Island directly facing Seattle downtown. - Sally Sieber

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:40 -</b> Whales are Southbound now, leaders passing <b>Blake Island marina</b>.
<b>11:24 - </b>Orcas milling off <b>south end of Bainbridge Island</b> right now, visible from West Seattle with binoculars. - Stephanie Raymond

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:35 - </b>Maia of WSF reports a group of <b>about 8 orcas</b> near the bouy off<b> Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Is</b>., headed south.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 - Orcas confirmed from seattle Bainbridge ferry</b> this morning. - Dana Barrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 - orcas at yeomalt point Bainbridge island</b> southbound. Several Males and spread out. - Chris Slye

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 - Orcas just off point Wilson</b> (closer to to the point than mid channel) appear to be heading south into Admiralty Inlet! Not sure how many or who but looked to be Approximately 10 or so. No IDs. Too far away and only saw blows with dorsals. - Renee Ramirez, Victoria Clipper

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b> 9:24..</b>.i am atop bluff north end of <b>Richmond Beach Park</b>, can see what I believe is activity south of Faye Bainbridge Park, sightline midway between that and Eagle Harbor (Bainbridge ferry)..if you transect they're out there somewhere in middle. Please keep in mind that's with a healthy dose of long distance viewing. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9 am - </b>Whales reported heading south from <b>Richmond Beach, Edmonds</b>. - Jeff Hogan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 - </b>Heads up to everyone on the <b>Bainbridge/Seattle ferrries</b>. A large pod moving south in the middle of the sound<b> just off President Point in Kingston</b>. Can see the spouts with my naked eye but best viewed thru binoculars. - Chris Beamer Otterson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Looks like the SRKWs might be back in Puget Sound this morning. My neighbor Larry walked up and rang my doorbell to tell me he was seeing some dorsal fins out there. Sure enough I grabbed my binoculars and am seeing a number of dorsal fins of Richmond Beach / Shoreline, spread out between south of the mid-channel buoy down to 1-2 miles off <b>Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.</b> Hopefully you can get the word out so central and south Sound folks can be ready! - Dave Haas

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Spotted <b>a small female orca with playful calf</b>, flipping it's tail half out of water repeatedly. Seemed solo which struck me as odd. . I believe there was a feeding event before we came on the scene as the animals were located because of a flock of sea gulls not unlike a shark attack or sea lion feeding event, we slowed the boat and went neutral for a moment maintaining our distance, animals were headed south.<b> Lat 38,50, 30ftms between Saunders reef and Anchor Bay Nor Cal.</b> I am a commercial urchin diver, on my boat with thousands of hrs time in this area, first sighting here although I've had several off Pt Arena, always pods though. - Erik Owen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

An urchin fisherman spotted <b>3 killer whales, including a calf yesterday at ~2:30PM, 1 mile NW of Haven's Anchorage, Gualala, CA</b>. Coordinates were 38 48.304N, 123 36.771W. Animals were possibly harassing seals and were non-directional. No photos were submitted. - Naked Whale Research

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>23 humpbacks</b> were seen in our area, <b>most of them west of Race Rocks</b>. Orcas were seen late of the West Side, some NE of Orcas Island, and some going west way west of Victoria...- James Mead Maya

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">October 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

I saw <b>a large pod of Orcas on the east side of Whidbey Island</b>. I have a home near the point of<b> Fox Spit. At 9:30am</b>, I saw a large Orca completely breach just off the point. Then watched about <b>30-40 more parade up Saratoga Passage</b>, heading north, for about an hour. Adults and young whales - a couple of the young ones playfully breached as they went along. Amazing to see. - Troy Carlson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T123A was east bound south east of Race Rocks in the morning.</b> - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Faint <b>SRKW calls (J pod) </b>began several minutes ago on the <b>Port Townsend hydrophone</b>, but I had to wait until the ferry left to confirm what I was hearing. - Meg McDonald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Watching orcas from Baby Island to the Clinton Ferry terminal</b>, followed them for around 13 miles...beautiful day and wonderful people I met along the way. Best show was when the orcas were near the ferry terminal and hugging Columbia Beach. Lots of excited folks...and ferry personnel too happy day for all. The 4 and 4:30 boat runs had the most excitement. You could hear people screaming from ferry and land! - Marilyn Armbruster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:54 -</b> We just left the whales swimming off toward the sunset, looks like they were going to head out Admiralty Inlet. - Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:49 - </b>Maybe <b>headed towards Hansville</b> now. I had a nice breach after my last message. As we birders say it was a "lifer" for me, ending a 30 year streak.
<br/><b>5:41 - </b>I am at Hines Warf Park north of Edmonds and seeing very distant whales along the west side of Whidbey, headed northish. - Josh Adams

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:10 - </b>Alice Lindahl saw <b>lots of orcas passing Possession Point</b> in a long procession of small groups, many breaching over and over.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

John Crawford of Glendale, south of Clinton, called at<b> 5:10 pm to report 2 large bulls heading south, at Possession Bait </b>(near Possession Point Park).

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 - </b>from atop a high bluff in<b> north Edmonds</b> I saw what appeared to be much porpoising. I thought Admiralty too...glad to know you were there with them.

Here are some photos I took this morning from shore at <b>Pt. No Point</b>. We saw lots of blows mid-channel when I first arrived<b> 10:30</b>. I'm pretty sure I saw Samish J14 and her crew along with many others (but it was hard to say with the chop). Then we had a mixed group come by about 10 minutes later right off shore (from 50-100 yards). I saw the J22s for sure, J27, J39, and J16 and crew. Also pretty sure L92 was there (it's hard to miss that dorsal of his!) and also I'm pretty sure K16 and K35. They were all moving south at a fast clip. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu
<br/><i>I see J14, J26, J27, J34, J35, J38, J39, J40, K14, K16,  and maybe L106 (behind J39 in one of the two pics he's in) in those eleven photos.  Looks like a good day to be taking pictures from shore! -Dave Ellifrit</i>

<b>Humpback whales - 5 individuals (2 were juveniles), entrance to Beecher Bay BC.</b> Moving in circles - staying in the same general location. Sighted <b>between 1100 and 1300</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

But we did match our previous record for <b>humpback</b> sightings!!! Mark set out at a full boat at <b>10am </b>in search of humpbacks and he didn't have to go far. These whales have been loving the areas<b> between Victoria and Sooke</b>. That gives us lots of time with the animals, but also time to find more! All in all we spotted<b> 17 humpbacks again today</b>. The humpbacks in this area typically spend the summer here, instead of going all the way to the Alaskan feeding grounds frequented by most humpbacks in the North Pacific. Most of the whales we've been seeing recently have been the migratory ones, so not ones we recognize. This just makes the numbers more impressive, because that's not including our "resident" bunch. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Constance Bank (Strait of Juan de Fuca). The <b>T46Bs and T46Cs</b> had been milling around <b>Constance Bank</b> since around <b>10:30AM</b>, and when we got there in the afternoon, they were still prowling around, not really traveling definitively in any direction (possible interesting side note:<b> members of J, K, and L pods were at one point about 8NM to the west</b> of where the Biggs/transients were, possibly preventing the Ts from making a comitment to go west ... not to mention in the mix with the ressies were multiple humpback whales! wow!).  Nevertheless, these expert hunters picked off one harbour seal while we were with them, possibly two. We left them milling and trending NW toward William Head.  - Tasli Shaw

(<i>Includes transients, residents, and humpbacks</i>)  
<br/>Mark set out with reports of eight transient <b>killer whales at 11am</b>, but there was much more in store. Captain Jeff on Ocean Magic followed at <b>12:15pm</b> and picked up the same<b> group of transients</b>. It was then that we heard our two favourite words in the English language over the radio: "<b>Residents inbound</b>" <b>All three pods of resident whales zigged and zagged around as they came in with the tide.</b> There was resting, foraging, and socializing, all in the same group! But the <b>humpbacks</b> were not to be out-done. Throughout the day at least <b>7 or 8 individuals</b> were spotted, including <b>Split-Fin and Heather</b>. They are offspring of some of the original humpbacks to return to these waters after they were hunted out. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

So we had to go to Victoria, Canada to do it, but on my last day of being on the boat a couple of us Friday Harbor people saw <b>Orcas </b>today! I'm so happy I got to see them. <b>T46b and c group</b>. There were also about 20 humpbacks out there AND Residents about 20 miles west of where we were milling off of Vancouver.

Mark Malleson broke his personal humpback record. A radio transmission came through at <b>11:45am</b>, less than an hour into Mark's trip. He was blown away by the incredible visibility, thrilled about the conditions, saying everything was "gorgeous!" In three hours on the water Mark saw <b>no fewer than 17 individual humpback whales!</b> This was truly a once in a lifetime trip. A peak whale day, during peak humpback season, during an exceptional humpback year. Naturalist Rhonda noted that there was even <b>a humpback inside Race Rocks Ecological Reserve</b>; most likely rolling through the kelp and feeding on invertebrates. There is evidence humpback feeding habits could more be diverse than originally thought, and this observation certainly supports that. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Saw what I thought <b>might be a Gray Whale (possibly a humpback) </b>around <b>12:30pmoff of Pt. Wilson</b> . Slowly rolling/moving through the water, saw it spouting(?), no dorsal fin, heading in to Puget Sound. The one day I didn't have my spotting scope and I see something!!! - Doug Bullis

Tony just called to report a group of<b> ~100 White-sided dolphins in Malaspina Strait, BC, at 3 pm</b> - at first they were headed NW, then as he was talking to me they stopped and were milling and feeding.

My husband and I were at <b>Titlow Beach Park (west Tacoma) for sunset last night, and saw a gray whale</b> (I think) swimming around about 300-400 ft off shore. - Jamie Sproul

BCFerry trip headed to Victoria on Saturday, just<b> past 4pm</b> announced <b>whales headed north offshore of North Pender</b>. The crew initially said <b>humpbacks</b>, but corrected it to Fin whales?? I observed 3 blows from each of the pair and then there was a back arch and fluke lift from each and they were gone. The flukes were narrow, pointed and distinctly white. They didnt look like the typical humpback fluke however. Possibly minke? Yet they dont often lift flukes on a dive ... - Paul C

While out for a kayak trip with some friends on Saturday we spotted <b>two orca way inside Pedder Bay near Weir Point</b>. The one in the photo was by far the largest while the other one had a dorsal fin about half the size. I'm not sure if you might be able to tell the identification of this whale but the locals said that he has been around before. - Mark Byrne

An amazing encounter with Mark Malleson (<b>15:14</b>) aboard 'The Empress', <b>5 miles south of Otter Point (Sooke)</b> with a<b>pprox.7 'exotic, unknown' transients</b>. (Later ID'd as CA166s). They were busy beating up a stellar sealion when we arrived on scene. Our encounter lasted 45 minutes. We left once all animals had gone down ... for dinner at last. An incredible encounter with the top apex predator in the ocean. I have more videos on my facebook for anyone interested. I will make them public. Thanks to Mark and Prince of Whales for this amazing opportunity. - Claire Mosley, Marine Biologist, Jamie's Whaling Station

Our local waters are a hopping hangout for humpback whales right now! This time of year, humpbacks gather in large numbers to feed in the Southern water of the Strait of Georgia - eating as much as they can before the long journey back down south to warmer tropical waters. Today <b>we saw a whopping nine humpbacks</b>! The water conditions were incredible, flat and calm. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Gray whale</b> is back and at the same place as yesterday - slowly moving back and forth along the sand spit at C<b>ooper Point on the Eld Inlet side</b>.  It eventually went down Eld a small ways, very near show and then came back to the northern end of the spit.  It has since headed down the Budd Inlet side, again, very near shore. - Kim Merriman  
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>Minke whales	
Just crossed the <b>Hood Canal bridge at 9:45am</b>. Spotted<b> a whale</b> surfacing just off the north side of the bridge headed east towards Salisbury Point Park. The whale is almost black in color with a small dorsal. - Jen Walters <i>This sounds like a minke, or possibly a humpback.</i>
<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>1:26 pm - Gray whale</b> is still here. Same place......moving slowly (with shallow surfacing) back and forth along the west side of Cooper Point spit.  <b>7:00 am -</b> I just watched this whale doing many slow surfacing series back and forth in the mouth of <b>Eld Inlet, right at the tip of Cooper Point</b>. It hung around for at least  30 minutes  - or at least that's how long I was able to watch it once I noticed it. I have since lost track of it. - Kim Merriman 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpback</b> sightings continued in abundance today. According to our zodiac skipper Rush, "there was practically a humpback superpod". With <b>up to fifteen of them</b> in our local waters, no matter which direction you looked - you could see the blow of whales. One zodiac tour watched in awe as two humpbacks swam near them in a resting formation in smooth, glassy calm waters. What a beautiful sight to see! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

 Transient orca off the Eel River CA. Here be pix posted by a tuna sports fisher on the Humboldt Tuna Club website on Sunday, 5 Oct - he'd commented that a highlight of their day was trolling alongside <b>a big kw</b>, I asked for pix, he replied... and I'll post results, try to get more of a discussion going, again. They were near the <b>Eel River buoy</b>, which is at 40°43'25" N 124°34'41" W. - Jeff Jacobsen

Nearing<b> Victoria, two magnificent humpback whales</b> cruised along side-by-side, the sound of their blows resonating across the glassy sea surface as they dived and surfaced in harmony. We saw the undersides of both tail flukes as the whales prepared to take a deeper dive - a fitting farewell as we turned for home. - Sandra Pollard, SSAMN, Freeland, Whidbey Island

<b>West of Victoria, past Race Rocks, towards Sooke we came across a group of 40+ orcas</b> scattered along the shoreline and offshore near Beechy Head, <b>members of both J and K pod, and they believed L pod</b> was also in the area. Our 12:15 Ocean Magic also saw <b>a humpback whale just outside of Victoria Harbour</b>. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray , Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was nature in the raw as we watched <b>a pod of 6 to 8 transient orca off Eagle Point, San Juan Island, make a kill</b>.  Well that explains what the poor little harbor seal was hiding from.  Afterwards passengers on 'Mystic Sea' reported seeing an orca swimming backwards!  The whales eventually headed north in a tight formation - a truly memorable last day for us. - Richard Snowberger, Crew/Naturalist on Mystic Sea 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orca Whales from the south end of SJ island</b>. A great start to any day. On the way out in the afternoon we stopped at Whale Rocks to view about 50 roaring Steller Sea Lions. What a sight! Then on up to the <b>T36As and T124s</b>. Soon another boat came on the radio to let us know about <b>2 Humpback Whales and 2 more Transient Orcas</b> they found to the north. So we circumnavigated San Juan Island with lots of playful Dall's Porpoises, <b>T20 and T21, and 2 Humpbacks (BCY0324 "Big Mama" and CS280)</b> on the way home. - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching &amp; Wildlife Tours

Phenomenal day out there! Glassy waters and all the wildlife we could possibly fit in to an afternoon. Seals, two kinds of sea lions, two kinds of porpoises, a bald eagle, <b>two groups of transient orcas, and humpback whales</b>! - Katie Jones

Left our dock at Snug Harbor Resort and Marina at 12:30 today. In ten minutes we were attacked by 20 or so Dall's Porpoise. All hands on the bow as the Dall's ran in front of the Peregrine. As I looked off towards Kelp Reef, <b>a humpback fluke sounded</b>. The Dall's followed us almost to the humpie. After a half hour with the big humpback, we went to see <b>3 Transient Orcas just south of Victoria</b>. Another ok afternoon... - James Mead Maya

We noticed that the<b> Humpback</b>s were producing a high pitch noise during exhalation referred to as "trumpeting." Trumpeting is thought to occur when Humpbacks are stressed or anxious. Even though the Southern Resident Orcas only consume fish and will not prey on these large whales, it doesn't mean that the Humpbacks are not going to be a little on the nervous side! - Kevin Culmback

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9 am - Orcas</b> just spotted at the end of <b>Old Farm Rd. San Juan Island</b>...No direction yet.
At <b>8:20 this morning</b> I got the call from a former passenger who told me that she and her husband had just seen a couple of <b>Orcas near Eagle Pt., San Juan Island</b>, going up island. By the end of the day those two Orcas had turned into the Super Pod, and...and...five Humpbacks! Another OK day! We left the HBs going north and the Rezzies going south at Lime Kiln Light. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This morning there were so many whales around that Skipper Rush had to choose whether to check out <b>three humpbacks</b> reported in the area, or go to see the <b>resident killer whales</b>. The residents turned out to be our two largest pods <b>J pod and L pod</b>. That's at least 62 whales! They socialized and enjoyed each other's company off San Juan Island. The afternoon tour was lucky enough to see a humpback whale swimming almost side by side with the resident killer whales! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I saw <b>members of all 3 pods</b> today, and<b> 3 humpbacks off the west side</b>. 2 of which we're traveling very close to the residents. Very cool out there today. - Traci Walter
