<b>March 31, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Just now I heard two [<b>gray</b>] whales blow in the shallows below my house on East Point. What a gift to end the day with. It was obviously too dark to see anything, but I could hear them clearly.
<br/>Windwalker
<br/>East Pt, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Suzy Smith called at <b>4:45 pm</b> to report 3 <b>grays</b> about 100 yds. off the Snakelum Pt. buoy, Penn Cove, Whidbey Island. They had been watching them travel east for about 20 minutes, then saw them take a deep dive.
<br/>*<br/>
The [<b>gray</b>] whales are now between Polnell Point on Whidbey &amp; Rocky Point on Camano, headed northeast. We’ve been watching them for more than 35 minutes now (at <b>5:05 PM</b>), beginning 100 yards west of the Snakelum Point buoy and followed them out to where they are now. There are definitely 3 gray whales out there today. We saw 3 blows almost simultaneously and one blow was smaller than the other 2.
<br/>Suzy &amp; Clay Smith and Jim Bohardt
<br/>Snakelum Point, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Elliot Menashe called to report 2 <b>grays</b> in front of old Clinton Beach, whidbey Island, south of Hat Island at <b>1:45 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at <b>1:20 pm</b> to report 3 <b>grays</b> southbound near the Clinton ferry lanes. Cascadia Research was onboard, &amp; ID'd #53 &amp; #44. He had a report from Island Adventures of 4 grays up in Penn Cove today as well.
<br/>*<br/>
Sometime around 12 <b>noon</b> at least one [<b>gray</b>] whale was at the entrance to Holmes Harbor about midway between Greenbank and Baby Island (per my husband)
<br/>From  Karen (Offner) Eaton
<br/>Greenbank on Whidbey 
<br/>*<br/>
Received another call at from Warren at the Lewis &amp; Clark interp. Ctr near the mouth of the Columbia River - 6 <b>orcas</b> off the N. Jetty again at <b>11 am</b>, milling.....could be L pod again??! Talked to Brad Hansen on the NOAA ship - they were able to get more ID's confirmed of yesterday's whales &amp; found there were also K pod whales present with the L's. The ship was on its way back in this morning, but another NOAA boat was in the area of the Columbia &amp; was hoping to find the orcas &amp; ID them. <br/>Susan, Orca Network
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0730</b> Bells Beach (4 mi NE of Langley) Two, maybe 3 <b>grays</b> feeding from just beyond the buoy line to farther out.  Seemed like one was heading N, the other two were heading toward Camano. Or the one feeding closer &amp; heading N had maybe joined up with the one feeding farther out.???Watched them for about 30 min.
<br/>Peggy Sullivan
<br/>Bells Beach, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2am</b>. a calm and quiet sea with the unmistakable sound of a mighty Grey
feeding very near the shore.

Taylor Kissinger called in a report of 1 male &amp; 1 female <b>orca </b>10 miles west of the Columbia River Sea Buoy at <b>1700 </b>hours, heading south. 
<br/>*<br/>
A neighbor told me this <b>morning </b>that while paddling in Seattle's Shilshole Marina he encountered a <b>grey </b>whale.
<br/>Rob Casey Photographer
<br/>Seattle
<br/>*<br/>
Yesterday on the ferry on the way to the SEATAC I thought I saw a spout. It rose up a bit again (we only saw part of the back) and blew one more time, but this time all three of us got to see it. I'm guessing it was a <b>gray</b> based on location and lack of a dorsal fin. We were on the <b>9:30 am</b> ferry. The whale was heading for the Saratoga passage.
<br/>Celia
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb called tonight to relay a report from Brad Hanson of the NWFSC, who is out on the NOAA ship McArthur looking for whales....Brad got my call about the <b>orcas</b> sighted off the mouth of the Columbia River this morning (see report below) &amp; they turned the ship around &amp; found the pod at about <b>3 pm</b>, 12 miles offshore, &amp; identified them as at least 3 sub groups of L pod! They were traveling south, &amp; the ship was following them this evening until they have to head back to port. 
<br/>susan 
<br/>*<br/>
Just watched 2 <b>grays</b> pass by my house at <b>~4:30 pm</b>, heading south past Race Lagoon (near Penn Cove). Mystic Charters was near by, so am sure they’ll be able to identify who they were. We watched them for approx 20 minutes as they slowly headed south, their flukes were very visible but too far for a decent picture.
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>Coupeville, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:30pm</b> one lone <b>Gray</b> whale spotted between Camano head and Gedney Is. It was making long deep dives and moving about 1/4 to 1/2 mile between sightings.
<b>3:45pm</b> - Three grays were working  down the shore from Harington Lagoon to Race Lagoon.  They may have been feeding but were travelling down the shoreline as we watched.
<br/>Kyle Saum, Captain
<br/>Mystic Sea Charters
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called &amp; reported 3, maybe 4 <b>gray</b> whales off Scatchet Head, SW Whidbey Island at <b>12:30 pm</b>, feeding in the water column between Scatchet Head &amp; Possession Pt. ID'd #53. Yesterday  they had # 53 &amp; # 22. 
<br/>*<br/>
We received a message from Warren Hartman, a whale watch volunteer at Lewis &amp; Clark Interp. Ctr. reporting 4 - 6 <b>orcas</b> off the north Jetty from <b>11 - 11:15 am</b>. They had 2 other unidentified groups of whales reported the previous 2 days in the morning as well, that he thought may also have been orcas.
<br/>*<br/>
At least 2 <b>gray</b> whales were feeding in front of Langley this morning at <b>3:40 AM</b>. They stayed for about a ½ hour and were heading east. And there was a single gray whale this morning at 6:20 again feeding in front of Langley and heading east.

<br/>*<br/>
We received a message today from Faye Wellspoken (or maybe she meant Faye@whales spoken here?) at the Umpqua Lighthouse, Winchester OR, reporting one <b>orca</b> just off the mouth of the Umpqua River, near a gray whale &amp; her calf at <b>1:21 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Gail Fleming called to report 1 or 2 <b>grays</b>, heading around Sandy Pt. at <b>8 am</b>, heading SE toward Clinton.
<br/>*<br/>
Well, we just got back from the beach and a visit with two <b>Grays</b> at ~<b>7:45 am</b>. One was Patch and the other equal to his size. They fed for awhile (East Pt, Saratoga Psg) below our house, then headed out to open water, traveling side by side. Right now they turned and were headed for Bell’s Beach.
<br/>Windwalker – East Point, Saratoga Passage
<br/><br/>
<b>March 28, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>5pm</b> Two <b>Greys</b> just north of Sandy Point,  could see the blows from 1st street, and went to Sandy Point to check them out. They were feeding, I got a few good
shots. There was a few tale flaps and what looked to be a spy hop. They stayed there for about an hour and then swam toward Camano Island. This is the third time this week that I have seen greys in this area.
<br/>Heather Newman
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>

<b>March 27, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
I observed what I guess was a <b>gray</b> whale just offshore in Edmonds today. Due to surface chop I only observed its blows but did so for about 2 hours from approximately <b>3p to 5p</b>.
<br/>Paul Edwardsen
<br/>*<br/>
My husband called from the <b>3 PM</b> Clinton to Mukilteo ferry. A <b>gray</b> whale was passing by, headed northeast towards Clinton.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden

<br/>Bob Armbruster (Freeland)
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>*<br/>
It is about <b>11:20 a.m</b>. and I just came in from watching two <b>Grays</b> feeding just north of Whidbey Island in the Saratoga Passage. They moved along the shore toward Sandy Point and then headed out toward Possession Sound. A third Gray was in deeper water not far away from the feeding whales.

<br/><br/>
<b>March 26, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Several sightings of two <b>gray</b> whales today off of east point (Saratoga Psg) off Whidbey shores. Initially saw the whales about half way between baby island and east
point about 1/4 mile off shore at about <b>12:30pm.</b> they proceeded along the
shore heading east and feeding on sand shrimp. It is about 6pm now and they
have returned one more time.
<br/>(from photos sent, one of the whales is Patch-sb)

Well this has been an amazing day for <b>Grays</b>! Patch was definitely in our neighbor hood around <b>2:00pm</b>. He fed in the mud flats between Baby Island and East Point, swam out, then came back in again. Then, Patch began to move south toward the tip of East Point. Patch headed for the point and the boat just came charging in full speed ahead.

2 possibly 3 <b>grays</b> in middle of Saratoga passage at <b>9:00am</b> directly west of Mabana Shores. They appear NOT to be bottom feeding, but close to the surface and very active. Slapping surface and going in circles. Perhaps a school of fish that they have found.  Working their way N. with traffic from small speed boats.   
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>7:00am</b> today, I heard very loud blows near the beach below us (East Pt, Saratoga Psg). By the time I got down there, whatever <b>Gray</b> was there was gone. All I could tell was that it was moving along East Point, then headed towards Bell’s Beach. I could hear the blows moving off, but it was too far gone by the time we got there.

<br/>*<br/>
Deborah Koff Chapin &amp; I got to take a break &amp; watch 3 <b>grays</b> pass along the Langley waterfront, close in, around noon, heading SE toward Sandy Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:20</b> 3 <b>Gray</b> whales are feeding in front of Langley. One of the whales is “Patch”.  They are headed to the southeast. They’ve been aggressively feeding (lots of fluke and pectoral fins waving around and big clouds of sand!) for the last half hour.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden

<br/><br/>
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called to report a <b>gray</b> whale east of Camano Head at 2 pm, &amp; 2 other grays off Race Lagoon at around <b>4 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
This morning at <b>5:30a.m</b>. a <b>gray</b> whale on the tide flats at Mabana Shores Camano feeding on ghost shrimp. Stayed in the area of the flats for approximately l hour. So far this season we have no whale feeding pits....I think things are about to change. In past years we would have had  dozens and dozens of pits exposed at minus tides, by this time of year.  
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/><br/>
<b>March 21, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Tom Paul of Kayak Pt, Port Susan called to report 2 <b>grays</b> at approx. <b>11 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
3 <b>grays</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> in saratoga passage. 
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>6 pm</b> I looked out the window &amp; saw three [<b>gray</b>] whale spouts in Saratoga Passage, closer to the Camano side south of Elger Bay. The spouts were close together in quick succession - my guess is the mother &amp; calf pair, with the calf taking 2 quick breaths or possibly a third whale close by. I watched as they traveled north &amp; saw spouts a few more times.
<br/>susan 
<br/>Orca Network, Greenbank
<br/>*<br/>
There are two <b>gray</b> whales traveling northwest, near Camano, opposite Langley at <b>4:10 pm</b>. Through the binoculars one whale’s “breathing plume” and fluke look smaller than the other. Maybe a mother and calf?
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley, Whidbey Island
<br/><br/>
<b>March 20, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Add to the flurry of <b>gray</b> whales 6-8 individuals we encountered while surveying off the outer coast. The majority were northbound migrants, but we did find one small whale well inside Grays Harbor. Aside from these sightings it was a very quiet day offshore, with only a few additional harbor porpoise and pinniped encounters. 
<br/>Erin Andrea Falcone

<br/>Olympia
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:20</b>, The <b>gray</b> whale, “Patch” just came along feeding along the beach, north of Langley, heading east. A kayaker showed up and Patch headed across to Camano.  I’m not sure if the whale did that because of the kayaker or if he was heading that direction anyway. I did not see how close the kayaker came to the whale.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley, Whidbey Island

Got just a quick look at a large [<b>gray</b>] whale’s tail coming out of the water this morning from the Washington State Ferry Klickatat. We were just beginning to depart the dock from Port Townsend at <b>8am</b> and the whale was approximately 300-400 yards in front of us in Port Townsend Bay. I kept an eye on the area until we were out of range but never saw it come back up.

We saw an (<b>gray</b>)? around <b>1:05</b>. There seemed to be only one. Had a very large tail but to small for a gray whale?. It was spotted on the Port Townsend and Keystone ferry. ... seemed to  be hunting in a area. We didn't see a fin but we saw the tale of it. I haven't seen any whales in the area but have heard of all the whales on the ferry ride.
<br/>Alexis Groon
<br/><i>My guess is this was more likely a gray whale, since only the tail was seen, &amp; no fin - also, there was a report of a gray at Bush Pt. 2 hours later, which could place a gray in this area at 1 pm - sb</i>

<br/>*<br/>
I headed out to look for the <b>orcas</b> - didn't find them until <b>12:45 pm</b>, they were at the south edge of Ft.

I watched for an hour from Lagoon Pt, they were VERY spread out, so difficult to count - but there were at the very least 10 or 12, including a calf or two &amp; a male. Not sure if it is J's or some of the Transients that have been around lately. I followed the whales as they continued south - at 2 pm they were passing by Bush Pt, some of them came closer to the Whidbey side, they seemed to be foraging &amp; going back &amp; forth some. At 2:25 pm they were spread out between the entrance to Hood Canal &amp; Pt. no Pt, at 2:35 pm I watched a group of them feeding just off the entrance to Hood Canal, but the pod was generally still heading SE.
