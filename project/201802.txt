While I was bird-watching from the <b>Edmonds Pier</b> on Monday, Feb 26, I spotted and photographed <b>a Gray Whale at 10:05am</b>. It was fairly close, just a few hundred yards southwest of the pier. It surfaced two more times before I lost sight of it. It was heading south. -Joe Sweeney
<br/>(<i>ID notes by Alie Perez, Cascadia Research: "This is another unknown animal, doesn't match the catalog. I don't think it is the left side of the gray seen on the 21st either."</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

February 26 - At about <b>1 am</b> we both heard what we were pretty sure <b>sounded like a large whale spouting</b>, then heard a few other sounds (sort of like we used to hear when they fed below us on North Bluff rd), I wonder if the grays feed a bit along here (south of Bush Point), it is really sandy/muddy - I know they feed in Useless bay. Anyway, hoping it is a(nother?) Gray and someone sees and photographs it first thing! -Susan Berta, Orca Netwrok

<b>Whale off President Point, Kitsap</b>, near Kingston. Not an orca. Heading North at <b>4:54 pm</b>. (<i>possibly one of the Sounders or Unknown grays who has been seen in this part of Puget Sound - alb</i>) -Joanne Graves

<b>T124A2B is a girl</b>! ..."Morning Star" arrived on scene with <b>T87, the T124A2s, and T124C at 1510</b>. The whales were still in <b>Rosario Strait</b> off the south side of Allan Island, near Williamson Rocks....Encounter report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 9.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

This afternoon I got out on the water with Maya's Legacy and we met up with the <b>T124As (including T124A1) in San Juan Channel</b>. While they were in travel mode heading slowly north when we got on scene, they soon went on a killing spree. As they headed <b>into Upright Channel</b> we saw them make three consecutive kills, most likely of harbor seals. On all three occasions dozens of gulls came down to join the feeding frenzy. We left them milling near <b>5:30 PM at the bottom of Harney Channel</b>. Whale fix! I was thrilled to get out on the water this afternoon with the T124As in San Juan Channel. This is calf T124A6 (born 2016) with eyes wide open on a high surfacing between mom T124A (left/back) and sibling T124A3. -Monika Wieland Shields - Orca Behavior Institute

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - San Juan Channel - <b>Transient Orcas in San Juan Channel off of Cattlepoint</b>. Time was <b>2:15</b>, watching them circle Whale Rocks where the Steller's sea lions are hauled out. Can't ID group from where I'm standing, but there appears to be 4 adults (possibly all females) and one baby. Traveling north through the channel. -Anne Marie Colbert 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:28 p.m -</b> Still moving up, but closer to <b>Lopez. Total of 5</b>, no males that are obvious. Parallel to Goose Island. Not in hunting mode seems like. Seals are vigilant. Harbor porpoise, 4? went racing the opposite direction. 
<br/><b>2:17 p.m. - </b>Stellars just started vocalizing alot! 
<br/><b>2:08 p.m. - Four orcas off Cattle Point</b>, one is young. Slow, off the lighthouse, heading north into San Juan channel. Three adults, one young. Don't see males, unless sprouters. At Whale Rocks, where Stellars are. I'm out with Birding Class. -Cher Renke

I've seen blows now twice at <b>4:20 and 4:25</b> further north so they are <b>northbound nearing Kingston</b> in very choppy seas and moody skies of sideways snow and Sun rays! From Kayu Kayu Ac Park Richmond Beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:12 p.m. -</b> Spotted the pod west of mid channel just south of yellow middle channel buoy between <b>Richmond Beach and Presidents Point, Kingston</b> while aboard ferry crossing to Edmonds. -Marilyn Armbruster  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:15 p.m -</b> Just saw them from the deck of the <b>Seattle to Bainbridge ferry</b>. It looked like there were three and they were headed North still on the west side  (of channel) but traveling more to the center of the channel. And it was pretty neat because the huge harbor crane vessel just had passed, so the vessel was the backdrop to our pictures. GREAT experience. Loving our Puget Sound today. -Heather Strassell 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:40 p.m. - </b>Pod went <b>East side of Bainbridge</b>. They are at <b>Eagle Harbor, heading north</b>. They are in no hurry. We have left them now.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

This morning, as the sun hit the water in blinding fashion, I got a call from Chris Hamilton with a report of "orca in the hood."  I ran to the deck in sub zero weather and 60 mph winds to see if I could see them.  I COULD!  They had just entered <b>Eld Inlet</b> (so they passed right in front of me without being detected) and they were all doing what I call the "Whale Happy Dance."  They were so active that I could hardly keep up.  Breach.  Tail slap.  Spy hop. Head stands. Pectoral slap.  Roll.  Repeat.  :)  I had to go inside to warm up.  And I could hear the tail slaps and breaches inside the house!  They stayed in this same are for a long time, with lots of tail slaps, breaching, spy hops and other social behavior that is common after they have made a 'kill' and that I missed witnessing (one of the photos shows the oil slick from that) and everyone was happy!  After some time, they traveled a bit further south into Eld, passing Sanderson Cove and on their way to Flap Jack Point.  About 20 minutes later, I could see the strong blows of the animals now exiting Eld Inlet near Cooper Point heading north with a purpose.  As they passed, I could see a lone and scared seal at the edge of the beach.  But <b>the whales were moving quickly north, mid channel</b>.  I lost sight of them in the high chop and biting north wind as they approached Harstine Island area.  I do not know if they went north up Dana Passage or hung a west and went toward Steamboat Island and waters in those inlets.  SO GRATEFUL!!!  As they faded out of sight, I sobbed.  Such a gift to be able to share a few moments with such magnificent animals.
<b>4:15 p.m. - Ts exiting Budd Inlet</b> heading north. That is Cooper Point Spit in the foreground. The body of water on the bottom is Eld Inlet.
<b>4:10 update</b>. The whales are <b>still in the Budd/Eld inlets</b> vicinity. They have circle around and headed into the entrance of Budd Inlet. Quickly swung around and headed north again on the far shore (toward Boston Harbor/Zangle Cove) and are now out of sight yet again. VERY hard to spot unless they are on their pattern - long dive followed by a three X surfacing series. I lost sight in the chop as they were headed north and if they keep on that trajectory, they are angled toward Dana Passage. 
<b>3:36 p.m. -</b> They are there again.  Almost missed them.  I was on the beach and as I came inside, I turned around and there they were heading east from Eld Inlet toward Zangle Cove.  Mid channel.  Long dives. VERY tough to see them due to chop and wind. 
<br/><b>1:08 p.m. -</b> They are still here. I can see them from my front room breaching on the <b>south side of Harstine</b> - even in huge whitecaps. Too far away for photos. Cannot tell if they are going north up Dana Passage or west toward Steamboat Island and inlets over there. 
<br/><b>12:35 p.m. - </b>They are now heading north and traveling fast. Porpoising and tail slapping along the way. Now on long dive. Mid channel heading straight to Harstine Island. I lost sight in the wind and whitecaps. 
<br/><b>11:47 a.m. - </b>I can still see them and now they are traveling south toward <b>Flap Jack Point</b>.  
<br/><b>11:37 a.m. -</b> Still in roughly the same place. I can't tell if they made a kill. Wild waves and a weird "patch/spot" on the water just north of where they are (photo viewed showed oil slick from kill - alb) They are taking a few long dives. Huge tail slaps, breaches, blows and other surface activity. Slightly and slowly heading south into Eld... 
<br/><b>11:05 am - Orcas in Eld Inlet</b>. They are just south of Cooper Point very active staying in the same place. Now heading into hot light (sun glare). LOTS of tail slaps a breaches. HUGE. Blows. <b>T124A2 Eld Inlet</b> this morning. A little tail-lobber sandwiched by great uncle <b>T124C and T87</b>. Eld Inlet. -Kim Merriman 
<br/>(<i>ID by Melisa Pinnow, CWR</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Approx. 8:00 a.m. -</b> Saw them (orcas) from <b>Otso Point</b> (Anderson Is., Puget Sound)...they were headed south west towards the end of Long Branch. Amazing. Wonderful way to start the day. -Ellen Ross Kaspi

February 21 - <b>North Puget Sound  - T137s - 3:58 p.m. -</b> Midchannel male dorsal out from Mutiny Bay plus a few hugging Whidbey side <b>N end of Double Bluff</b>. They gathered right here off PNP with feeding behavior, but soon spread out as they moved on heading NE towards S Whidbey. At least 4 -- that was so cool to walk onto the beach and have a big ol' spy hop right in front of me!! Didn't even have camera ready yet. 
<br/><b>3:35-3:45 p.m. -</b> Eyes on - 100 yards out from <b>Point no Point</b>... big spy hop now traveling NE at good clip passing Double Bluff and heading to Mutiny Bay up Admiralty! <b>T137A</b> northbound in Admiralty Inlet off <b>Point No Point. T137D, T137A, &amp; mom T137.</b> -Donna Van Renselaar 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:40 p.m. - passed Apple Tree Point Kingston, NB</b> steady pace. Several plus a male about 1/4 mile behind...Stinks to be home sick but for a few minutes of orca viewing, felt better! Pretty sure I saw one very young, one female, young male and an older male. <b>Matriarch T137 off Kingston...her big 16 year-old son T137A</b>. -Sara Frey 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:23 p.m. -</b> Pod is just on south side <b>Apple Cove Point, Kingston</b> heading towards row of home at Point. Male is on outside , maybe leading a bit, 1 female, 1 young and maybe 4th (female or juvie)? Still NB. Travel is slowish moving at surface but then 3-5 mintue dives they surface much further ahead than anticipated. Has made tracking them a bit more difficult than usual.  
<br/><b>1:10 p.m. -</b> pod resumed travel and is about to surface in front of <b>Kingston dock steady northbound</b> West side of channel, loosely spread. 
<br/><b>12:54 p.m. -</b> after long dive pod has moved far over to Kitsap side north of <b>Presidents Point</b>. Some surface action: tail lobs and maybe a spyhop. 
<br/><b>12:35 p.m. -</b> This pod is stealthy. They were either on prey or flipped...last northbound same spot. I moved closer and haven't seen them again since about <b>12:20</b>. 
<br/><b>12:12 p.m. -</b> May have stalled. They just made directional change and their location is actually mid channel between <b>Richmond Beach and Jefferson Head</b>.   
<br/><b>12:05 p.m. -</b> After hours of searching...Finally found them. Pod is southbound steady pace just south of <b>Jefferson Head</b> just west of mid channel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:58 a.m. - </b>At least<b> 3 orcas including a large male off SW Possession headed south</b>. -Toby Black 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

February 21 - South Puget Sound - <b>T87 (&amp; presumably T124C, T124A2s)</b>. At <b>7:38pm</b>, a pod of <b>orcas came by Arcadia Point</b> westbound. I could not see them, but we could hear them. No pics, too dark. -Pamela S. Burger 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
I saw, 2 perhaps 3 (they were far away by the time I got there) Orca heading out past <b>Boston Harbor Marina</b>. Someone had posted on a neighborhood page that they were heading out past <b>Burfoot Park in Olympia @4:45 at by 4:57</b> they were past the marina, heading out! -Brandee Crocker Kankaala 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:12 p.m. -</b> Done for the night. Lost them in the snow heading across from far shore and mid channel toward <b>Hunter Point</b> and Squaxin Island. Heading west toward Steamboat Island. 
<br/><b>4:53 p.m. - </b>Now turned around and heading north still on far shore and now north of the marina. Slow and long dives with a few frolics thrown in by the little one 
<br/><b>4:19 p.m. - They are in Budd Inlet heading south</b>. Slow surfacing series as they approach Boston Harbor. Very close to that shoreline. -Kim Merriman 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:44 p.m. - 2 orcas spotted heading south in Case Inlet</b> between Herron and Hartstene Islands. -Eric Bergson 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Weds <b>2:30 pm 2-3 orcas swimming south in Case Inlet</b>, south of Herron Island. -Charlotte Smothers 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Here is a VERY grainy image of both males from <b>8:30 this morning </b>as they were spotted south side of Squaxin Island heading west. <b>T87</b> and his pretty boy notch."
<b>8:10 a.m - </b>I could see <b>at least 5</b>, at least two bulls. Heading west toward <b>Steamboat Island</b>, When I first saw them they were slow surfacing.  Hardly any blows...they were doing slow surfacing and directional changes. (Prior to that...They were headed east in front of Squaxin toward Budd Inlet.) -Kim Merriman

Gray whale - February 21 - <b>2:00 p.m. - Gray whale off Olympic Beach, Edmonds</b>. The whale was pretty close, about as close as the fishing pier, I first saw it half way between the ferry dock and the pier, I thought it was a log, then it disappeared so I knew it was a whale. It surfaced again closer to the pier so I thought it was traveling south, but the photo shows it turned around and was headed north. I went south to see if I could see it again but I didn't. No blow/spout. -LeRoy VanHee

Double rarity. Well, you just never know. Snow is rare for us at sea level, so are orcas in our waters. Then one day you wake up and chase killer whales during a snowstorm. That makes these pictures are rather rare, and rather grainy, as the snow was coming down good while the whales came for a visit. I shot first from the Warren Ave bridge as they exited Dyes inlet, and then caught up to them at <b>Bachmann Park in Manette. There were two calves, two females, and a male.</b> They put on quite a show that thrilled all the numb toed watchers. -Steve Scholle Photography

Southern Residents - Below is a short summary of an encounter we had yesterday with some members of L pod that I thought you might be interested in. On February 13th, researchers from Marine Ecology and Telemetry Research, in collaboration with Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Cascadia Research Collective and the US Navy, conducted a small boat <b>survey out of Westport, WA for Southern Resident</b> killer whales. Weather conditions were excellent, and <b>members of L pod were encountered north of Grays Harbor, WA</b> during the latter part of a 91 nautical mile survey effort. Identification photos were collected of the whales encountered, and foot print follows to facilitate collection of prey remains and fecal matter were conducted, though no samples were observed. Additional surveys will be conducted throughout the winter and spring, weather and logistical constraints allowing.

February 12 - Today Lisa C Larsson and I spotted <b>a sperm whale in Johnstone Strait</b>. Lisa had been listening to and recording this whale from Orcalab for several days. The first and last acoustic recording of a sperm whale in Johnstone Strait was made by John Ford  in February 1984, but I am not aware of any confirmed sightings of this species in waters anywhere along the inner coast of BC until today! We managed to get some decent shots of it and the T137s as they swam past. Thanks to Paul Spng and Helena Symonds for tracking this whale acoustically and John for helping to verify that yesterday's acoustic recording was indeed of a sperm whale. -Jared Towers

<b>1300</b> - Hello, Today at 1pm from our boat we saw a pod of five killer whales <b>west of Dungeness Spit near Sequim</b>. They were heading west and had a very young calf. I believe there was an adult female and male and two smaller whales. The two smaller ones seemed closer in size to the adult female. -Jacqueline Laverdure, NOAA, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary Education and Outreach Coordinator.

Southern Residents - Center for Whale Research encounter with J pod: "...At about <b>1210</b>, a few killer whales were reported <b>in San Juan Channel</b>. Dave and Melisa hurried to Snug Harbor and left aboard "Orcinus" at 1250. With help from Jeanne Hyde, "Orcinus" located the first group of whales <b>a mile northwest of Yellow Island at 1316</b>. The first group was made up of <b>J16, J41, J42, J50, and J51</b> and they were slowly traveling northwest. Trailing few hundred yards behind them was another group that contained <b>J22, J36, J37, J38, J40, J45, and J49. J26</b> appeared further inshore toward the San Juan Island shoreline and paralleled the two groups while <b>J19 and J39</b> surfaced a few hundred yards ahead of everyone. <b>J27 and J31</b> also trailed behind the groups..."

Southern Residents - Wonderful to see <b>J-Pod</b> today! Several of us waited patiently at <b>Reuben Tarte County Park </b>today as J-pod plus L87 slowly made their way up <b>San Juan Channel</b>. They formed a big resting group as they passed Jones Island before turning towards Spieden Channel. It is the first time in a long time that I have seen them travel in a big tight group. We were all so focused on the big group that it was when we turned to leave Braunti spotted the <b>J17's and L87</b> heading strait for the park. All pictures taken from shore with 150-600mm lens and cropped! Enjoy! <b>J27 - Blackberry </b>on the right. Spieden Island in the background. <b>J35 Tahlequah and J46 Star. J46 Star with J47-Notch!</b> -Alison Engle

We got to see <b>J-Pod today! J-Pod turned up in San Juan Channel this afternoon</b>! As they turned into Spieden Channel they were nice and close to the San Juan Island shoreline.Seeing the whales is always a gift, but especially today after a week of gray rainy weather and not feeling well. The sun even came out for a few minutes as we waited for their approach to <b>Reuben Tarte County Park</b>! At first they were spread out and moving very slowly north, but as they neared they grouped up into what looked like a resting line with the dramatic landscape of Orcas Island behind them. On their last surfacing as they passed us, they made a distinct turn west towards Spieden Channel, so we re-located to a friend's property further north - good decision! The whales were still moving slowly and took their time getting there. While this wasn't my best photo of the day, I love it because it shows just how big <b>J38 Cookie</b> (right) has gotten, with <b>J27 Blackberry</b> for comparison on the left...
