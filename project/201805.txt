<b>Bigg's killer whales - 11:10 a.m -</b> They are here, out from <b>Fort Casey</b> veering across to Port Townsend. Viewing from Fort Casey. -Marilyn Armbruster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1028 </b>- We are with them now. Still northbound closer to peninsula side just south of<b> Marrowstone Point. T49A2</b> is following close behind them. -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:30 a.m - </b>we are leaving them still off of <b>Double Bluff</b>, slowly northbound feeding with lots of birds circling above. Closer to the Whidbey side.
<br/><b>9:15 a.m. - </b>San Juan Clipper has them <b>just off Double Bluff</b> aiming towards shore, moving slowly. T65As
<br/><b>8:30 a.m. -</b> Victoria Clipper V reports <b>a pod of orca across from Useless Bay</b> near the SE buoy. No direction given. -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wohoo! Nice to finally see some whales off <b>Lime Kiln </b>again this afternoon. The <b>T86As, T101s, and T124A2s</b> made their way south, and a few of them are shown here with the Canadian schooner Pacific Swift in the background. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, May 31, 2018

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We rounded out the month of May with orcas again! Today we traveled along the <b>north side of Orcas Island</b> to look for whales, and caught up with the<b> T101s and T86As</b> heading towards <b>Spieden channel</b>. This is the 3rd time we've found the T101s this May - but first time for the T86As. There were 7 whales and we had some great viewing as they meandered by Spieden Island. Homeward bound, inter-island, we found a lot of seals hauled out, harbor porpoise, a California sea lion, and several Bald eagles. And spectacular scenery all day. June is "Orca month" - so let's now see what's in store for the month of June. <b>The T86As. T86A (right), mom, born 1988, T86A3 in middle, born 2011, and T86A1 on left, born 2001.</b> -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

May 30 - <b>Harbor porpoise</b> at <b>Hood Canal Bridge</b> (north side) right now! the dorsal was very small and that's how I knew they weren't orcas I saw 3-4 fins, but there could have been more and they seemed to be heading alongside the bridge heading west ...it looked as tho they were in a big circle of an area rather than along each other going the same direction...(after further discussion and photo to compare: "The bottom left photo (harbor porpoise) is exactly what the dorsal looked like ..was a short fin, it was most likely a porpoise...) -Megan Blake

Passed <b>T65A6 off Apple Tree Point, Kingston about 5 pm</b>. Two in front, several and the new baby behind. They stopped north of the point for about 10 minutes and appeared to be on a hunt.

Rosario Strait - <b>1:40 pm. - </b>I had been watching them for awhile in <b>Rosario</b> and they had long down times. I was going off visual and Marine Traffic.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:52 a.m. - </b>I just found <b>T49A2 trailing the T65As</b>. 
<br/><b>10:59 a.m -</b> According to Justine  who's onboard with us today, the rest split and headed north as we continued south with 65As.
<br/><b>10:51a.m -</b> still southbound <b>Discovery Park but only seeing T65As</b> now. Grouped up together. Lost sight of the rest. -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:22 p.m. -</b> At least one group (<b>T65As</b> according to Renee and Justine) still in resting moving southbound, have passed West Point, Discovery Park, off Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle,  and are drifting more westerly approaching Yeomalt Point and Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge.
<br/><b>10:30 a.m - orcas</b> have moved more towards mid, spread out a little bit. They are directly out from <b>Shilshole Marina</b> now navigating many holiday weekend boaters...most of all behaving quite respectfully. 
<br/><b>10:00 a.m. - orcas </b>have grouped up and moved offshore. Currently off <b>Meadow Point</b>, north end Golden Gardens Park. Still moving slowly southbound.
<br/><b>9:40 a.m. - Carkeek</b> is the place to be! Pod (s?) are split in two groups about 1/2 mile apart. At least 2 males further down off the south end of Carkeek, mom <b>T65A, T65A6</b>, and others right off <b>Carkeek</b>!
<br/><b>9:20 a.m - </b>After relocating to <b>Carkeek Park</b> and having no luck finding them, Kevin Crosby arrived spotted <b>T65As &amp; T49A2 </b>just inside north end of the park. Pod is circling very lazily about 1/4 mile offshore. Water Is glassy calm!
<br/><b>8:40 a.m. - Pod</b> has drifted to east side mid channel as they continue southbound in resting mode. <b>Carkeek Park</b>, North Seattle would be good place to be next. 
<br/><b>8:10 a.m. - pod of ~ 6</b> is slowly making their way down the channel (west of mid) <b>between Kingston and Jefferson Head</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network 
<br/>(<i>ID's by Melisa Pinnow, CWR</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:30 a.m - orcas southbound around Kingston/Edmonds</b> ferry lanes moving slowly southbound with a bit of activity. I think T65As. -Photo by Sara Frey, May 28, 2018

<b>Gray whales</b> (North Puget Sounders &amp; friends) - May 28 - <b>1430</b> - Whale was swimming around probably feeding. It was white in color. I have a quick video but you can't see much (shows <b>gray whale</b>, see screen grab below -alb). Location: <b>Crescent Harbor</b> just off NAS Commissary. -Michael Head

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

May 28 - <b>1:49 p.m. - (central Puget Sound, out from Port Madison</b>) Looking for the whale reported earlier...we found it, is a <b>humpback</b>. Heading north east-ish, directionally towards Point Wells. Mid channel. (later notes Renee: This is one of the humpbacks we saw in the group of 3 yesterday and today was alone.) -Renee Beitzel 
<br/><i>Travels of "Neptune": S/he is match to 2nd whale in Tasli Shaw's video who was feeding with "Google" in Boundary Bay on May 4th.  (included in our WS Report dated May 8), and match to whale photographed by William Riggs morning of May 12th, between Lummi Island and Clark Island. (included in our WS Report dated May 22), and match to whale photographed by Barbara Howitt on May 21st, in this report below.</i>

Unidentified cetaceans - May 28 - <b>10:20 a.m -</b> I'm on a boat a bit <b>west of Agate Pass bridge</b> and saw a large spray and then the arch of what appeared to be an Orca off of <b>Point Bolin (Bainbridge)</b>. We were too far away and heading the opposite direction (we were EB toward the bridge) so didn't get to see any more. I did see a dorsal, and I thought I saw a white patch (though we were far away so I may have imagined the white). I didn't see the tail. My boat partner didn't see the exhalation, just the dorsal arching out of the water and down. He questioned if it was a porpoise, but it was way too large from as far away as we were to have been a porpoise and the exhalation was way too large, and the descent back into the water was too slow to have been porpoise. As far away as we were, the dorsal seemed large in proportion to what I saw of the back, so I'm inclined to still say Orca, not Humpback or Grey. -Christy Jobe

May 28 - <b>8:50 AM - </b>Maia at WSF's, relaying a report of <b>a small pod of juvenile orcas westbound in Thatcher Pass</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

~<b>4:15pm, just south of Edmonds</b>. We were 400 yards away (laser rangefinder). But here's the slam to the two boaters that went in front of the whales path. Even though you shut off and raised your outboards, getting that "right past your boat" photo for your kids is not legal. Stay out their path and don't stress the whales. We've had a lone whale come right by our boat a few years ago as the main pod passed 200 yards away. We were already drifting with engines off, so it was quite the experience, but we didn't intentionally get into the whales path. -Steve Marczewski

Coastal killer whales - I'm writing to report a possible orca sighting at Seal Rocks on Saturday, May 26th. I saw the request for reports yesterday at Hatfield Marine Science Center. Details:
<br/>Time: Approximately<b> 4pm</b> on 5/26
<br/>Total<b> number of whales: 1</b> (unknown if it was male or female)
<br/>Direction: Unsure-it moved in a circular pattern.
My daughter and I were descending the path from the highway in front of <b>Seal Rocks RV Cove</b> when we spotted the dorsal fin just to the left of the rocks. It was very close to shore but we were not able to catch it in a photo-it moved in a small circular counter-clockwise movement and then disappeared. We had been spotting gray whales frequently throughout the day in the same location, but this was very different! We both noticed it right away, but then didn't see it again in the three days we stayed there. -With best wishes, LeAnn Adam, Oregon State University

Spotted from <b>5:30 pm eastbound Seattle-to-Bremerton</b> ferry, <b>a solitary whale heading east into Rich Passage</b>, midway in the channel near salmon net pens. The captain announced that a spout had been seen - the ferry would be slowing its progress until we cleared the area where the marine mammal was spotted. A few moments later (6:05 pm, Tuesday, May 24) passengers were treated to four more spouts ahead of the slowed down ferry. Then it looked like the whale sounded, as we saw a wide fluke rise in the air and disappear below the water surface... and then nothing further.  We were looking into the sun, so I couldn't make out whether it was a small grey whale fluke or a large orca. Others on the ferry may have had a better view and/or photographs. Here is the approx. location where we saw the whale: 47.570491,-122.529671. -Brian Johnson, Bremerton

Hi, Here are a few photos of the gray whale that I saw today in Crescent Harbor. I hope they will be helpful in identifying it.....I'm not sure what the whale was doing, it kept rolling around and sticking its head out of the water. I haven't seen one behave like that before. -Mary Jo Adams
<br/><i>Lovely face of a gray whale. This is who for now we refer to as<b> Unknown #2</b>. This whale was first photographed by Mary Jo on April 9th in North Saratoga and s/he has been there ever since. Cascadia Research had no match for this whale.</i>

On <b>Pebble Beach, Camano Is, near Mabana Beach</b>, we had a thrilling Sunday morning yesterday,<b> 8:00 am</b>, when we awoke to <b>#531</b> lazily feeding right off our bulkhead. She rolled, twisted, turned in circles as she bulldozed through the mud. The water is shallow and we wondered how she could do it. She fed for about 40 minutes then headed south, leaving the water the color of dirt and our mouths still dropping. In the afternoon, at low tide, the seagulls jumped up and down in the puddles to work the huge horse clams up out of their holes. -Peg Boley

Humpback whales - May 20 - Today's scenic trip took us into Canadian waters, where we encountered <b>three humpback whales, including Split Fluke (BCX1068 b. 2006), between Active Pass and Point Roberts/Strait of Georgia</b>. These gentle giants were traveling in tandem, their powerful heart-shaped blows shimmering against the backdrop of the sun's glare. Some of our favorite pinnipeds, Steller sea-lions and Pacific harbor seals, gave us a cursory glance as we passed their rocky perch, leaving the Stellers to continue their argument (at least that's how it looked) as we wended our way among the San Juan archipelago. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea

We had a great day on the San Juan Clipper today! <b>Three whale species</b> in one day! We saw <b>gray whale #531</b> feeding close to the shore of Whidbey Island on our northbound trip. On the whale and sealife search we decided to check out an area that no other boats had searched yet and were rewarded by the T100s in Boundary Pass...just north of Skipjack Island. We left as they were crossing the pass toward Saturna Island! On our way back to Seattle, we saw several Minke whales feeding at Partridge bank. Yay whale trifecta!

Last Thursday Lennie and I had the most amazing experience with the <b>Southern Resident orcas off Estevan Point - North West of Tofino</b>. Initially the report was of 30 orcas, but <b>All of J pod, and members of K and L were seen</b>, with more whales on the horizon we could not get photos of. It is possible the entire population of Southern Residents was in the area! 
<br/><b>Southern Resident Orcas off Hesquiaht Harbour and Estevan Light</b> - I got a report of 30+ whales off Hotsprings Cove yesterday afternoon (May 17th). We got on scene at <b>5 pm and by then the pod was 5 miles west of Barney Rocks</b>. They had been milling for most of the afternoon according to other boats on scene. They also described foraging behaviours, which I observed when I was on scene. Our fish finder did show that there were large amounts of fish in the area! I wasn't sure who we had at first. It has been close to 4 years since I have seen southern residents so I was a bit rusty with ID's at first and I thought we were dealing with Northern Residents. Suddenly I recognized the great <b>L41! And then J27 and L25</b>.... Tasli helped with with some ID's through messenger. <b>L89</b> was also identified on scene. There were some whales further off shore that we didn't get to spend time with. For the most part they were quite spread out but near the end of our time with them they formed a tight group (J Pod anyways, from what I could tell, the L's were further out) and began travelling west at a consistent 5 knots. We left them at <b>7:13pm directly offshore of the Estevan Lighthouse</b>. -Marcie Callewaert John
<br/>(<i>ID notes by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research: <b>J41, J31, J39, J40, and J27</b></i>)
<br/>(<i>ID notes by Monika Wieland Shields based on reviewing ID's by Brendon Bissonnette and the photos herself:  "<b>All of J-Pod, the K13s, and L12 sub-group</b> were all identified in her photos - but she said there was more offshore that they didn't photograph and she thought it could have been enough whales for it to be all of them."</i>)

Gray whales (South Puget Sound) - May 14 - <b>Budd Inlet </b>- Update from CRC with link: <b>A gray whale</b> was spotted this morning near Olympia, WA.

A spectacular Mother's Day on the Salish Sea - we traveled a long way to find a humpback out by <b>Constance Bank</b>, and as we were almost home our eagle-eyed Captain Eric spotted Transient/Biggs killer whales by Allan Island - what a catch! They were the <b>T101s and T102</b> and we had some amazing viewing of this grouping of <b>4 whales</b>, as they passed <b>Deception Pass</b> and headed south-west. Along with Tufted Puffins, seals, a few harbor porpoise, and dead calm seas, it truly was a super Mother's Day!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

May 13 - Strait of Georgia - On the Western Explorer II today, we started out with reports of<b> Minke whales down to the south of San Juan Island</b>. We were treated to <b>perhaps 8-10 different Minke whales </b>feeding in an area. We had Minkes on all sides of us as they zigged and zagged looking for forage fish the birds were targeting. After an incredible counter with those lovely baleen whales, we got word some Bigg's Killer whales had been spotted way up to the north! The Western Explorer II's speed allowed us to head up and see these whales as well. What an amazing way to spend Mother's Day with our guests! <b>T63 Chainsaw in Strait of Georgie near Matia Island.</b> -Western Prince WW (see Traci Walter photo below)

In <b>Yaquina Bay (Newport)</b> on Thursday 05-10-18 at approx. <b>9:05 pm </b>PST from the end of the public fishing pier near the South Beach Marina looking north-ish toward the Coast Guard HQ, I saw <b>a lone, presumably male(?)

It was getting dark enough at that time for the CG HQ's lights all to be on, dark enough that I was surprised my camera would even attempt to take a picture, but attached is the photo I got as the Orca headed out of the bay toward the jetties....I've seen orcas in the bay before, and as before, this one simply appeared to be cruising around, checking things out.

<b>11:17 a.m. -</b> pod is now slightly <b>north of Eglon, Kitsap still heading north</b> towards Point No Point very much on Kitsap side. Still, the only boats on scene that I can see are: PSE Saratoga, w/Red Head approaching from north and Island Explorer coming from Possession. I've not seen one other boat go near this family the two hours I have been watching, which has been a huge welcome relief considering the many hundreds of boats out there for opening boating day.
<br/><b>10:23 a.m. - pod is north of Kingston dock</b>. And for record and has been a relief: I've not seen one private motorboat approach the pod, nor any of the gazillion sailboats, they are all just going about their business boating while the whales navigate them on this day of mass human water activity. Only the Clipper and Saratoga have been on scene. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

May 4 - Budd Inlet - <b>3:18 p.m. -</b> It is back. Just now. Heading south again into <b>Budd Inlet</b> - just at the entrance passing between Burfoot Park and Cooper Point spit across the waterfront each other. Same surfacing behavior....a small blow and shallow arch followed by a larger, more robust blow followed by a significant slow taller arch. Then a long dive. My husband is home and HE GOT TO SEE IT!!! It's not moving anywhere very fast. It never fluked while I was watching it....but it is very distinctive in spine/knuckles and lice, etc. So it is clearly I.D.able for either past of future images. -Kim Merriman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

~<b> 9:00 a.m - Noon - Gray whale in Budd Inlet</b>. Headed south passing Boston Harbor on a very slow surfacing series. Two surfaces (the first one faint, then the second one more robust) with more of its back cresting the surface...Very distinct 'knuckles' as it looks like a humpback whale but with the dorsal curve heading the opposite direction. It did two of these series and then long dives....Cascadia Research was contacted and they put a team on the water. The whale eventually turned around and headed back north, on the Cooper Point peninsula side. Direction of slow and wandering travel is still heading north. And still in Budd Inlet. -Kim Merriman

May 4 - <b>Two juvenile humpback whales</b> have been feeding in <b>Boundary Bay</b> over the last two days. One is a two year old known as "<b>Google</b>", the <b>2016 calf of BCX1188 "Jigger"</b>, originally documented by the Marine Education &amp; Research Society. Humpback whales feed on a rage of zooplankton and small fish, and it was clear that Google and friend were feeding on some species of zooplankton rather than fish like herring, as local whale watchers could see dense swarms of the small creatures in the water where these two whales were lunge feeding.

Day report: First saw <b>T65As around 11:15 am</b> just north of the town of <b>Eldon</b> with them being closer in until <b>Triton Cove State Park around noon</b> (for about a half hour, was truly orca blessed, to capture some awesome moments quickly). About Triton Cove SP is where they started to move out further east near mid channel, but <b>heading north towards up into Dabob Bay</b>. Met up with my friend Alisa just after that and we stopped at a few other places to watch them and ran into new friends...we landed at <b>Point Whitney</b> north of <b>Brinnon</b>, beautiful place. We all met there for at least 2+ hrs patiently waiting for the orcas to come back out of <b>Dabob Bay (north bay)</b>, they had to, they could not swim any further north at that point, its a dead end. Beautiful beach and mountains on our left side and the water on our right side. Met some awesome whale outdoorsy enthusiasts....loved this one family, mama and her 3 incredible young children, the daughter who I think she told me was 8, she could run the Langley Whale Center on her own, she knew so much. Their mama is amazing; just watching the dynamics of this family was pretty cool...Point Whitney is also where Alisa and I met up with Susan and Howie, Sweet Briar Pup and after leaving there, met up with Ken. To be with those four friends warmed my heart to pieces. A few of my photos I am pleased with. I love the stillness of the waters and reflections. -Marilyn Armbruster

Dall's porpoise - May 1 - <b>~6:30 p.m. -</b> While we (Susan Berta, Howard Garrett, Marilyn Armbruster, and myself along with others) were on shore watching the T65As across <b>Dabob Bay in Hood Canal</b>, Howard caught notice of these <b>Dall's</b> in his binoculars. This pod of Dall's (at least 3) were much closer to use on the Hwy 101 side off north end of<b> Seal Rock Campground, Brinnon</b>. So exciting and sweet to see these Dall's who used to be more abundant in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea and are rare these days.
