<h3><center>April 2004 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>April 30, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
At <b>7PM</b> we were surprised to see a pod of <b>Orca</b> from <b>Cherry Point</b> along the Strait of Georgia in Whatcom County (48 50' N, 122 43' W). We have frequented this area for years and this is the first time we have ever seen Orca here. We estimate 20-30 individuals including males. The pod was spread out for a couple of miles. They were moving south, with some individuals within 1500 feet of shore.
<br/>Carl Weimer
<br/>Re-Sources
<br/>*<br/>
Peter Hamilton of Lifeforce called in a report of J pod off Cherry Pt. at around 5:30 pm.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas</b> here at <b>7:30 AM</b> this morning just south of <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> milling around for awhile enjoying this pretty day....and then headed north.
<br/>Helen King
<br/>The Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We found <b>J's</b> at the T10 can between the North and South arms of the Fraser River around 11 am this morning. They reached the Iona Jetty by the airport before turning south at <b>11:45 am</b>, moving slowly, mainly milling. 
<br/>What a great day for whales. 
<br/>Claire
<br/>Vancouver Whale Watch 
<br/>*<br/>
Saw a lone <b>gray</b> about <b>5PM</b>, heading fairly rapidly north to Mabana (west Camano). Once it reached the shallows off Mabana, it spent considerable time feeding, with lots of flukes and tail fins.  Gradually proceeded north
along the shallows until it was out of sight.  Also saw a lone <b>gray</b> about <b>11:30 AM</b> mid channel between Mabana and East Point.  Probably the one already reported from Whidbey.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
2 grays at <b>2:40pm</b> in middle of saratoga passage heading slowly N. directly west of Mabana Shores.
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/>*<br/>
We have a single <b>gray</b> passing by Bells Beach right now (<b>10:43 am</b>). Heading south bound, mid passage. So Langley, be on the lookout soon.
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
I heard <b>J pod</b> on the hydrophone at <b>0010</b> this morning. I was hearing calls at least until <b>0030</b> but they were getting drowned out by a couple of freighters. I dont know what direction they were going.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
<br/>San juan Island
<br/><br/>
<b>April 29, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>6 pm</b> - Jim Maya called to report <b>J pod</b> East of <b>Race Rocks</b> heading east - also saw Stellar &amp; Calif. Sea Lions -
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett called at <b>5 pm</b> to report 2 <b>gray whales</b> at the mouth of Holmes Harbor, Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
Mike called back at <b>5:20 pm</b> to report that it's <b>3 gray whales</b> at the mouth of Holmes Harbor, including Patch &amp; one smaller whale. Cascadia Research is on board so hopefully we'll get further ID's.
<br/>*<br/>
Mike called again (lucky guy!) at <b>6 pm</b> to report another <b>gray</b> south of Hat Island, between Hat Island and Everett.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Jpod</b> inbound from the West, first report they were off East Sooke Park (West of Race Rocks at <b>1600</b>). My last report was South of Victoria at <b>2000</b> still going East.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Well I missed the spouts of two <b>grays</b> in front of Bells Beach but spotted them spouting in between Camano and Fox spit at <b>6:40 pm.</b> (approx 4 miles north of Langley),
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:10pm</b> big lone <b>gray</b> meandering Northwest past East Point close to shore headed into the sunset (NW).
<br/>David Day
<br/>Fox Spit Rd
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Well <b>grays</b> can be so unpredictable. The two I saw earlier, turned south and came back to Bells Beach. (<b>8:35 PM</b>) They have been out here for a while going every which way. They are VERY close to shore and cant think of a better way to end this day. Beautiful sunset and calm waters, with the noisy blows from two such majestic creatures. We are certainly blessed. 
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:30 pm</b> - I'm pretty sure I could hear a few puffs in the distance every few minutes, followed by gulls talking, so I think the <b>grays</b> weren't too far from Greenbank.
<br/>Susan
<br/>*<br/>
Mary Pacher (neighbor) left a message at <b>2 pm</b> that there is another huge <b>gray</b> off North Bluff/Greenbank, heading SE.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> continuing westward along the coast while watching the sunset at Deadman's Bay, San Juan Island. That was near to <b>8:30 PM</b>
<br/>peter delorenzi
<br/><br/>
<b>April 28, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Mary Pacher called this morning to say they had a large, loud <b>gray</b> whale close to their bluff (North Bluff, N. of Greenbank - Saratoga Passage) at <b>10 pm</b> - and I was inside getting the whale sighting report out &amp; missed them!
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>J Pod</b> between Eagle Pt. and False Bay, West Side, San Juan Is.,
at <b>6:30 PM</b>, milling and feeding...No direction.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I left <b>J pod</b> at <b>1330</b> off the south end of Stuart Island heading north toward Turn Point. There were several boats still with the whales and I heard a rumor they were coming back south from Turn Point. All of <b>J pod</b> was present and accounted for.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We had <b>J-pod</b> pass the house heading North around <b>11:30 AM</b>,...J-Pod heading south around <b>3:30 PM</b>.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
...about <b>7:15 PM</b>, and watching 2 <b>Grays</b> passing by Bells Beach and they are about mid passage...may be heading south toward Langley. Hope im not the only spotter.
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Three <b>grays</b> leisurely cruised below our bluff at <b>6:45</b> headed East.
Sooooo nice to see them up close!  
<br/>Dave Day
<br/>Fox Spit Road, WhidbeyIsland
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>grays</b> moved slowly from Langley toward Sandy Point at <b>12:30 p.m.</b>, feeding as they rounded Sandy Point headed for Clinton at <b>1 p.m.</b> One was noticeably larger than the other--perhaps the same pair we've seen before.
<br/>Marty Loken and Marjiann Moss
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
I spotted two large <b>gray whales</b> this morning around <b>7:30 AM</b>, heading north in Saratoga Pass about 500 yards off shore from North Bluff Rd.
<br/>Carolyn Mercer
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at <b>7:40 am</b> to report <b>J pod</b> off the W. side of <b>San Juan Island</b> at Hannah Heights, traveling north. He called again to say they had turned south, then headed north again and were nearing the Lime Kiln Lighthouse/Whale Watch Park at <b>10 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
One <b>gray whale</b> traveled slowly feeding on South end of Camano West side.  Continued to travel North west into the middle of the passage at <b>8:l5am</b>. Stayed at Mabana only l0 minutes.
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>8:20 pm</b> heard the whoosh! whoosh! of <b>grays</b> right off our bluff! We went to our neighbor's overlook, &amp; watched 2 grays feeding off Hidden Beach (north of Greenbank), moving slowly to the north. A wonderful way to end the day!!
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie 
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>Grays</b> heading north on the Camano side of Saratoga passage, passed
Mabana about <b>5PM</b>.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Have been watching 2 grays feeding about 250 yards out at First &amp; Park for the last 15 minutes (6 am).  Their whole bodies are visible because the shallow water.  When the tide goes out you can see the indentations from their feeding.  What a way to start your day.
Bettina Fisher, Langley
<br/>*<br/>
I watched two <b>gray whales</b> feeding in the shallow water off of <b>Langley</b> this mornin, from <b>5 AM - 6 AM</b>.  They would feed, rolling on their sides for about 20 minutes and then head out into the deeper water circle back and feed again.  The 2 whales did this three times and then headed off toward Camano Island. I believe they then headed east.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>*<br/>
...one gray whale quietly feeding at Mabana (W. <b>Camano</b>) <b>8:00 am</b> heading slowly north in shore over tidal flats consuming ghost shrimp, leaving numerous pits for us observe at low tides.   
<br/>Dodie at Mabana Camano
<br/><br/>
<b>April 25, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
There were also <b>grays</b> off of Scatchet Head (Cultus Bay)--due south out quite a bit--over a mile off shore, so very hard to report any details. Not sure how many whales were present, but saw spouts for at least two hours--between <b>11AM and 1PM.</b>
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of one <b>gray whale</b> south of Hat Island, heading north at <b>5:40 pm</b>
<br/>*<br/>
We saw two <b>grays</b> and one of them actually dove and stuck his tail out of the water at <b>7:35 PM.</b> They were actually quite close to shore off Mukilteo's Chennault Beach between Harbour Pointe and Olympic Terrace which is south of the Mukilteo Ferry. They were heading north, spouting and seemingly following the shoreline.
<br/>Janet Eaton, Mukilteo.
<br/>*<br/>
Two more <b>gray whales at 6:40 a.m.</b> off the west end of First St in <b>Langley</b>, leisurely feeding close along the shoreline, and making those wonderfully loud and distinctive whale  blowing noises - traveling slowly east toward downtown.
<br/>Sharen Heath
<br/>Langley
<br/><br/>
<b>April 24, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
...at <b>Camano Island</b> State Park, a little after <b>1 pm</b> the <b>humpback</b> went past the park traveling NW. It showed us it's tail three times and spent about twenty minutes working it's way through our field of vision.
<br/>Jeff Wheeler
<br/>Park Ranger
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J's</b> as reported by Jim Maya <b>in the am</b> off the west side of <b>San Juan Is</b>. Last seen still going S.W. at <b>1900</b> about 10 miles S. of Victoria.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called to report <b>J pod</b> at Middle Bank, off <b>San Juan Island at 11am</b> and 1 <b>gray whale</b> between Utsalady (N. Camano Island) &amp; Polnell Pt. (Oak Harbor, N Whidbey Island) at <b>4:15 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Two Grays, Patch and Trim Tail, off Spee-Bi-Dah today at <b>8:30 am</b> feeding for about 10 minutes.
<br/>Malcomb Lindquist
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Maya reports J pod off Mitchell Pt, west San Juan Island, first heading north at <b>8:55 am</b>, then turning south at <b>9:13</b>, should be at Lime Kiln Park by noon - a great day for watching orcas from Whale Watch Park for those of you on San Juan Island!
<br/><br/>
<b>April 23, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
...two grays feeding not far off the shores of the west end of First St, Langley - still visible beginning about <b>8pm</b>. I followed them downtown, viewing them from the minipark and "boy who never tires of the view" sculpture, and then Dang! if they didn't turn right around and head back to MY HOUSE just up the hill!!! So I returned and sure enough I could hear them feeding off my backyard - an hour earlier than last night.  
<br/>Sharen Heath
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of 2 grays between Hat Island and Everett at <b>11 am</b>, with one of them <b>spy-hopping!</b> He said it was the classic spy-hop, head out of the water taking a look around - this is something else we don't often see grays do in these waters, yet see below for another report of a spy-hopping gray from Thursday evening.....
<br/>*<br/>
Ed Young of Whidbey Island Kayaking called in a report of 2 grays at <b>10:30 am</b> off Langley Marina headed north; then at <b>11:30 am</b> he saw 1 gray one mile north of the marina.
<br/>*<br/>
Sometimes it is a good thing when BC Ferries are behind schedule. Today at about <b>11 a.m</b>. we saw a group of 6-8 orcas hugging the shoreline of
Galiano Island at the east end of Active Pass. Lots of jumping by the younger, smaller whales, and tail-slapping too. 
<br/>David R. Boyd
<br/>Pender Island
<br/>*<br/>At <b>11:50 am</b> a friend of ours spotted 4 Orcas on the ferry going through Active Pass. There is no ID on the whales, but they were east bound through Active. Possibly J's?
<br/>Cedric
<br/>Vancouver Whale Watch 
<br/>*<br/>
Karen Eaton of Greenbank called at <b>3:40 pm</b> to let us know a gray whale was off Holmes Harbor Estates (just n. of the Greenbank Farm), heading south.
Right in our neighborhood, &amp; I missed it!
<br/>Susan
<br/>*<br/>
Susan, I just saw a whale at <b>6 PM</b>. Now, I am fairly good at identifying but I am not sure if this was a gray or a humpback. My inclination is that it was a humpback. I saw only one heading north, spouting twice and a roll with a small amount of tail showing. I am in Mukilteo, south of the ferry--in the Harbour Pointe area. It was more toward the Mukilteo side than Whidbey.  This was so cool.
<br/>Janet Eaton, Mukilteo
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw 4 spouts between Langley and Camano, closer to Camano and headed that way. (About <b>7 PM</b>) Also heard that at least 2 were feeding near Langley at 8:30 this morning and at 9 last night.

<br/><br/>
2 grays feeding at Mabana Shores on W. Camano from <b>5:00pm until 6:30pm</b>, moving s. slowly. 2 grays in middle of saratoga passage at 5:30pm, then they traveled to the entrance to Elger Bay. These are 2 separate pairs. The Mabana Shores Grays were one large and one considerably smaller. They stayed together feeding and moved off down the tidal flats together.   
<br/>Dodie on Camano
<br/>*<br/>
...between <b>9-9:30 p.m</b>., TWO GRAY WHALES spent time leisurely feeding not far off the banks of the west end of First Street, (Langley) traveling slowly south. They were VERY LOUD in their breathing.  While there was little light in the night sky, we could see their large dark "shadow" bodies in the water, possibly one large, one small, judging by their shapes and the volume of their breathing sounds.  One was very, very loud!
<br/>Sharen Heath
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
...at about <b>9 pm</b> 2 greys were feeding close to shore on the west end of Langley. Went went to the edge and listened to them breath. They stayed around for about 45 minutes. Seems like they are finally starting to hang out on the Langley side more. 
<br/>Deborah Koff-Chapin
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
When I saw the Gray in Saratoga Passage at <b>7:30 P.M</b>., (which was actually heading South) at one point it's head was sticking straight up out of the water, stationary. What was that about? is that spy hopping? 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>2:15 pm</b>, I am watching 2 grays out front of Bells Beach, about 3 miles north of Langley and slowly heading south toward Langley. There are much closer to Whidbey than Camano. Just identified one of the grays as Patch. There was a white, football shaped spot on the right side just in front of the tail. 
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>3:30 PM</b> I spotted 2 grays between Langley and Mabana on
Camano, pretty much along the Whidbey shore. Watched them for a half hour
as they leisurely moved north to East Point. I was about to leave the
beach, when I spotted another 2 grays just coming in sight between Sandy
Point, and Pebble Beach on Camano. They  were moving fairly rapidly close
to the Camano shore, just off the drop off. When they reached the sandy
spit off Mabana, they stopped and fed for a considerable time. By then, the
two Whidbey whales were also visible mid channel between East Point and
Mabana. Four whales in sight at once!
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Leo Shaw of the Seattle Aquarium just called with an exciting report - Tom Schaffer of the "Good Time" sighted a <b>humpback off Alki Pt</b>, heading south in the shipping lanes <b>at 11:20 am</b>! This could be the same one that was sighted between Saturna Island &amp; Orcas Island &amp; heading south on April 18th. We've had other sightings of humpbacks in Puget Sound - Ken Balcomb spotted one off the Kitsap Peninsula in March 2 years ago, &amp; we had one off Whidbey last July.
<br/>Susan
<br/><br/>
<b>April 21, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
adult grey whale just north of kayak point at <b>11 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Elliott Menashe called to report a gray whale between S. Whidbey, close to Waterman dock &amp; Hat Island at <b>7:30 pm</b>, heading north.
<br/>*<br/>
Gail Fleming called to report 1 or maybe 2 gray whales in front of Langley, heading north at <b>7:30 pm</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 20, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Transient T61 off Victoria this afternoon just wandering around, seen going back towards Race Rocks at <b>1600</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw one, probably two grays across from Sandy Point, just north of
Camano Head, <b>1:30 PM</b>. Saw enough blows to guess at two by the positioning, and some body exposure. They were pretty close to the Camano side.
<br/>Marjiann Moss
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from Vicki Madsen of Tulalip Shores at <b>9:22 am</b>, reporting 1 (possibly 2) gray whale(s) heading south along Camano Island heading around Camano Head up into Port Susan.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 19, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
2 (possibly 3?) grays way over on the Mukilteo side, just north of the ferry terminal at <b>8:45 am</b>. Another 2 grays between close to the Whidbey side between Glendale &amp; Possession Pt. at <b>9:15 am</b>.
<br/>
2 (possibly 3) grays south of Tulalip, heading SE toward Everett at <b>4:45 pm</b>. 
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie
<br/>*<br/>
A lone grey whale at <b>9:05am</b> in the distance toward Skachet Head...saw the flukes and a couple of spoutings.
<br/>Diana Bublitz
<br/>Clinton
<br/><br/>
<b>April 18, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
We got to see a small-ish, perhaps 30-40', <b><i>Humpback</i></b> this afternoon, northwest of East Pt., Saturna Is. Vancouver Whale Watch found it late this <b>AM</b>. Just as we got there he/she breached in the distance, and a few moments later, much closer.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>

Two Grey whales <b>7:20 am</b> at Spee-Bi-Dah (Port Susan). (48.09,  122.32) They seemed to be just passing through. They were only around for about 5 minutes which is unusual. They usually feed for at least 20 minutes in the 1/2 mile in front of us. One was the one we call "Trim Tail". Got a really good look at the tail this time and it is the right side of the tail that is damaged, not the left as we previously reported. Did not get good look at other.

2 grays at Mabana Shores (Camano Island) at <b>9:30am</b>. My interpretation is that it was a mother and calf. My observation was of a Large adult covered in barnacles with a smaller whale, one third the size of the adult. The smaller whale stayed close to the side of the adult (extremely close). They fed for an hour and moved off to the drop off area and proceeded N. into the passage.
