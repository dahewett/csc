<br/><br/>
The best report I have came from my son at <b>7:30-8am</b>. "WHALES!" at Lime Kiln Lighthouse about 20 animals passing by with NO BOATS escorting! We later found out it was <b>J pod</b>.
<br/>Vickie Doyle,
<br/>Kent, WA
<br/>*<br/>
0830 - There are <b>Orcas</b> in Open Bay, right outside of Snug Harbor Marina, north west side, San Juan Is. right now. Milling. Most likely J Pod. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters
<br/>*<br/>
...<b>J-Pod</b> passing by (west side San Juan Island). They were spread out, with Ruffles (J-1) about a mile offshore while the rest of the group moved slowly North closer in. They weren't in any hurry and we caught up to them later in the day near Active Pass. We last saw J's heading into Active Pass on their way to Pt. Roberts.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Mr/Ms. <b>Minke</b> whale slowly cruising south with the tide, <b>9:45 am</b> (~same time as last 3 days) between Pt. Partridge and Ebey's Landing on west side of Whidbey.
<br/>Al Lunemann
<br/>Coupeville
<br/>*<br/>
Mr./Ms. <b>Minke</b> now moving north approaching Pt. Partridge ~ 1/2mile from shore, <b>2:30 pm</b>.
<br/>Al Lunemann
<br/>Coupeville
<br/><br/>
<b>May 30, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Approx. 12 <b>orca</b> whales, four miles west of Sandy Point, heading south toward Lummi Island <b>7:30pm</b>
<br/>Zachary Greer
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Lpod</b> off Sombrio Pt. at <b>0730</b> today going west
<b>J's</b> top end of Rosario, well last I heard.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
A single <b>Minke</b> slowly cruising south on west side of Whidbey Island, between Pt. Partridge and Ebey's Landing  <b>8:45 am</b>.

<br/><br/>
What a great whale weekend! We seen L pod come in from atop of Mt. Young at around <b>3pm</b>4-4:30 or so south of Lime Kiln from the shore with about two dozen plus boats around them.
<br/>Vickie Doyle,
<br/>Kent, WA
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>L Pod</b> headed west past Victoria this evening at <b>7ish</b>...<b>J Pod</b> was coming down Rosario past Anacortes at the same time.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters
<br/>*<br/>
Err, well, at the end of a long day, this is the best summary I can come up with. We had almost all of <b>L pod</b> minus the part of the L12's who were photographed with K's off Tofino a couple of weeks ago. L pod was incredibly spread out for the whole time we were with them, often in rather crappy weather of course.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
This is to let you know that <b>L pod</b> was last seen heading west across the Victoria waterfront at approximately <b>7:30 pm</b>.
<br/>Kim Stevenson
<br/>*<br/>
Peter Hamilton of LifeForce reported <b>J pod</b> off Pt. Roberts in the morning, with L's further out in the Strait; in the afternoon J's were in Rosario Strait, at <b>3:30</b> at Alden Bank.
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called in to report that <b>L's</b> were at Kellett Bluff at <b>2:15 pm</b>.
At <b>6 pm</b> he had at least the L25's off Lime Kiln, very spread out.
<br/>*<br/>
Our <b>1000</b>, had contact with <b>L's</b> off Monarch Hd. just before noon,
Cedric, Jim Maya and myself were plotting as best we could from Pt. Roberts going to East Pt. about <b>1100</b>.
Sounds like they are on their way to Race Rocks at <b>2041</b>.
<br/>2 <b>Humpbacks</b> reported in the Porlier pass area this afternoon 2.5 miles east going S.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
...between Salmon and Hein Bank...we did get to see the Minke.
<br/><b>L POD</b> finally arrived in the San Juans! Very spread out, with glassy water and cloudy skies, the whales put on quite the show with lots of breaches, cartwheels, tailslaps. Welcome back gang! As we headed in, we heard reports of <b>J-Pod</b> in Rosario Strait heading South, and <b>L-Pod</b> heading east.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>Minkes</b> off Partridge Point, NW. Whidbey Island, heading N-NW close to the shore at <b>2:40 pm</b>.
<br/>Called in by Sue 
<br/>*<br/>
Steveston Seabreeze spotted two <b>humpbacks</b> on the east side of Porlier Pass (N. of Galiano Island, Gulf Islands) at <b>14:30</b> and whales appeared to be south bound.
<br/>Cedric Towers
<br/>Vancouver Whale Watch 
<br/>*<br/>
The latest on <b>L Pod</b>'s location as of <b>12:45pm</b>:
John Boyd of San Juan Excursions just called in with L's coming down Plumper Sound, heading toward Stuart Island &amp; Turn Pt. at 12:40 pm.
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called with <b>L's</b> spread out in Boundary Pass, headed toward Turn Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
One or two <b>Minke whales</b> moving south, Ebey's Landing (W. Whidbey Island) at <b>11 am</b> mixed in with a flock of gulls &amp; an eagle  and a submarine moving in....
<br/>Al Lunemann,
<br/>Coupeville
<br/><br/>
<b>May 28, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
We received a call from John Cramer, reporting 8 orcas, including some calves, at the entrance of Humboldt Bay, California in the early morning hours.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:25 pm</b>: Two <b>grays</b> working the shallows headed to Bells Beach right past East Point and below our bluff just now (saratoga passage, N. of Langley).
<br/>David Day
<br/>Fox Spit Rd.
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Sunny skies returned as we headed out near Cattle Point (San Juan Island) today. <b>J-Pod</b> was about as spread out as I've seen, in groups of 3-5.  Lots of feeding activity, and one of the younger whales appeared as if they wanted to set the record for most breaches in one minute.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report <b>J pod</b> off False Bay, west San Juan Island at <b>5:30 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Marilyn Joyce of Canada's DFO just called with an update on <b>L pod</b>'s travels down the east side of Vancouver Island. John Ford &amp; Graeme Ellis have been out with L pod as they traveled south, &amp; at <b>4 pm</b> they were between Hornby &amp; Denman Islands (halfway between Campbell River &amp; Nanaimo).
<br/>*<br/>
A juvenile <b>humpback</b> was spy-hopping and breaching about 1000 yards off of the Tacoma ferry dock and boathouse at <b>10:30 AM</b>. Identification was possible as it was completely clear of the water on several jumps.
<br/>Dave Stevens
<br/>Gig Harbor
<br/>(<i>this humpback has been observed in Puget Sound by Cascadia Research staff as well - sb</i>)
<br/><br/>
<b>May 27, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Met up with <b>J-pod</b> off of Cypress Island. Great look at J-11 and her spunky calf. Sub groups were separating and then rejoining together during the time we observed them. J-22's all cruising together- J2 did a bow pass next to us when we were stopped that was as close as any I had ever seen. Her breath smelled sweet and clean. Half a dozen breaches on the cruise down.
<br/>Victoria Kirkland, Naturalist
<br/>Island Adventures
<br/>*<br/>
The news of the day is that <b>some of L pod showed up in Blackfish Sound late this afternoon</b>; OrcaLab was able to see open saddle patches &amp; at least 4 males. Jim Borrowman took photographs and positively ID'd L41 &amp; L72. They observed about 20 whales. They were heading east in the Strait toward Robson Bight, &amp; will likely show up down south soon. It is not known if any of the K pod whales were present, or if all the L's were present. We'll let you know as we get more news, keep an eye open for any fins out there!
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>J Pod</b> today at <b>6:00 PM</b> headed back toward Eagle Pt..  from about 4 miles off of Lime Kiln Park, west side, San Juan Island. Unusual
behavior. They were headed north, as has been their custom for the last
couple of weeks, or so, and then they turned south west toward Discovery
Island, like they had heard the K/L Pod siren song. They stopped, milled
around for a while then headed back toward San Juan Island.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters
<br/>*<br/>
A very unpleasant morning. We went S.E. towards Hein Bank and over towards Iceberg Pt. We got the call of <b>transients</b> at Race Rocks, a pounding run in the pouring rain to find T20 and T21, missed the seal kill. In the afternoon a toss up to go meet the J's at the bottom of Rosario or west to relocate T20 and T21, the T's won or lost. We left them off shore near Sooke on a angle for Pillar Pt. Race Rocks had 11 El. Seals and 30 Steller and the same # of California's. <b>J's</b> went up the west side. Very cold and wet day.
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG
<br/>Victoria, BC
<br/>*<br/>
Clouds and rains didn't deter us from going out in hopes of seeing <b>J-Pod</b>. A report of J-Pod in Rosario, so we headed East, and found them very spread out at the bottom of Rosario Strait, heading West towards Iceberg. For the most part, the whales stayed in groups of 2-3 until Iceberg, when about 8-10 bunched together as they passed the boat. Large waves out in the water made Ruffles &amp; Granny practically pop out their chins as they came up for air.  As we headed towards Cattle Point, we saw our first sighting of 3 Pomarine Jaegers as they flew past the bow.
<br/>Alison Engle &amp; John Boyd (JB) 
<br/>Naturalists, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
We received a report of 3 <b>orcas</b> north of <b>Crescent City, CA</b>, heading south at <b>7:10 am</b> this morning, from David Barrett.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 26, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Yes, <b>J-pod</b> here on the west side of San Juan Island just south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse <b>this morning</b>, headed north. My guests said they saw them also before <b>7 AM</b> this morning.
<br/>Helen King
<br/>Highland Inn, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> at Andrews Point/Smallpox Bay heading North at <b>2:30 PM</b>. Ruffles definitely stands out, even from a distance. About 13 members of J-Pod, no sign of the other 9, which are probably hanging back some. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
The one thing <b>J's</b> are doing is spreading over a few miles of area and coming back together almost like a living thing.
That is, expanding and contracting.
I left them entering Andrews Bay going North just before <b>1600</b> this afternoon.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/><br/>
<b>May 25, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
One <b>gray</b> (Trim Tail) at Spee-Bi-Dah, east side of Port Susan, feeding <b>7:10 am to 7:40 am</b>.
<br/>Malcolm &amp; Tarry Lindquist
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Jpod this am and pm</b> west side of San Juan Is, with a report of a <b>humpback</b> this am west of Race Rocks but no contact.
A <b>minke</b> with J's just S. W. of Hein Bank this afternoon with Jpod.
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG

<br/><br/>
<b>May 24, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
About <b>7:30 PM</b> 2 <b>gray</b> whales came by Langley, feeding close to
shore. One definitely was a mature adult, I'm not sure if the
second one was smaller or not.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Beauty of a day and whales very slowly moving up the West Side of San Juan Island. I spotted <b>J-Pod</b> around <b>10 AM</b> near Mitchell Point/Low Island, they were still hanging around, tightly grouped, and slowly moving North.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:15pm</b>... Looks like a pair of <b>grays</b> sailing by First St in Langley, headed East.  They're making haste.
<br/>Sharen Heath
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>grays</b> east of Langley feeding on the shrimp beds close to shore at <b>7:35 PM.</b> Lolligagging their way to Sandy Point (south).
<br/>Mark Anderson
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
I just came in from watching a couple of <b>grays</b> go by Cama Beach heading North. One of my camp hosts heard it blowing and came and informed me around <b>6:30 am</b>. I for sure saw two grays with a possibility of a third smaller one about the size of a calf.
<br/>Melanie
<br/>Cama Beach State Park, Camano Island
<br/><br/>
<b>May 23, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
...<b>J-Pod</b> near Cattle Pass (S. San Juan Island). Most of J-Pod was very spread out, but we were able to see Ruffles, Mike, Oreo, Doublestuff, Cookie (Oreo's newly named youngster) and others.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
While on the Clinton ferry this morning (<b>11:05am</b>) we saw a couple of heart shaped blows as we were leaving Clinton. Possibly two <b>grays</b> headed north towards Possession Point/Clinton area. Too far away for confident ID. 
<br/>Sandy Dubpernell
<br/>Coupeville
<br/>*<br/>
Our second visit from the lone <b>Gray</b> today, this time on the Camano side of Saratoga Passage off Mabana. About <b>5:30 PM</b>, noticed the neighbors looking out over the bank and pointing so went out to join in watching the lone gray make his way north/west fairly close to shore, then stop to feed at Mabana.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called at <b>9:30 am</b> to report one <b>gray</b> whale off Elger Bay, Camano Island. Cascadia Research was on board &amp; ID'd the whale as one of the new ones identified earlier this season - number "New A".
<br/>*<br/>
Hi Susan-  Lone <b>Gray</b> spouting between Bell's Beach and East Point on Whidbey side of Saratoga Passage this morning at <b>9:30 AM</b>. 
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>from Camano
<br/><br/>
<b>May 22, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
My partner and I saw three to five whales (porpoises?) from the little mini park on First Street in Langley. We were lunching and could only make out the individual breathing sprays coming from a ways off toward Camano. They were headed south by southwest toward Clinton. Couldn't tell what sort of whale, as we were to far away. However, we could see quite a bit of blowing and activity in the water.
<br/>Heather Newman-Gardner
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
I noticed the Mosquito Fleet sitting in between Bells Beach and Camano watching one lone <b>gray</b>. Its about <b>9:35 AM</b> and looks like its heading southward.
<br/>Bob Armbruster
<br/>Langley
<br/><br/>
<b>May 21, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
Between <b>18:00 and 18:30</b>, I observed a large (40-50 ft.) <b>fin whale</b> [<i>probably a humpback - see May 17 report</i>] (identified by the size, distinctive dorsal fin and white markings on the undersides of the flukes) at approximately 47 deg. 20 min. N and 123 deg. 32.5 min. W. This is about halfway between Dalco Pt. On Vashon Island and the Point Defiance (Tacoma) ferry dock. It was tail splashing about twice a minute. No boats were present. As a tow with two barges approached, the whale stopped surface activity. Observations were made with a 60X telescope from the east side of Colvos Passage at an elevation of 240 feet. No photographs were possible due to the distance.
<br/>Dave Stevens
<br/>Gig Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
Fabulous first day back on San Juan Island after too many months away!  
In the afternoon, followed <b>J-pod</b> north from Eagle Point. Left the orcas at Lime Kiln about <b>3:45 pm</b> heading north, with J-1 and J-2 leading.  
Several small calves outperformed their elders in the multiple breaching category.
<br/>As I neared Lime Kiln, orca vocalizations blared loudly and clearly over the radio (FM 89.1). Detoured again. At around <b>7:20 pm</b> the J-pod trailers were going south off Hannah Heights.
<br/>San Juan Island is great!
<br/>Sharon Grace
<br/>*<br/>
Once again I spy whales (W. side San Juan Island) from the house as I talk with Ken Balcomb on the phone (OK, he spotted them first). Slowly moving North towards Henry Island.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
Rick from Mosquito Fleet called to report 2 <b>gray whales</b> 1/2 mile off Mabana, w. Camano Island, heading toward the Whidbey side at <b>9:30 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2 grays</b> at <b>9:30am</b> in Saratoga Passage traveling S. followed by a tour boat keeping a reasonable distance. They were off of Langley still going S. at <b>9:30</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan called to say he saw a <b>humpback</b> breach off Cape Johnson, Olympic National Park on Thursday while hiking in the area.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>JPod</b> passing by the house (W. San Juan Island) again during the sunset hour.....very spread out, heading slowly North.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
Ron Bates called in, at <b>9:16 p</b>m, with <b>J pod</b> heading up Swanson Channel, mid-N. Pender Island, south of Mouat Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
From Camano at <b>8:30 PM</b>. A neighbor called to alert us that a lone <b>gray</b> whale was passing below our bluff. The tide was in and he was in the shallows quite close to shore, traveling fairly rapidly north, until it reached its' favorite feeding area just south of Mabana where it stopped to feed.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>from Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Just got back from a nice visit with <b>J-pod</b> near Colville Island, south end of Lopez island. Left them around <b>3:00 pm</b> crossing Cattle Pass heading west.

The animal reported as a fin whale (see May 21 report) in Puget Sound is more likely a humpback whale. Todd Chander and Erin Falcone of Cascadia Research along with two volunteers did a survey of this region in response to reports of a gray whale. They instead found a juvenile humpback whale off the south end of Vashon Island who was very active and doing peduncle slaps (sideways slaps of the tail). This behavior and location is similar to the recent sighting reported which makes me think it is the same humpback whale.

From an email from Marilyn Joyce of Canada's DFO today: "We have confirmation that the sighting of <b>killer whales</b> off Tofino, B.C. on Monday May 17th at <b>1300</b> hrs was indeed members of <b>K and L pods</b>. There have been no subsequent sightings and their last known direction was SW off Long Beach, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
<br/>*<br/>
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research reported a pod of <b>15 Transients</b> off Discovery Island in the evening. Could be some of these whales that are visiting Dyes Inlet - John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research was out to get photos in Dyes Inlet yesterday, so hopefully we'll have some ID's of this pod soon.

Great day for the whales at Saratoga Passage just south of Polnell Pt. I was very excited two see two young <b>Orcas</b>, one of them still had a pink tint to its white markings.

Same <b>Transients</b>, <b>12:30 to 3:30 pm</b> Polnell Point. We were treated to a view of the two or three adults and two or three babies, one of which was peach or pink still! It was my best sighting ever! I got to see my first spy hop, first tail flukes, both adults and baby ones, a fin wave, a few breaches, and lots of enjoyable views of white eye patches and tummies. The water was glassy, the air was silent and calm, we drifted silently around the edge of the vicinity with our sails up and heard the whales breathe and splash and swoosh.

<br/>*<br/>
We watched the <b>Transients</b> from the Coupeville Wharf from <b>6:30 - 7:15 pm</b>, from the NW side of Penn Cove to the entrance of the cove. As they reached the entrance there was some lunging, spy-hopping, and whales going in every direction, so it's likely they made a kill there. They then kept heading out toward Polnell Pt until they were out of sight.

Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called to report one <b>gray</b> whale a mile south of Hat Island at <b>6:15 pm</b>.

We also observed the <b>Orca</b> pod off Lovejoy Point inside of Penn Cove. I first saw what I thought was a lone <b>'Minki' whale</b> traveling very fast on the surface into Penn Cove at about <b>1630</b> hr. About 300-400 yards behind was a pod of Orcas (4-6) that appeared to be trailing the first whale.  As of <b>1730</b> hr the whales were still inside Penn Cove in choppy water well off the Coupeville wharf. They came into Penn Cove at 1630 hr and left at 1930hr.  A lot of spy hopping, fin waving group tailing. Mostly along the tide/current line just off the shore of Love Joy Point about 200 yds from the beach. They left along the same route/area they came into the cove. They would spend time grouped up and in the same spot with a lot of activity then move off underwater. Although we took some video it is doubtfull any identifcation could be made. They entered the cove with the flood tide and left around slack.

<br/>*<br/>Jeff Hogan called to report <b>J pod</b> off the west side of San Juan Island (at the County Park) at <b>9:30 am</b>, spread out and heading north, at <b>10:30</b> am they turned and headed south, grouped up to South Beach, then back up north again at <b>4:30 pm</b>. All of J pod were present and accounted for.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> was very spread out around Eagle Point/American Camp out to Salmon Bank. As we were leaving, Oreo (J-22), her offspring Doublestuff, and new baby J-39 came right by the boat. Fabulous!

Saturday morning one of my passengers saw a single <b>transient</b> while coming to Victoria from Port Angeles on the Coho. He thought it was west bound.  After seeing J1 he claimed it was definately a male. Maybe T61 is still lurking around out there or perhaps T14?

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod</b> spent the day on the west and south side of San Juan Island. They were going north and at <b>6:00 PM</b>  turned south again.

Got out today to say hello to J-pod and went south through San Juan Channel. Of course, the final treat was seeing J-pod off of Eagle Pt.
