After traveling grouped up in resting mode for several hours, <b>K pod</b> woke up off <b>Alki Point</b>; here is <b>K33 Tika</b> in all his acrobatic beauty. -Photo by Kersti Muul, Nov 30, 2018 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Fri Nov 30 - <b>K pod - Puget Sound</b> -<b> 16:30 - whales</b> spread out east of channel, moving north of Golden Gardens now.
<br/><b>15:40 - 2-3 orcas</b> northbound, west of midchannel. Viewing from Valley Road Bluff on <b>Bainbridge</b>. -Sue Larkin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:32 - (orcas)</b> visible from <b>Fay Bainbridge</b>. Mid channel-ish, well to the south, perhaps off Yeomalt. -James Rufo Hill

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~15:25 - </b>Saw <b>orcas from the Bainbridge ferry</b>. Heading north and west toward Seattle. Looked like one or maybe two, moving fast. No breaching. -Heather Paar

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:00 -</b> Jeff Hogan took photos from the Alki lighthouse and only found members of <b>K pod</b>, including members of all the matrilines and <b>K25</b>, a 27-year old male who was reported not looking too good a few months ago. They were traveling at a good clip.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:15- 14:45 -</b> I arrived to the south side of <b>Alki Point</b> at 13:15 where soon after I spotted the group of illuminated blows rising to the south off <b>Lincoln Park</b>. I then moved south and relocated to Lowman Beach were I watched this lovely tight group of <b>Ks</b> moving north on the east side of the channel at steady pace. K pod holds quite a presence with so many adult &amp; sub adult male dorsals rising above the surface.  I then headed north to the south end of Emma Schmitz along Beach Drive around 13:45 and watched with many others for ~ 15 minutes as Ks continued north still grouped in resting heading towards Alki Point.
<br/>Onward I traveled to south side of Alki (which was lined with dozens more humans) where I parked myself on the most westerly end of Constellation Park and watched Ks approach in choppy seas under moody skies. Ks reached <b>Alki Point about 14:20</b>, now loosely spread, then just as they would have disappeared around the point breach after breach by at least 4 individuals interspersed with some forward lunges, tail throws, pec slaps etc; Ks woke up it the most glorious and stunning visible way I'd witnessed. Bulls flanking and flying through the air all around the dwarfed skiff cradling researchers Mark and Maya Sears who were braving rough seas and cold temp.  After Ks calmed their orca selves down, I moved to the north side of Alki to catch one last glimpse before heading home. At 14:38 they were north of the Point still continuing northbound, with some foraging and some more breaching along the way on the east side of channel along outer edge of Elliot Bay. We all paused, happily stunned at what had just unfolded before our brighter &amp; now bigger little eyes. How completely heartwarming to see the whales and the faces of all the others, to share in that moment watching K pod wake up off that West Seattle point in Puget Sound. I listened to one woman who shared she was driving and pulled over then stood with another guy who shared it was his first time ever seeing orcas, imagine! One of the most memorable and deluxe encounters with these gigantic lovely beings. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I never get to see breaches...Today I got to see about 20 in a row...With my friends, and my Heart to boot. All of <b>Kpod present. K21. K25 and K33 </b>were grouped up at one point and all around the boat. Breach after breach....K33 in photo Taken from shore at Constellation Beach, Alki. Whales were about mid-channel NB towards Elliot Bay. Around 2:35 they started a breaching and tail slapping show. -Kersti Muul
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Hi folks, What an amazing afternoon with our beautiful residents! A breachfest indeed-wonderful to see a double breach followed almost immediately by a third! Here are a few photos for you; I'm sure others will have wonderful photos to share as well. Thanks for all your good work,<b> K35 Sonata</b>, research boat, &amp; <b>K33 Tika.</b> -

<b>14:27 (orcas)</b> about a hundred yards off Alki Point. Ten or more breaches! I've seen these guys dozens of times. Never witnessed anything even close to that.
<br/><b>14:19 - (orcas)</b> passing Constellation Park maybe 400 yards offshore nearly to <b>Alki Point</b>. -Jason Lee Bell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:41 - (orcas)</b> Still viewing from <b>Lincoln Park</b>, they definitely look awake and are moving at a pretty good clip. Still bunched up and traveling north or northwest near mid channel or just east of it.
<br/><b>13:33 - (orcas)</b> Viewing from Coleman Pool at <b>Lincoln Park</b> West Seattle. Line of sight to south end of Blake Island, angling toward mid channel, but currently still east of. -Jason Lee Bell

<b>11:22 - (orcas)</b> they are slightly north of the <b>Marine View Park (Normandy Park)</b>. Still trending north on the eastern side but moving very slowly. They are almost out of my sight
<br/><b>11:05 - (orcas)</b> they are moving very very slowly and are all bunched up which makes me believe that perhaps they are resting? I think that there are between six and eight, it's hard to tell. And I think I've seen two larger dorsal fins.
<br/><b>10:54 -</b> I am watching the orca from 218th St. in <b>Normandy Park</b>. Looking straight out from the dead end of the street I can see the orca mid channel, but closer to the Eastside. They are moving slowly north. They are between 218 St. and the single radio tower on <b>Vashon</b>. My location is just slightly North of the Des Moines's fishing pier. -Tanya Esparza

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:31 - (orcas) Pt Robinson </b>watchers here they come ... so close to this side in a big pack.
<br/><b>10:23 - (orcas)</b> Just south of<b> Pt Robinson</b> on the Vashon side. -Janna Ignatow

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:59 -</b> I can see spouts off the south end of Vashon, south of<b> Point Robinson</b>, but they'll be there soon...heading north. But it is too far away for me to see any detail (Des Moines). -Julie Martin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:21 - (orcas) At least six off Browns Point (Tacoma)</b> right now, heading north. -Chuck Drake

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:43 - (orcas) </b>I think 3, headed deep into <b>Commencement Bay</b>, just passed Les Davis pier heading east.
<br/><b>8:13 - 2 Orcas in Commencement Bay</b>, a few hundred yards east of Vashon ferry lane. No obvious direction of travel. -Glenn Myles

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Nov 30 - Juan de Fuca - <b>Transients - North east of Dungeness Light</b> - I left Victoria harbour at 1130 to go look for the killer whales I had seen come in from the west off of Sheringham Point the evening before (CA's/U's along with T046B's)...Full encounter report with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 104.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Fri Nov 30 - Seeing what appear to be a group of <b>3-4 orcas in Bellingham Bay</b> at the edge of the flow line from the Nooksack River. They are closer to the Lummi Reservation side of the bay. Anyone else spotting them there? -Kristine Elliot 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - <b>14:00 - (orcas)</b> They really weren't moving with any intention. Last I saw them they could have gone toward<b> Tolmie, Nisqually or the other side of Anderson Island</b>. If you are watching for them be patient. They dip just below the surface, then up and breathe, back down in the same spot.
<b><br/>13:00 - (orcas) between Devil's Head and Zittles Marina</b>. Looks to be an adult with a calf. Can't confirm if there are 2 young ones. I see the adult rise followed by a small fin then 2 exhales but can only spot one calf's fin. Moving very slowly. -Joan Ahre

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>09:00 -</b> Shawn Bashor reports seeing <b>orcas heading north up the Case Inlet</b> off the south end of Key Peninsula, north end Nisqually Reach. He reports at least 1 adult and 1 juvenile.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Thu Nov 29 - Great to sea so many <b>Transient Killer Whales today around Sooke, Matriarch T46B...her daughter T46B1 alongside a new calf. T46Bs 2nd offpspring T46B2, U83, U84, and CA173</b> in the Juan De Fuca Strait feeding on sea lions and chasing down the many harbour porpoise in the area. Not sure yet of Id's but looked like a return of CA's and some of our regulars that were well spread out in hunting groups 12+! -Paul Pudwell

Tue Nov 27 - <b>14:30 pm:</b> Just saw <b>three orcas headed west between mid south Fox Island and McNeil!</b> Looks like they were feeding for awhile. Spectacular!! (from mid south Fox Island.) -Charlene Welty

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:46 -</b> They are between <b>McNeil and Fox </b>and might be headed North again towards <b>Fox Island</b> Pier, not sure. I can see them via binoculars from Day Island.
<br/><b>~13:20 -</b> I saw them through binoculars from <b>Day Island</b> at about 1:20 and they were near the Fox Island buoy South of the Pier. Can't see them now. Maybe they are on the South side of Fox? -Karen Caldwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:40 - </b>Pod of <b>Orcas</b> heading south spotted at south end of <b>Fox Island</b> -Jennie Martin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:30 - Orcas </b>just south of the <b>Narrows Bridge</b>. From the Gig Harbor side they look closer to the Tacoma side. They were jumping around in one spot - it started pouring rain so I didn't see where they went after. -Kristen Joelle

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:30 - (orcas)</b> They are mid channel just North of the bridge now. Headed North...watched a little one tail slap about 7 times!
<br/><b>12:10 -</b> (orcas) Still feeding close to shore South of the bridge, West side of the channel, trending slowly North
<br/><b>11:57 -</b> Orcas headed North along West side of channel towards the Narrows. Slowly, feeding and changing direction. Facebook Video

GRAY WHALES - Tue Nov 27 - North Puget Sound - <b>15:00-15:45</b> - Watched who turned out to be<b> 2 whales</b> (Marilyn spotted the 2nd blow well away from the inshore whale) who by behavior and lack of dorsal, look to be grays, off<b> north end Jetty Island</b> spread few hundred yards apart; one whale inside wooden channel marker closer to Jetty Island, directly <b>south of Priest Point, Tuallip</b>; 2nd whale just south of channel marker further offshore. Both foraging around In the muddy plumes of the Snohomish Delta while pod of harbor porpoise cruises south nearby. I would say grays; with confidence the inshore whale and probably both, but too  distant to confirm 100% or for any IDs or photos.  Inshore whale typical gray feeding behavior with a lot of birds swooping in. No dorsal present on either and no dives/flukes. Still in the same general areas when we left around 15:45. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:00 - </b>Spotted a whale blow off<b> Jetty Park</b> near the channel marker. Viewed from Legion Park, Everett. -Marilyn Armbruster

South Central Puget Sound - <b>10:50 - </b>Maia at WS Ferries relayed a report of a <b>humpback in Colvos Passage</b>. No further info or direction of travel.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sun Nov 25 - North Puget Sound - 10:47 - Earlier I was confident that there were two based on the distance between the blows. Currently my view of their location is blocked by trees and I am only seeing one. It has moved west. I did see a fin and back earlier.
<br/><b>09:55 -</b> We are seeing two whales just west of <b>Priest Point (Tulalip area)</b>. They appear to be <b>grey whales</b>. Viewing from the Harbor View Park area in Everett. -Greg Heiss

Sat Nov 24 - South Puget Sound - What a thrill. <b>Gray whale CRC-2234 surfaces off Cooper Point, Olympia.</b> Fog so thick all I could do was hear sea lion barking and then....just like that... the HUGE exhalation of <b>the gray whale</b>. It was close to the tip of Cooper Point, Eld Inlet side. The fog lifted just enough to allow me to see one super clear surfacing series. Then it traveled back and forth along this side of the spit. Here are a handful of images I could get while shooting in super thick fog. I was even able to capture a couple of its friends. At times I couldn't see...but I could hear! So. Very. Grateful. -Kim Merriman

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - <b>SJI Westside Orca </b>Sighting 11-22-18 at <b>3:23pm</b>. From the shore I was watching the waves zoom past to the NW when I was startled and thrilled to see orcas fins cut above the waves. I saw 4 for sure (maybe 5) orcas zoom past me traveling to the SS/E towards and past Hannah Heights. They were moving fast and only surfaced briefly 5 times. There was one large male out ahead and a very tight group of three (possibly 4) following. This group included one very tiny dorsal fin. All the best, little one. May your family hunt with fortune. My camera was not at the ready but I managed one quick photo of the male,<b> T49A1 Haro Strait</b> off San Juan Island.. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

UNIDENTIFIED CETACEAN - Thu Nov 22 - <b>Hood Canal -</b> I'm a Midwesterner new to observing marine life, so I'm not sure if it was an orca I just saw at <b>Scenic Beach State Park in Seabeck</b>. Whatever it was had a black fin and seemed to be alone. My first sighting! It was more curved, like the middle or top left (in reference to photos provide indicating most like Lags &amp; bottlenose dorsal) and seemed fairly small, but I had nothing to compare it to, so who knows. I didn't get to see any of the body. Birds kept attacking it every time the dorsal fin came out of the water so I think it kept going back under pretty quick to avoid them. -Melissa Mason

Wed Nov 21 - <b>15:42 - </b>I just saw what appears to be either <b>a gray or humpback whale </b>just south of the <b>Mukilteo Ferry lane</b>... it is a bit difficult to determine what direction it is headed but for now seems to be feeding in the area! Sorry there aren't pictures he/she was a bit far off a ways. I did see very briefly a very low - not too pointed dorsal fin- it very much resembled that of the grays we saw in the spring. But it was too far away to see any distinct markings unfortunately. -Danica Gonsalves

COASTAL KILLER WHALES - Sun Nov 18 - <b>CA Coast - 7:30-7:45 am</b> - Jay Scribner was surfing in Humboldt Bay in <b>Eureka CA</b> off the north jetty when two orcas surfaced about 150 yards behind him.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sun Nov 18 - <b>OR Coast</b> - Hi there, We spotted a pod of orcas off <b>North Pointe, north of Depoe Bay OR at 4pm to almost 4:30 pm.</b> We are staying in a condo there, on the  second story, so we are about 35 to 40 ft  above the water. The weather was unusually sunny and warm, and the swell was incredibly calm. I spotted them several hundred yards off the coastline. The sun was just right that their dorsal fins were very distinctive and dark, sillouetted against the lighter grey-blue water. There were at least five adults, one definitely a male. There were two that seemed to be mother and calf, they were surfacing in tandem. I was watching through binoculars so could not see what they we're hunting, but they definitely were circling, lunging, and jumped out of the water two times, and the birds were circling and darting down to the water's surface. They did this for 10 to 15 minutes, then continued to circle much more slowly as the birds began to settle on the water. The pod then made their way South past the outer bouy that is at the edge of the bay. Because they were so far out, their markings we're almost impossible to see. they barely had any sort of markings round their eyes, and we could not see the white of their underbelly until one jumped completely out of the water. Three or four times, just before they started heading south, one or another would rise out of the water nose first, spyhopping, and I could see the white of their throats. I hope this is the sort of information you are looking for. -Holly Marley

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:45 -</b> Langley Whale Center Just got a call from a guy in <b>Depoe Bay, OR</b> (didn't get his name-sorry) to report sighting of a group of <b>transients</b> just now. He said there were <b>5-7 orcas</b>, including a "very large" male and said they looked like they had just made a kill. Orcas were about 1/4 mile offshore. He said there was also a gray whale about 200 yards offshore. Wish I had gotten his name-if he sees this, maybe he could leave a name in comments. -Sharon Anne Clark

GRAY WHALES - Sun Nov 18 - South Puget Sound - <b>16:30 - </b>I have been watching it again for the past 2 hours. It is sticking close to <b>Cooper Point</b> spit and slightly north and south of it. It ventures into <b>Eld</b> a bit. Then crosses the spit and ventures into <b>Budd</b>. Lots of surface activity - spy hops, tail throws, and pec slaps. It is often followed closely by the sea lions. The whale surfaces, and then so too do they, 3-4 at a time. It's as if they are 'no its heels'. It's wild. I missed the breach a few minutes ago. And the breach just now with Mt. Rainer in the background and the moon rising above that. :( What a gorgeous pink hue to water and sky. -Kim Merriman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~14:10 - Eld Inlet saw the gray whale</b> in front of Flap Jack. It surfaced twice and did one tail throw. It was moving north out of the inlet. -Sharesse Fowler

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:26 - Gray whale (CRC 2234) at Cooper Point</b> spit shallows and immediate area (<b>Budd and Eld inlets</b>) this morning for several hours. Last seen heading north east toward Boston Harbor and Dana Passage. Very active - with surfacing series, spy hops, and tail throws. Very robust blows, too. Those are rafting sea lions behind it. They have all been hanging out in the same area. Sights and sounds on Sunday morning deep in the southern end of Puget Sound. Gray whale 2234's early morning visit to Cooper Point (Budd/Eld inlets) while it surfaced, spy hopped, threw its tail - all the while traveling back and forth along the sand spit itself. It was joined by a whole lot of sea lions. Everyone exhaling at the same time. Then some barking. Synchronicity on full display. Such grace. -Kim Merriman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:15 - </b>still seeing orcas spread out across the Possession Triangle (Point No Point/Edmonds/S Whidbey - as we call it -alb) looking further away so must be moving south, and judging by the crowd on the spit at Point No Point, they are getting some good views from there! What a beautiful day to watch Southern Resident orcas in Puget Sound, and even more beautiful to see them milling and foraging, hopefully finding lots of salmon.
<br/><b>14:30  - Orcas</b> are spread out north and south of a large sailboat, again, very difficult to determine direction - perhaps they are milling and foraging, but at least some seem to be <b>trending north toward Possession Pt/Sound</b>. There are some behind/west of the tugboat headed south, spread out over toward Scatchet Head/Possession Pt. I think they are milling and foraging, just saw a few breaches - but they seem to be moving east (toward the mainland) rather than west (toward Admiralty) at the moment, but not sure if their trend is north (into <b>Possession Sound</b>) or south (back into Puget Sound) from this distance. It is very difficult to see them from anywhere when they get lost in the Possession Triangle!
<br/><b>14:10 - </b>looks like orcas  are very spread out, heading N/NE toward <b>either the south end of Whidbey Island and/or into Possession Sound?</b> Again, due to distance very difficult to tell how far east they are - but at this point closer to the Whidbey side and headed toward S. Whidbey.
<br/><b>14:05 -</b> FINALLY seeing some blows (viewing from south of Bush Pt), hard to tell with the distance and fuzzy visibility, but it looks like they may be <b>off Double Bluff</b>, about 1/3 of the way toward Point No Point?

Here are the photos from <b>Dash Point Park </b>viewpoint as the SRKWs made their way north past Gold Beach on Vashon (11/15, <b>2:30-4:10pm</b>). Unfortunately I was at the far reach of my 600mm &amp; 840mm lenses, but it was AMAZING to see so many whales - probably 20 foraging in small groups of 3-4. <b>J27 Blackberry, J47 Notch</b>. We saw lots of headstands, tail lobs, spyhops, rolls and breaches. The coolest shots are the full-body breach that happened right next to the research boat at 4pm and the sea snake that some fella brought to the party ...With salmon in short supply and the SRKWs visits so much less predictable, this dry, sunny, salmon-filled moment in time feels like a blessing for all of us...Belen Bilgic Schneider

I arrived at the Tacoma waterfront (between <b>Pt Defiance ferry dock and Anthony's</b>) shortly after 12 Noon to meet Gayle S. Soon after Gayle and I (and our new friend Kelly W) began seeing blows to the north spread across the channel <b>between Maury Island and Dash Point</b>. The pods continued steady progression as if heading towards Dalco Pass when at ~ 12:20 quite a few turned towards <b>Commencement Bay.</b> I imagine some communication took place because after they did suddenly most everyone made an abrupt left and headed towards Commencement, some moving quickly and soon after breaches and  tail lobs as they headed in that direction. A few kept out mid channel and began making a lot of directional changes. Gayle and I moved to higher ground to confirm if they were continuing into the bay...we saw a group of at least 4-6 close inshore off <b>Point Ruston</b> now heading back westbound. Thinking we might see a close pass we hurried it back to our spot by the ferry dock, but that group flipped and was now heading east again. We waited them out several minutes only to see that whales streaming eastbound towards Commencement. The three of us decided to head over to Ruston Way and find a spot which proved to be the excellent decision. Over the next 90+ minutes we watched Js/L87 and Ks spread out all over with a large percentage streaming their way right on into <b>Commencement Bay </b>in 1s-4s! <b>Matriarch K14 Lea (born 1977), J40 Suttles (born 2004), J41 Eclipse (born 2005)By 13:20</b> the leaders were deep into the bay, others still streaming in, while others stayed behind keeping to the outer edges still foraging with some surface activity. All the while NOAA collected samples. The whales who traveled into the bay made a northerly u-turn on their way out more mid channel, with some eventually moving closer to the Brown's Point side. It took some time to confirm which way they were going to go, but became clear they were heading back north via the main channel between east side of Vashon and the mainland. We left Ruston Way about 14:10 as the pods continued their travels north spread out across the channel between Maury Island and Brown's &amp; Dash Points. We were off to find the humpback...Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>16:50 -</b> Thinking <b>Vivaldi</b> was feeding/staying in the area under <b>Dalco Viewpoint</b>, Gayle, Kelly, and I moved up there and just as we stepped out of the car we heard loud exhalation out of sight behind the trees as if heading toward Owen Beach. We waited several minutes in hope s/he would circle back, but s/he did not. With no daylight left we headed back down to Owen Beach for perhaps a moonlight encounter, but we never laid eyes or ears on Vivaldi after stepping out of the car at Dalco Viewpoint at ~16:50.

Hi there! There appears to be <b>one member of the Southern Residents</b> hanging out in <b>Paradise Cove</b> (Colvos Passage). We've had a ton of fishermen out here over the last two weeks, so I Imagine it's for the salmon. I believe I saw this member last week as well, do not appear to be any others with it. Definitely looks too big to be a dolphin, the dorsel fin is extremely tall, and it did come out of the water - although it was too far too identify markings. The channel is quite deep, but they are in an area that does get shallow quickly. They stayed in the cove for about 30 minutes, between 8:15a to 8:45. Hope this is helpful! -Kallie Sandstrom

Hello Alisa, Today at approximately<b> 2:30 pm</b> I saw <b>at least 4 Orca, 2 males, 2 females in Puget Sound, off Maury Island south of Pt. Robinson</b>. They were between the shipping lanes and the Island. There was a small open boat - orange - that seemed to be tracking them and at one point a female came up very near the boat. It almost looked like it may have been a research boat. It was orange, about 20+ feet, open/skiff. Maybe inflatable. There were 2 people in the boat.
<br/>Whales were headed south, though circled some as I believe they were fishing. My home is on the opposite shore, at Lakota Beach just north of Dumas Bay 47 longitude, 122 latitude. I watched them through binoculars for about a half hour as they moved south. The boat was still with them. We have seen lots of salmon in the area in the past few days. Sealions have been feeding in this area. I sure hope these are residents getting a good meal. They could use a break.
<br/>Thanks for your work keeping track of all this. As a child we spent summers and weekends at Bush Point and the pods were huge in the 60's. We would see them every summer and had no thought that it would ever end. Now I fear for them. -Barbara Nuss 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw several <b>orcas off Vashon</b> today, was told there was 2 pods coming from the north. A lot of activity! One of the people that was looking with us from Owens beach side had counted 20. -Photo by Cherie St.Ours, Nov 13, 2018

Met up with Gayle at <b>Point Robinson</b> where we planted our feet out on the beach about 12:45. Soon after I picked up my binoculars set my eyes to the north and was pleased to see multiple blows heading our way. Over the next 30 minutes or so we patiently waited and watched as the lead orcas moved closer in view to those of us gathering on shore. The first leaders arrive around <b>13:30</b> passing offshore mid channel at a good clip; two duos porpoising past in tandem mid channel. Over the next 45 minutes we, along with an ever growing crowd of happy humans, watched <b>Js, L87 and Ks</b> stream by in 1-4s spread wide, across the channel east to west and north to south, grouped as families and blended members of both pods. With whales everywhere, it was a pleasurable predicament trying to decide who to watch, where to lay our eyes.
<br/><b>J51 Nova</b> was one of the early whales to pass in close. This young guy swam past close in-shore with mom and others near. <b>J40</b> went by and soon after <b>J46 Star</b> passed, made a u-turn where she proceeded to swim directly towards us. Her movement  slow and with intention. She then shifted to a parallel tract, continued northbound a short distance close to shore then flipped again to continue southbound with the rest of her pod-mates.
<br/><b>J27</b> was another who came by super close to shore, his presence big and beautiful.<b> J49 and mom J37</b> came by togehter. <b>K26</b> was another who passed close in with L87 not far behind a little more offshore. <b>K42 </b>surfaced nearby next to <b>J45</b> and another unidentified member. <b>J47</b> came in close, blowing nice bubbles as he surfaced. Was lovely to see <b>K21</b>, such a regal fellow. Next up the <b>K13s</b>, again this group close to shore porpoising just before the point creating waves which tumbled along the shore moments later. <b>K20</b> Spock with her offspring passed by, with elder big boy <b>K25</b> further offshore. The <b>J17s</b> came along near us affording a sweet look at <b>J17 Princess Angeline and little J53 Kiki</b>. I haven't had a chance to go through all photos to see who all was where, but the last family to pass was the <b>J16s</b> who approached very close to shore. This family of four went down just before the point and surfaced just beyond, bypassing us all completely on this longish dive. A heartfelt moment to spend a few minutes with this family in particular who has lost so much. Photos taken from shore at Point Robinson -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>11:45-12:25 -</b> Watched from <b>Dilworth on Vashon </b>, and saw many whales pass moving steadily south. When I left there was still a large male near the Vashon shore, just south of the Dilworth point, and a few stragglers behind him. Looks like a research vessel is near the tail end of group, mid channel. I think there are closer to 20, or more. Hard to tell as they are so spread out. -Holly Boaz

Tue Nov 13 - On November 13, 2018 we observed<b> a pod travelling south in Rosario Strait</b> about 200 yards or so from our shoreline.  We are between <b>Sea Acres and Doe Bay resort and look out on the Pea Pod rocks</b>. The group consisted of a male with a tall dorsal fin and followed by a tightly clustered group (4-6) about 200 yards behind the male orca. They were travelling and moved right along. We were not able to ID or guess genders or ages in the group. We are thrilled to hear the news on TV tonight of the grants/monies heading to saving the SRKW. We so appreciate your work!! -Keith and Ann Jones

Tue Nov 13 - South Puget Sound - There is a <b>gray at Cooper Point spit</b>. It did a whole bunch of spy hopping. It has been there for hours, going back and forth slightly north and then turns and goes south. Lots of surfacing series and spy hopping - as if trying to feed at the spit itself. This whale is joined by about 30 sea lions. -Kim Merriman

Definitely <b>residents tonight at Point No Point</b>. It got dark so some photos are grainy. They were quite spread out with it taking about an hour for all to pass.

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -<b> 16:30 -</b> most if not all the pod rounded Whidbey mostly grouped and look to be heading west directly <b>towards Kitsap</b>. Not up Admiralty. A lot of breaching going on, some pec slaps, lazy rolls, etc.
<br/><b>16:05 -</b> Many of us on the shores watched as they came from the north, first group mid channel. Others following with one group porposing at one point, then on a dive in front of us surfacing a little spread apart. Currently looks like all have passed <b>Possession Park</b>, spread across the channel and mile or so distance between leaders and trailers. Some foraging, breaches, forward lunges etc. while moving southbound toward Puget Sound proper. Large number hugging Whidbey others mid channel as we lose sight. -Alisa Lemire brooks, ON

Nov 9 - Haro Strait - <b>~17:00 -</b> My hubby noticed three kayaks paused at <b>Eagle Cove</b>, SJI at sunset today and then shouted...."and the whales are here too"! I was thrilled by the behaviors I witnessed! My only regret is that I couldn't ID them as the light was so dim and they were extremely active. There were 8-12 individuals, at least 3 large males, females, a juvenile, and a tiny wee one. (I couldn't tell if it had an orange tinge as the lighting was tricky) They remained on the south side of Eagle Point and were foraging back and forth, over and over again, and exhibiting extreme above-water behavior. At least 20+ breaches/bellyflops, several spyhops, and excessive pec slaps and tail lobbing. It sounded like the 4th of July out there! They stayed very close together, almost clustered, tactile-like behavior. And then back to foraging behavior, back and forth!  After pitch darkness, I could still hear their exhales and extensive above-water behavior. Last I could hear them, it sounded like they were headed slightly south/southwest, perhaps towards Salmon Bank. -Lodie Giblert Budwill 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Had a great encounter this evening with a group of orcas between<b> False Bay and South Beach</b>. The foraging behavior was very Res. Seemed to be be having success. Lots of surface behaviors. More breach's than I could count. Tails slaps, cart wheeling and crazy amount of peck slaps from the large male in the group. We were paddling and they we enjoyed them for some length of time till sunset and dark. They seemed to be moving off shore to the west slowly. Not a single boat anywhere in sight this evening. -Jason Gunter

Fri Nov 9 - North Puget Sound - (<i><b>J pod/L87 </b>were 8+ miles ahead, is possible a split off group of Rs or a small pod of Bigg's - alb</i>) 
<br/><b>16:30 - 3 orca </b>milling <b>south of Hat Island</b> and may be headed South towards the ferry lanes. I was on the Everett side near the Port, they were probably 2km away. They seemed bigger and darker than harbor porpoise and could see a white saddle patch- not well enough for an indiv ID but didn't seem like a Dalls. It looked like they did a loop from Edgewater Park, NW through Possession Sound, up near Hat Island, and left again South. -Jessica Blanchette

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:40 -</b> Looking from<b> Polnell Shores to Camano</b>. Photos pulled from video. Poor quality. (looks to be between Race Lagoon and Rockaway Beach, Camano) No large males. Didn't come any further north. I saw at least 2 surface at the same time. We watched until we could no longer see them so I assume the headed south. There was breaching, tail slaps and one Spyhopping. Then it just stopped. -Terra Parham

I was watching two separate groups, as they split at <b>south end of Blake Island after exiting Colvos Passage</b>. Saw 3, then counted 4 to 5 observed trending on the west side of Blake Island...lots of activity and splashing as they are completely breaching out of the water, jumping into the sky, seeing tail slapping, spy hopping, they all appear to be super happy. The other group, I counted ~ 6-7 with two large ones as they trailed off to the east side of Blake Island, after stalling at the south tip. Lost all in the <b>sunset at Pomeroy Park in Manchester @5:15</b>. So happy to see the Southern Residents enjoying their day, they appear HAPPY! Makes my heart Happy! -Kathe Bradley

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:50 -</b> looks like <b>Js</b> since looks like I see <b>Onyx</b> out there. Double breach in front of eastbound Ferry out of <b>Kingston</b> bit ago. All continuing northbound spread out. Trailers out from <b>Edmonds</b> north of Ferry. Too soon if going Admiralty or ? -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Wed Nov 7 - Admiralty Inlet - <b>~15:30 -</b> that's Port Townsend's tip in the background. We were coming from PT back to Coup on the ferry, and they looked like they were smack in the middle, heading back out. Facebook VIDEO of pod of 8+ orcas. (<i>Good possibility this is the <b>T46s/46Cs</b> exiting. Wed 7th was the first day with no reports to Orca Network of this family who spent the past week in Puget Sound - alb</i>) -Yvette Williams

Wed Nov 7 - South Puget Sound - <b>14:45 - 15:15 -</b> My kids and I watched the <b>humpback from the Narrows Bridge</b> (looking southeast) from about 2:45-3:15. No boats (or people!) on the bridge. It was amazing. -Amy Natali

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>16:15 -</b> Saw him just south of the <b>Narrows Bridge</b> on the Tacoma side (closely followed by a boat). He was going south quickly. -Kristina Johnston

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Wed Nov 7 - <b>~11:00 - 1 to 3 whales south of Harstine Island Bridge in Pickering Passage</b>. One spy hopped almost half out of water. Up to 3 spouted. Don't think they were Orcas because did not see large dorsal fin and body shape at spy hop was different and saw no white, but do not know what species. -Carl Hauge

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 6</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>16:25 - </b>Found them, East of <b>Point No Point</b>, more towards Whidbey side off channel. Northbound...far enough can only see blows. -Sara Frey

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>16:00 -</b> speedy male is heading towards <b>Point No Point</b>. Three huge breaches along the way.
<br/><b>15 55 -</b> Been watching a large dorsal moving at speed across <b>Possession Sound</b> now heading north on Kitsap side still in a hurry. Spotted a couple of other blows a bit further back also heading north. Visibility decreasing due to light rain. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:40 -</b> this group may have gotten word to head west. Seeing male and others further out and others spread N to S in SB shipping lanes SE of<b> Point No Point to South of Scatchet Head</b>.  
<br/><b>15:20 -</b> at least one matriline of 3-4 (inc. Male) is about 1.5 miles offshore foraging off <b>north Edmonds</b> off Stamm overlook park and just to the south. Nice breach few minutes ago. Long down times. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:05 -</b> Can definitely say now they (at least some) are heading up to <b>PNP/ Admiralty</b>. They are moving very slowly.
<br/><b>14:50 -</b> picked them up again. At this point appear to be heading up toward <b>Admiralty</b>. Still very slow NW bound. -Sara Frey

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:43 -</b> I believe they are back in front of my place now on 27th Ave NW in Shoreline south of<b> Pt Wells</b>, one is close to shore but staying under and going north, it appears there is another surfaced but pretty far out and drifting south at the moment. -Thanks again, Kurt Blomquist

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:30 -</b> last seen with line of sight - <b>Kingston/Everett </b>and off south end of Whidbey. Appeared to be on the Kitsap side of channel and significantly slowed. Have now disappeared x about 10 minutes. -Sara Frey

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:30 -</b> Spotted a couple on the<b> Edmonds side around 2.30</b>. They may have crossed Possession to join other whales seen on the Kitsap side seemingly heading north as seen from Possession Shores. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:00 - </b>at least part of the pod is Edmonds side of green buoy off<b> Scatchet Head, South Whidbey</b>. NE bound towards Cultus Bay (sightline). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:35 -</b> still NB, mid channel - line of sight from <b>Apple Tree Point</b> approaching south tip of Whidbey soon, again, this is just line of sight. Perhaps a bit more west than previously and look to likely be heading to admiralty inlet. I see a lot of blows but mostly just the big boy's dorsals. Its a bit choppy and they are out a ways. -Sara Frey

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:30 -</b> All out from <b>Edmonds</b>, now  north of the ferry dock. Leaders are further offshore. Main resting group has now split up loosely all northbound with male very close to Edmonds just outside the dive park. Too soon to say if they'll continue towards Mukilteo or Admiralty or going to stay around and forage. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:25 - </b>No longer very visible from Marina beach. Heading NNW. PS: this group is awesome!!! Y'all helped my husband and I see orcas for the first time today. -Rachel Worden

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:24 -</b> So incredible. They're heading away from <b>Edmonds</b> now, hopefully everyone on the west side gets a chance to see these beauties today, too. -Photo by Sara Lewis, Nov 6, 2018

<b>12:57 - </b>6-8 spouts 1 mile south of the breakwater at <b>Port of Edmonds</b>. Headed NNW. -Andy Gregory

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:58 -</b> Still in resting lines in two tight groups off<b> Edmonds Dog Park/ Marina Beach</b>... steady northbound. Stunning.
<br/><b>12:50 - </b>can see several including a large male from Kingston. Appear to approaching the <b>Edmonds/Kingston</b> ferry line. Northbound - pretty far east in the shipping channel. Likely closer to the Edmonds side. Looks like the research boat is still trailing. -Sara Frey

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:05 -</b> pod is still grouped now right out from <b>Richmond Beach Saltwater Park</b>, in Shoreline. Steady northbound. Research skiff (looks like Mark Sears) with them.
<br/><b>11:20 -</b> beautiful long resting line....northbound. <b>Carkeek</b> would be good viewing.
<br/><b>11:12 -</b> most have grouped up ( 12-15) and flipped, now northbound off <b>Golden Gardens </b>east of mid channel. Smaller group (2-3) ahead bit NE, and at least one more whale short distance ahead of that group. Steady slow northbound with some active foraging, milling. One male east and south of others.
<br/><b>10:55 - </b>the two groups (slightly spread) are (sightline from Golden Gardens )south of <b>Fay Bainbridge Park</b>, includes 2 males. Another male and at least one female just at north end of Fay B Park (again sightline) all mid channel. And at least one more male trails who is more east in the channel. At least 12-15 orcas...steady southbound. Elevation will be your viewing friend. Sunset park in Ballard would afford views for at least a bit. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:49 - Orcas passing Faye Bainbridge</b>. Heading south bound. East side of channel. -Carol DeRusha

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:15 -</b> Loosely spread <b>at least 10</b>: I see at least 8 in two groups including male in each group, and another male up ahead leading, and another male in rear and to east, mid channel between <b>Golden Gardens</b>, N Seattle and just north of Fay Bainbridge Park. Steady southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>09:30 -</b> I saw what may have been two small orcas near the <b>north end of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park</b>. Saw fins but no tail, the fins looked a lot like an orca as opposed to a dolphin. -Kurt Blomquist

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>By 9:40 -</b> I could see whales spread across entire channel from R<b>ichmond Beach to Jefferson Head</b> and to the south, in groups of 1-4, all steady southbound. At least 4 adult males. Tail lobs.
<br/><b>09:19 -</b> at least dozen spread across channel with some well east of buoy off <b>Richmond Beach</b>. Seen at least 2-3 males. I would say these are Residents.
<br/><b>09:10 -</b> another group of orcas trailing; one male mid channel north of buoy, with 2-3 others west of buoy. All steady southbound. Too far for IDs yet
<br/><b>09:05 -</b> at least <b>3 orcas Southbound</b> at Yellow mid channel buoy between <b>Richmond Beach/Presidents Point, Kingston</b>. Some foraging along the way. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>07:40</b> I saw them too! Getting spoiled to keep seeing them on daily walks. Viewing from Edmonds fishing pier just north or <b>Kingston</b> ferry terminal trending south. Probably south of the terminal by now. -Michell Goll

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>07:35 -</b> I can't believe I'm messaging this for the third time in a week, but I'm seeing a male Orca fin off <b>Edmonds</b> mid channel, headed south. There might be more, but it's far enough out that I could be missing smaller fins. -Josh Adams

Tue Nov 6 - <b>15:30-16:00 - Henderson Bay</b>. I saw them heading toward Purdy Spit first. They stalled for a bit out in the middle of the bay. I thought there were two male separate from each other but never saw them at the same time. Then I saw them heading out of Henderson Bay but not directly toward Cutts Island then I lost them....My neighbors say they saw more than I did heading toward Purdy Spit. Maybe the group split up.

Tue Nov 6 - On November 6th, 2018 at about <b>8:30 AM</b>, (+/-)  I spotted <b>a pod of orcas heading NW out of Dana Passage</b>, mid channel between Hartstene Island and Dickensen Point. There were 6 or 7 in the pod, including two large adult males. The pod appeared to be traveling in a relatively tight group with no animals straying far from the group. I was able to observe them for two breathing cycles of the pod, and then they disappeared. -Bob Burreson

Just had a report from Susan Marie Andersson, of a large group that she is pretty sure is the <b>J pod group who were seen from Fay Bainbridge Park</b>, but they flipped and headed north toward Port Madison at 11:45. They went out of her view but she is hoping to relocate and confirm that it is Js, but due to large pod size and a male that looked like L87, it sounds like maybe Js are now headed north.

<b>11:30 - </b>watching from Bainbridge Island at <b>Fay Bainbridge Park</b>, I would guess <b>6-8 Orca</b> swam past us at about 100 yards. SUPER EXCITING!

Sat Nov 3 - Puget Sound - on the Saratoga was another windy day, though thankfully not quite as choppy. Very quickly after we left the dock, we encountered the <b>T46s and T46Cs heading quickly south in Puget sound from Possession Point. We noticed that T46C had a new calf in tow!</b> We left the orcas to tour Colvos Rocks and watch Harbor Seals and Bald Eagles, but found them again <b>just north of Elliot Bay</b>. The family was a bit more relaxed and not traveling as close together so we got even better looks at the calf. We left them again to watch a Steller Sea Lion and then tour Elliot Bay before heading back to Edmonds. -Justine Buckmaster
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sat Nov 3 - November 3 we found the <b>T46 pod, T46C pod, and T122 near Edmonds </b>on the MV Saratoga. It was a true highlight to see the brand new calf traveling with the T46C pod. We saw the calf many times as it came up next to a number of different members of the pod. It came up most often next to T46C, but it also surfaced next to T122, and others. We will await confirmation from whale researchers for the official word on who the mom is. The three big teenage males in these two pods - T46C1, T46D, and T46E hung back from the bigger group of females and subadults that were surrounding the new calf. T46E and T46C1 were spending a bunch of time together as a duo, and T46D was trailing closer to the females and young. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express.

...on the Chilkat Express was a very windy, very choppy day. That didn't stop us or the whales! We found the <b>T46s in Saratoga Passage</b> heading quickly north, stopping once to feed, then powering north through the waves again. It was a beautiful sight to see. Definitely worth getting a little seasick for. -Justine Buckmaster

Male dorsals look like T46s. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
