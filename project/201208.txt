Encounter # 60 - <b>J, K, L pods in Haro Strait</b>.
<br/>Center for Whale Research
<br/>*<br/>
'Mystic Sea' went the distance to <b>Tsawwassen ferry dock, BC</b>, to spend time with members of<b> J pod</b> enjoying the Fraser River salmon. Active whales traveling at speed among the whitecaps - and little J49 knows how to breach...
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Today we saw several members of the resident <b>L-pod</b> actively feeding offshore of <b>South Beach, SJI</b>, (48°26'N, 123°00'W). First we saw members of the <b>L12 matriline</b>, including <b>L41 "Mega"</b>. He was switching directions and slowly coming to the surface. At one point he rolled on his back and slapped the water with his pectoral fins and tail. We also saw L94 "Calypso" with her calf L113 "Molly". "Molly" was very active, splashing, rolling, tail-slapping. L77 "Matia" was also spotted with her calf L119 born earlier in 2012.San <br/>Juan Safaris Naturalist Jenny

<b>11:51 am -</b> Just left the <b>T69As and T41s off point no point (BC)</b>.
<br/><b>9:12 am - </b>Just received a call <b>possible transients off sooke</b>.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:30 PM -</b> Just south of <b>Protection Island in Discovery Bay</b>. A large Orca (ID'd as<b> T30</b>) passed by our boat while we were waiting for the tide to change to enter Cape George Marina. We noted spouts from 4 additional Orcas in the distance.

<br/>*<br/>
I was fishin' at <b>lagoon pt. </b>-- and at about <b>7:45'ish</b>.... i - and the other 4 guyz &amp; 1 gal who were fishin' saw <b>a HUGE 'thing'</b> burst out of the water - about 30-40 ydz from shore - it was NOT a seal / sea lion .... and it was NOT a porpoise = this 'thing' had a very large &amp; blunt - sorta rounded  (NOT pointed) 'nose' - and a broad head ... THATZ all that was visible - whenst 'IT' surfaced... az it immediately dove down.... then - about 50 ydz further south - it 'surfaced' again ... tho' not az much was visible...it seemed to be following the 'rip' ....southward = towardz Bush pt. we ALL were sure twaz some sort of whale...whatcha thimk ?!?!??

Encounter # 59 - <b>J, K, L pods from Haro Strait, East Point</b>.
<br/>Center for Whale Research
<br/>*<br/>
We caught up with <b>four Southern Resident Killer Whales near False Bay</b>. This group of Killer Whales included <b>Cappuccino (K21)</b> a mature male born in 1985, as well as, <b>Opus (K16)</b> and her son <b>Sonata (K32)</b>. The whales were initially traveling southeast before changing direction and double-backing to the west. Further to the west we spent time viewing another group of Killer Whales near Pile Point (48°28.0017N, 123°05.6076W). All in all there were roughly <b>20 whales spread out</b> along the <b>southern end of San Juan Island</b>.  Although the whales were largely spending their time traveling, a few individuals performed aerial displays; in total we saw 5 breaches!  Crazy AWESOME!
<br/>Amy, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching and Wildlife Tours
<br/>*<br/>  
Today we had <b>J's and some K's heading north past Turn Pt</b> including <b>K20, K38, K25 and K34</b> heading towards the Pender Bluffs.

<b>11:11 - Echolocation</b> and a few <b>squeaks </b>on <b>Lime Kiln</b>, too. 
<br/>Gayle Swigart
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:00</b> - start hearing faint <b>calls </b>and echolocation on <b>OrcaSound</b>.
<br/><b>10:44am - </b>an abundance of vocalizations and echolocation continues 
<br/><b>10:20 - </b>start hearing echolocations....louder now at 10:27a
<br/><b>10:00 am - Calls on Lime Kiln</b>. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:26 -</b> Starting to hear more <b>K pod calls</b>.
<br/><b>10:13 - Orcas heading north from False Bay!</b>
<br/><b>10:04 -</b> Sounds like<b> K pod</b>!
<br/>Melisa Pinnow 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:22 am -</b> Heading west now fill speed!!!! This is weird they may have picked up <b>transients</b>.
<br/><b>9:27 am - </b>Lots of <b>orcas </b>inbound near <b>sooke</b>!!!
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:10 am -</b> Report of <b>Orcas </b>off Sheringham light near <b>Sooke </b>this morning. Unknown if Resident or Transient heading East

<b>2 or 3 grey whales </b>feeding for over 2 hours just east of Shipwreck point in front of <b>Chito Beach Resort, Sekiu</b> (20 miles east of Neah Bay in the Strait of Juan de Fuca).

<b>August 29, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Another amazing day out on the ocean. <b>Transient killer whales</b> were again sighted and turned out to be the <b>T60 group</b>. They were spotted less than a mile from <b>a Humback whale </b>which they left alone. They then made their way West in the <b>middle of Juan De Fuca Strait</b> and swam past<b> a minke whale</b> and <b>a school of harbor porpoise</b>. Soon they locked onto <b>a Dall's porpoise</b> and the lead female T60 began breaching at full speed at the swift little porpoise. The rest of the pod seemed to not know how to handle the foraging behavior. This may be due to inexperience because of the younger whales in this group. The Dall's porpoise fled the female orca and the hunt was stopped. It seemed the mother was giving a hunting demonstration to her offspring.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>California - Pt. Sur</b> Clipper was on the whales before we were, and I guess there was a male with this group [of <b>orcas</b>] before but we didn't get a chance to see him. We caught up with the group at about <b>12:15</b> at 48/00 and stayed with them until <b>1pm</b>. They were moving NW at about 5 knots and then did a 180 and started to chase something... we could see the tips of their dorsal fins zipping under the surface and two of them porpoised completely out of the water. We didn't get a look at what they caught, but they quickly moved on afterwards to the NW. We ended up at 49/02 before going home.

<br/>*<br/> 
At <b>5:30 PM</b> I was fishing from my boat on my buoy and was startled by a very loud blow and turned to see a <b>Humpback </b>surface about 300ft from me. I live about in the middle of <b>Mutiny Bay</b>. It then surfaced about 10-12 more times as it was heading <b>toward Bush Point</b>. There was a small inflatable following it for about 4-5 miles. Pretty sweet evening!
<br/>Robert Armbruster
<br/>*<br/> 
Spotted a single <b>whale </b>in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, immediately east of <b>Eglon Wa</b>. Swimming north towards point no point at <b>3:15p.m</b>. Possibly a <b>humpback</b>. Seemed too small for a Gray.
<br/>David Williams
<br/>*<br/> 
Just missed the pic but what a close encounter we just had with <b>humpback</b>. Fluked right next to our boat at 1500 heading north about<b> 2 miles north of Kingston </b>quarter mile from shore.  Very cool finish to our sail today :)

<b>3:30 PM -</b> The Three Minketeers:<b> 3 Minke Whales</b> out in <b>Haro Strait</b>, just south of Salmon Bank and San Juan Island (48°24.97N 122°59.02). Doing their Minke thing, traveling from bait ball to bait ball and lunging after any food in their course.

Encounter # 58-1 &amp; 58-2 - <b>T18, T19's, T60's and T2B in Haro Strait and the Gulf Islands</b>.
<br/>Center for Whale Research
<br/>*<br/>
South of <b>Henry Island</b> (48°35.33N, 123°12.53W) we began to see spray...the spray of <b>four transient orcas</b>! They were moving towards the northeast, hugging the shoreline. We believe this group included <b>T19B</b>.  Just to the west, closer to <b>Sydney Island </b>(48°37.30N, 123°15.69W) we observed another group of four transients, possibly <b>T60s</b>, milling and then moving to the northeast. 
<br/>San Juan Safaris Naturalist Jenny
<br/>*<br/>
I would like to report a whale sighting: At approximately <b>2:30 PM </b> aboard the Sea Lion of San Juan Safaris, we sighted a group of <b>3-4 transient orcas</b> swimming south along the shore of <b>Sidney Island</b> (Haro Strait). The was 1 male and 2-3 females following closely behind. They were surfacing in rapid succession, then diving for an extended period of time.. I heard something about the T60 pod, but I cannot be sure it was about these whales. Later, at about <b>3:15</b>, we saw <b>another transient pod</b>, also with 1 male and a few females, but this group was surfacing and circling a point in the water. Perhaps they were tracking prey, or engaging in some other activity. 
<br/>Joshua Glant (12-year old whale fan and orcanetwork.org reader!) (_^){ 
<br/>*<br/>
We watched them attack and apparently eat a harbour porpoise in<b> Swanson Channel </b>opposite<b> Pender bluffs</b>. Another big leap was involved in this kill, although not as high. And on<b> Aug. 26-27 (both days) they did a loop across the Victoria</b> waterfront, occasionally munching on seals and causing shrieks of excitement from onlookers as they cruised close in to the Dallas Road shoreline, including directly below Victoria's iconic Ogden Point breakwater. Same route, both nights!

<b>L41 Mega and other L podders were off Otter Point</b> heading west.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
Minda at the Marine Mammal Institute in <b>Newport OR </b>called to relay a report phoned in at <b>8 am</b> of <b>20 orcas</b> at 44 57.5 by 124 46.8, which is about 20 miles due west of <b>Lincoln City OR</b>.

Encounter # 57 -<b> K's and L's off Point Roberts,</b>
<br/>Center for Whale Research
<br/>*<br/>
We had an amazing group of resting<b> L's just east of Point Roberts. L90 and L92 </b>are on the far left.

At work today on the M V Quinsam at <b>1130 </b>hrs I reported approx <b>8 killer whales off Jack Pt., Nanaimo Harbour </b>to the Whale Reporting System and MCTS.
<br/>Fred Wicks
<br/>*<br/> 
The weather was perfect: high around 70 degrees, clear blue sky, and very light breeze. We ran north - through beautifully calm water, enjoying the spectacular scenery. As we got nearer to our destination, members of <b>J &amp; K Pods</b> showed themselves.  Plenty of porpoising, a breach, a spy hop, another breach - lots of activity.  We identified <b>K-25 (Scoter), K-27 (Deadhead), J-27 (Blackberry)</b>, and a host of other gorgeous <b>Orcas</b>. It's what we do. 48 47.91N,  122 46.7436W (10-12 miles north of <b>Lummi Island</b>).
<br/>Captain Jim, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/> 
We found <b>transients at Otter Point</b> foraging near shore at a kelp bed. They traveled from Secretary Island to Race Rocks doing inshore foraging within 200m. Circling each haul out they consumed 4 harbor seals. The identification of the transients was the T60s (T60, T60C, T60D, T60F, T60E). While foraging inshore 200m their respirations were some what synchronous. They did typical 30 second passes near harbor seal haul outs. The transients went offshore near Race Rocks where they killed and consumed a harbor seal. They were spotted a half mile from a mother humpback whale and calf but no interaction between the species was encountered. An example of prey handling time interval:
<br/>Dive times: 1st 4.5 minutes, 2nd 3.8 minutes, 3rd 5.1 minutes.
<br/>Dive average was 4.46 minutes.
<br/>Time from encounter to time of death, Tk= 5 minutes.
<br/>Time from death to complete consumption or abandonment, Te= 4.2 minutes.

Orca Network received a report from Shawn Henderson, who saw <b>a Humpback around 5:30 or 6 pm</b> in the Salmon Beach/<b>Tacoma Narrows</b> area as well.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 pm -</b> We just saw a <b>very large whale</b> in the water south of the <b>Narrows</b> bridge between Day Island and Point Fosdick area.

I want to report a whale sighting in the <b>Puget Sound</b> area for your records.  The whale was spotted about <b>12:15pm</b> on the ferry route between <b>Steilacoom and Anderson Island</b>, as well as the return at <b>4pm</b>.  The whale was alone, and I believe it was a Grey whale, definitely not an Orca.  We saw no unusual markings.  The whale come up to the surface and quickly returned below.

<i>Note: Considering the other reports and photos confirming a humpback, this <b>may have been the humpback</b>.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>August 26, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Type of whale seen:  <b>humpback </b>whale  (field marks used to confirm ID: triangular dorsal fin with rounded tip and hump in front; easily visible blow that extended up to 2 m from the surface and was conical (v-shaped); the blow was clearly visible from at least 1.5 km; flukes with uneven trailing edge and white along the trailing edge; each time it sounded, it fluked.
<br/>Number of animals seen: 1
<br/>47deg 20' 13 sec N, 122deg 45' 43 sec W  (between Dash Point State Park and Vashon Island in the middle of the channel)
<br/>Direction of travel: South (towards Commencement Bay)
<br/>What was the whale doing: Traveling and possibly feeding. It sounded on multiple occasions and fluked at least twice. We initially observed the whale from our sea kayaks. We were approximately 500m offshore of <b>Dash Point State Park</b> when we heard the blow behind us (farther out in the channel). The whale was SW of our position by about 400-500m. It continued swimming down the channel to the south. I am a seabird ecologist and conservation biologist and have spent considerable time at sea conducting seabird and marine mammal surveys. I am confident that the animal we observed was a humpback. A colleague of mine, Dr. Kristin Laidre of UW, who is a marine mammal ecologist and whale expert saw the whale from shore and also confirmed that it was a <b>humpback</b>. 
<br/>Peter Hodum, Ph.D.
<br/>*<br/>
Type: probably a <b>humpback</b>.
<br/>Number: <b>one</b>, with one or two pilot whales? (Note: possibly these were the Risso's dolphins seen recently in Puget Sound) Following about 1,000 yards behind.
<br/>Location:  about 300 feet from shore straight out from 43rd street, <b>Federal Way, near Dumas Bay</b>.
<br/>Direction travelling: east to west
<br/>Date &amp; time: 8/26/12, <b>5:00PM+</b>
<br/>Appeared to be feeding
<br/>Appeared to be a white patch on the right underside of the tail fluke
<br/>Carl Jonasson
<br/>*<br/>
I am just wanting to know if the whale many of us saw close to <b>Lincoln Park </b>was a humpback or a gray. In researching and looking at photos, to me it seemed most like a humpback but I didn't think that was possible this time of year in this location. Wondering if there were any reports from yesterday Sunday the 26th of any humpbacks in sound near Seattle?
It did several blows, and dived.  We saw it dive twice and each time its fluke/tail came fully out of the water.  It was dark gray without a visible dorsal fin, or a very small one, and looked like that classic humpback angle on the back.  It came up right in front of two standing paddle surfers (the kind who stand and paddle on boards).  Very big, very exciting.
<br/>Ellen Blau
<br/><i>Note: From the photos above it was a <b>humpback</b>.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Encounter # 55-1 and 55-2 - <b>J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait</b>. The encounter began at <b>8:22 am</b> when we found <b>J2 </b>passing San Juan County Park. Trailing behind her were the <b>K12's and K13's</b>.  The whales were spread out in loose groups travelling north in Haro Strait. In the distance off Bellevue Point, several large groups of whales worked their way up the strait as their exhales got closer and closer. More on the this encounter and incredible photos at the link above.

<b>12:59 - Orcas</b> (more than one) off <b>Fauntley cove/ ferry dock (West Seattle)</b>, heading south.

<br/>*<br/>
Eric Strachan observed a pod of<b> 9 - 12 orcas</b> between<b> 6:30 - 7 am</b> this morning while he was fishing from the old concrete dock on the <b>Fox Island pier </b>(SE Fox Island, south of the Tacoma Narrows) - the orcas were mid-channel.
<br/>*<br/>
We observed between <b>10-15 members of L pod </b>that were spread out south of <b>False Bay</b> and heading to the southeast (48°25.25N, 123°05.87W). Five to six orcas were surfacing in a tight-knit group. Three other individuals were at least 500 yards away to the south and east, but traveling in the same direction. One orca breached twice; what an incredible splash!  We believe we spotted the <b>L85 "Mystery"</b> in the group, and two-year-old L116 with mother L82 "Kasatka".

<b>11:17 - Super Pod all around the West Side SJI</b> today!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:05 - Orcas</b> heading north from <b>False bay</b>, I believe I saw Ocean Sun L25 :)
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
This morning I got to Land Bank on the<b> west side of San Juan Island </b>at <b>8:20 AM</b>, just as the last group of the <b>superpod </b>whales were heading north. In this group were at least: <b>J16, J26, J27, L83, L110, L47, L115, L72, L92, L105, L95, L26, L90, and L91</b>. I went up to <b>San Juan County Park</b> then, where large groups of active whales continued to head north between <b>9 and 9:30</b> a little ways offshore. Later, with word the whales had turned back south, I went back out to Lime Kiln Point State Park where <b>K21, K16, and K36 </b>passed by heading south at <b>11 AM</b>. They were followed by the <b>rest of K-Pod at 11:40</b>. As Ks continued south (towards the L12 sub-group who remained off the south end all day), another large group of whales was visible several miles to the north and offshore, presumably <b>J-Pod and the rest of L-Pod</b>.

My last report was 7 years ago from <b>North Pender Island</b>. Today a big thrill spotting <b>5 T's at 12:30 pm</b> hunting a seal off Downes Point (SE corner of Hornby Island). Tracked them eastwards still circling their prey to the northeast side of outer Tribune Bay. Big ones and a teenager making up the pod. The big one did not come across as a male with no strong vertical dorsal - just not sure. They continued circling and chasing down their prey below our cliifside vantage point. After a while they headed southeast towards Flora Islet at the east tip of Helliwell Provincial Park before heading south into the Strait of Georgia (towards Lasqueti Island?).

Orcas or humpbacks, or grays?
<br/>We received a call from Al Vonner of Olympic National Park, out of the <b>Ozette Ranger Station</b>, relaying a report that <b>4 whales</b> had been observed 1/2 - 1 mile off Sand Point, on the north coast on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday, August 21 - 22 by himself, and by some campers. He <b>wasn't sure if they were orcas or humpbacks</b> - he didn't see any white, and the blows were very high and could be heard at night by the campers. One of the campers seemed to think they were humpbacks, but Al's description of the fin sounded like they may have been larger fins than what would be seen on a humpback from such a distance. There was a previous report of<b> 4 orcas off the Quileute River the night of the 21st</b>, heading north, so not sure if this may have been the same 4 whales possibly patrolling the area for a few days, or if it was actually humpbacks.

My husband and I had been aboard our sailboat in <b>Desolation Sound, Aug 10 - 22</b>. We saw many seals and a few dolphins. Much to my surprise, after leaving the Outspan Coast and hopping a BC Ferry back to the city ... Orcas! Sadly, no photos, as the camera was in the car and I was on the deck. Sighted b<b>etween Saltery Bay and Earls Cove</b> (heading south), <b>2:20 p.m. on August 22</b>. We got a very good look at <b>four Orcas</b> who were swimming along just off the port side. One was large (large fin on his back), two slightly smaller, and what seemed to be a very little one too. In the distance, we saw a couple more spouts, but were not close enough to get a good look at what/who it was!

They just circled the bay (a basin) once each time they were in. The attached pictures hopefully show identifying marks. I have other pictures showing other info if anyone would be interested.

Hell of a day! We met up with the <b>T36s, T37s, and T99s in Sansum Narrows</b>, between Maple Bay and Crofton around <b>11am</b>. They were very active at the surface for over 30 minutes, pec slapping, tail slapping, and even some breaching from the younger animals in the group (<b>T36B1 and T99C</b>). In the afternoon, they were still within the Salt Spring Island area of the Gulf Islands, this time off the northern tip of Secretary Island at approx. 15:00. Continuing with the trend from the morning, they were very "playful" at the surface. They made at least one kill during this time, as the gulls began to congregate overhead, and the orcas converged into a cluster to rip apart their prey.

I thoroughly enjoy following the Orca Network emails and photos, and I am especially a huge fan of Capt Jim Maya's photos. I had the great privilege of going on a whale watch with Capt Jim  and we saw 4 transients (<b>T18's I believe? T18, T19, T19-B, and T19-C</b>) in <b> Canadian waters north ofSnug Harbor</b>. Orcas are my absolute favorite animal, and this was truly an incredible day. I've been on whale watches before, and even on a few in the San Juans before, but nothing can compare to the wonderful experience I had with Jim and his assistant Jeanne. I've seen J- and K-pod Residents before, but never Transients. I was beyond excited. We were able to witness them hunting harbor seals! I am passing along a few photos, although I'm sure Capt Jim outdid me with his wonderful photography. We saw the orcas cruise along the shore while hunting, and we even witnessed a few fluke slaps. In the tail fluke image, there appears to be a harbor seal tail just to the right of the orca.

<b>5 Transient Orcas</b> came into the Salish Sea today, made a kill, and quickly headed back for open water.

We live on <b>Stuart Island</b> (West side) watching <b> ~ 5 whales</b> headed north on Sunday at <b>12:06PM</b> and were sad to see a vessel headed south that was a white pleasure craft fiberglass boat 30+ft with in board motors and a black canvas top- dingy covering the name. This vessel drove right into the whales ( never slowed down) such that they needed to swim under the vessel. Multiple whale watching craft were near the site of this happening floating at a respectful distance and seemed that their presence should have provided awareness of the whales nearby.

The waters on the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> were calm which made the observation of surface activity noticeable! We spotted a harbor porpoise making quick dives just off the bow of the boat.

Feeding in the surface waters, it was silently cruising for schooling fish and plankton (48°24.88N, 122°51.61W).

I live about 1/4 mile north of the<b> Tacoma Narrows </b>bridge, on the water, on the <b>Gig Harbor</b> side. About 10 minutes ago, we watched two Orcas heading north at a pretty good clip, with the outgoing tide. They were hugging the Tacoma side of the narrows. I have not seen any emails from you with sightings this far south so was very excited, of course. We have a good pair of Steiner binoculars, so I am confident they were Orcas...not confident of the number though...it i was at least two. Now that I have typed this, my husband tells me they are heading back south and are now back in front of our house, but across the water still on the Tacoma side. I will keep you posted.

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called in a report of <b>transients in East Sound</b> early in the afternoon, where they found and killed several seals over several hours. Mystic Sea posted this on their fb page "......before continuing up to East Sound, Orcas Island, where we were the very first whale watching boat on scene. Starting out with some wild splashing and tumultuous waters, we knew right away that the Transient Orcas had just made a kill. Soon after, we saw the blood in the water and could see two of the larger bulls tossing a seal back and forth (sad but nature). We identified these Transients as being the <b>T36 and T37</b> pods."
<br/>*<br/>
We were with <b>around 8 transients</b> yesterday near <b>East Sound at Orcas island </b>from around <b>4:00 to 4:45</b>. We think some of the transients were the <b>T36s</b>. They were definitely in hunting mode as they swam over to rocks were seals were hauled out. They hugged the rocks and it looked like they were creating waves to wash the seals off of the rocks. They also were tail/pec/dorsal fin slapping, sharking, spy hopping and breaching.

When we arrived in <b>East Sound </b>we saw <b>7 Transient Killer Whales </b>traveling south down the middle of the sound (48°37.366N, 122°52.303W). Generally Transient Killer Whales travel in small groups, 3-5 individuals, and are stealthy and elusive as they are hunting marine mammals. However, this pod was very surface active: spyhopping, lobtailing, cartwheeling and rolling around at the surface. We were all excited to witness the variety of behaviors and had excellent views as the whales changed direction and surprised us by cruising against the shore.

Center for Whale Research Encounter #48 * <b>J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait</b> - excerpt from the commentary by Ken Balcomb: "We think that it is quite interesting that the arrival of K pod from the north yesterday and L pod from the west today in a sort of pincer movement around Vancouver Island is suggestive of some sort of pre-planning on the part of the whales. Of course, if there were gobs of Chinook salmon coming into the core habitat area from both directions at the same time that could serendipitously explain the coincident timing of arrival. But, by all official accounts there are not good returns of Chinook salmon to this area from any direction."

Killer Whales from both <b>K- and L-Pods </b>were headed north along the westside of <b>San Juan Island</b>. The whales were reported heading north from Lime Kiln State Park. We caught up with the leaders near <b>Open Bay</b> (48°34.824N, 123°11.685W) who were mostly members of K-Pod. We traveled with these whales to Kellett Bluff where we waited for the rest of the group to travel north. We saw over 15 whales as they cruised by. At times we were surrounded by whales as a few individuals were traveling further offshore as well as the whales that were seen ahead and behind us; we didn't know in which direction to look! It was wonderful. Since the seas were flat calm, we even had a chance to turn off the engine and just enjoy the sunshine and the whales, listening to them exhale as they surfaced. Sigh. It was marvelous.

By the time we reached the whales today, near <b>Saturna Island</b> (Canada), people had lined up along the shoreline waiting for their chance to see the <b>Southern Residents</b>. It was <b>six members of J pod</b> slowly moving north in <b>Boundary Pass</b> headed for the Strait of Georgia (48°45.88N 123°04.69W). In the mix we found <b>Hy'Shqa (J37)</b> and her newborn <b>J49</b>, along with Grandma <b>Samish (J14)</b> and the 20 year-old orphan from Lpod, <b>Onyx (L87)</b>. The group appeared to be resting, staying fairly close to the shoreline, synchronizing their breaths and dives. When we came back for our second visit the group of whales began lobtailling and playing around with one another. We then headed home with news of K pod entering the area.

<b>Members of J pod</b> had spread out almost half the length of San Juan traveling south in <b>Haro Strait</b> between <b>Lime Kiln and False Bay</b> (48°32.15N, 123°00.87W). The first whale we encountered was <b>Doublestuff (J34)</b> rolling around and traveling amongst a few females enjoying the sunshine and family time. The next group we came across was Hy'Shqa (J37) and her VERY new born calf J49 with Grandma <b>Samish (J14)</b> monitoring close behind. What a blessing to see the little one so healthy and keeping up right alongside mama!!! Then we ran into <b>Onyx (L87)</b> foraging by his lonesome and out of nowhere popped up <b>Blackberry (J27)</b> right off our stern. I swear he has a "thing" for the Kittiwake because he always pays us a visit on that boat! The last family we encountered were the J16s; Mama <b>Slick (J16)</b> leading her offspring and Big<b> Mike (J26)</b>.

Wow - what a day for <b>Transient orcas </b>in the Salish Sea! We finally were able to get out to look for them in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, and first saw them from Lagoon Pt. at 5:55 pm, heading north at a fast pace. We observed two pods, including 1 male, mid-channel - by <b>6:20 pm </b>they had passed <b>Lagoon Pt</b>. looked like they were heading toward Admiralty Bay. We headed up to a bluff on the border of Ft. Casey/Camp Casey, and found the orcas as the first group had just passed Ft. Flagler on Marrowstone Island, at about <b>6:45 pm</b>. They were off <b>Pt. Townsend</b> by ~<b>6:55 pm</b>, and another group followed and were off Pt. Townsend by about <b>7:05 pm</b>. A third group followed, passing Pt. Townsend at about <b>7:15 pm</b>. They all continued heading west at a good clip; the three groups seeming to be traveling a bit closer together. We left at <b>7:25 pm</b> and they appeared to be continuing west <b>toward Pt. Angeles</b>. This made up for missing them last night when they headed into Admiralty Inlet! Brad Hanson of NOAA was able to spend much of the day with them, so we will get more ID's by next week.

<br/>*<br/>
Just heard from my friend at <b>Bush Pt</b>, Barbara Mundell - they got their spotting scope out and the whales were off Bush Pt. at<b> 7:43</b>, a group of <b>7</b>, including a young one. This fits with the sighting off Pt. Ludlow, and makes the 4th smaller Transient pod heading out of Puget Sound today. We saw a total of ~14 - 18 orcas in the first 3 groups, with 7 more, that makes <b>21 - 25 total Transients in Puget Sound and Admiralty Inlet </b>today - incredible!

<br/>*<br/> 
While sailing, we saw a pod of <b>6 or 7 orcas</b> swimming north not far off the <b>Edmonds </b>marina. I got some pictures. If someone can identify the individual whales from the pictures, then that would be great. They were swimming fast in a northerly direction. We saw them about <b>3 pm</b>.
<br/>Martin Proudfoot
<br/>*<br/> 
From the numbers we saw, my guess is these two groups met up. At <b>4:15</b> Ed, Pam, and I left Edmonds where we could still see the <b>Transients </b>surfacing mid channel of <b>Pt No Pt &amp; Scatchet Head</b>, appeared they were nearing Useless Bay. We still could not discern if they were heading up Admiralty or towards Possession. Research boat still with them.
<br/><b>3:40 - T's</b> are zig-zagging. Difficult to say if they'll head up Admiralty.

Graeme Dewitt of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the <b>Edmonds/Kingston</b> ferry of <b>at least two orcas</b> in the ferry lane, headed north.
<br/>*<br/> 
Ferry enroute to <b>Kingston </b>dock. Announcement over the loud speaker of <b>killer whales</b> off the port bow at about <b>2:45</b>. Two whales rapidly approached the ferry, a large, adult male with a slight bend in the tip of the dorsal fin (tip bent toward the right side) following either a large juvenile or female. Both surfaced quite close to the ferry, within fifty feet, headed north and directly perpendicular to the port side of the ferry. Saddle patches were large and appeared to be closed but the whales did not fully expose the entire saddle patch. Unfortunately I did not have my camera or cell phone but lots of folks were taking pics. Hope you get an ID.

We saw <b>two groups of orcas</b> in the area between <b>Shilshole and Bainbridge Island</b>. We sighted the first group between between<b> 1230 and 1 p.m</b>., between West Point and Shilshole, less than a mile offshore, heading North. They were moving right along in a straight line, and I would think that they were transiting, rather than playing or feeding. There were at least 6-7 total, and maybe more. The main group was bunched together pretty closely, and there may have been a young one in the mix (based on size). <b>A male with a very tall dorsal</b> was traveling about 30-50 yards behind the main group. There appeared to be a faint grayish marking 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up the big male's dorsal. About half an hour later (1:20 p.m.) we saw a smaller group about .8 miles off of Fay Bainbridge park, also heading North. This group appeared to be made up of 3-4 orcas total. There was a male traveling with this group, although his dorsal was not as tall as the previous one that we saw. This male had a slight bend to his dorsal, and a prominent gray saddle immediately aft of the dorsal. Sadly, we twice heard people call the Coast Guard on the radio to report boats traveling too close to the orcas, once before we saw them, and once almost an hour later. As you can imagine, there were a fair number of boats in the area on such a nice day, but everyone seemed to be keeping a good distance off when we saw the orcas. And to top it off, saw a few harbor porpoises a little Northwest of where we saw the second group of orcas.

Attached are a few photos of Orcas seen today at the south end of<b> Bainbridge Island</b>. We first spotted them some distance away on the west side of Blake Island - about 4 seen. Then numbers increased and we estimated <b>10-15 whales</b> in total, and they then headed over to where we were fishing at the south end of Bainbridge. I'm sure lots of people on the Bremerton-Seattle ferry got photos also, but have a attached a few. We saw them at 11<b>am to approx. noon</b> where they headed north following the east side of Bainbridge - a few seemed to be playing and/or feeding - splashing and lifting their tales out of the water.

I got to see them from <b>Ft. Casey</b>, first saw them a little north of Port Townsend, well north of the ferry terminal, then they traveled slowly across the ferry lanes towards Ft. Flagler but I would say mid-channel but more so closer to the Pt Townsend side, south side of the straits, about <b>4 of them</b>. One boat was following them...one had a nice size dorsal fin. I think I was at Ft Casey starting around <b>6:30 pm until 8ish</b>. at that point they were straight across at the Ft. Flagler side and still moving south, making it harder for me to see them.

Around <b>5:00 pm </b>a report of a group of <b>five transient (mammal hunting) killer whales, the T30s</b>, were sighted <b>near Victoria </b>British Columbia Canada. The group traveled at high speed south of Victoria towards Race Rocks Pacific Ecological reserve, last sighted at Beacher Bay, a famous harbor seal haul out. 
The T30s are comprised of an older Matriarch T30 (estimated birth 1967), her son T30A (born 1986), daughter T30B (born 1993), her calf T30B1, and possible female T30C (born 2005). T30A the only full grown male of the group and is very distinguishable from other males by his dorsal fin which tilts slightly to the left. Within the last year T30B gave birth to her first calf T30B1 who already has a distinguishing little notch at the base of the dorsal fin. This group has been seen feeding on harbor seals near shore within 200m around haulouts. They sometimes travel with companions like T46B and calf T46B2 and the T19s. Sightings of this group have become more frequent over the last 7 years Let us just hope we get more opportunities with this amazing group of animals.

This <b>humpback </b>was later identified as <b>#409</b>. We counted almost 20 breaches in addition to peck slaps and great fluke-up dives! We encountered the humpback near<b> Andrews Bay</b> on the west side of San Juan Island.

From <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b> we watched a <b>humpback </b>in resting mode traveling fairly slowly northbound in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Suddenly she/he breached and continued to breach (about 25 in all), pec slap, roll, and fluke diving. Spirits were with us all this beautiful sunny summer day!

<b>One humpback</b> entertained many people today, with breach after breach after breach. She/he was a little north of <b>Lime Kiln</b> early this afternoon. No orcas, but this was a superb replacement!

We left Friday Harbor heading north with word of <b>a humpback whale</b> in the area. We spotted the distinct, 10 foot plus blow of a large humpback whale just off the west end of <b>Stuart Island</b>. It was traveling north east around Turn Point before making a b-line across the US boarder into Canadian waters. It surfaced two, three, up to four times before living up to it's name and "humping," waving it's fluke in the air before it disappeared and was down for about three to four minutes. We watched this for a while until the pattern was broken when the whale decided to lunge out of the water! It was awesome!

<b>3:30 pm -</b> Eugene Thrasher was at the<b> Admiralty Head Lighthouse</b>, at Ft. Casey, Whidbey Island, when he saw <b>two orcas</b> headed north out of Admiralty Inlet in the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Report relayed by Janet Hall. 
<br/>*<br/>
Morning surprise - We settled in south of the lighthouse at <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b>, and within 5 minutes at <b>9:55am</b>, out of the stillness of the morning, we hear an enormous exhale. A <b>humpback </b>surfaced 100 feet off the rocks where we sat. It surfaced once again, nearly in front of the lighthouse then went down for a deep dive. From the utter surprise, this calm morning erupted into cheers up and down the park and filled us up with wonderment and gratitude. Humpback continued northward last we heard past <b>Speiden Island</b>.

The OCNMS R/V TATOOSH spotted <b>a large pod of orca whales numbering between 20 to 30 animals</b>. Their location was <b>23 nm west - northwest (WNW) of Cape Alava </b>(the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states) and they were traveling in a SSE direction.

<br/><i>Four photos from this sighting showed J14 Samish (grandmother of newborn J49) alongside her grandmother J2 Granny, J8 Spieden, J19 and J32.</i>

Five days and no SRKW's to been seen. Today, an early morning report of a <b>humpback </b>sighting in <b>Haro Strait</b>, and eventual confirmed sightings <b>south of Eagle Point</b>, brought us to American Camp by 1:30. When we arrived at the pullout above South Beach we watched<b> a lone humpback </b>surface in cycles of 5-6 times then deep diving for 4-6 minutes (love those flukes). We saw a couple of breaches, but it mostly zig zagged back and forth in this pattern in and around Salmon Bank until we left at <b>5:00pm</b>. There were also 3 minke in the same general area during this time.
We returned to <b>Cattle Point at 7:15pm</b>, the <b>humpback </b>had moved northbound up <b>San Juan Channel</b>, hugging <b>Lopez</b>, and milling in the kelp. It quickly turned and made its way back around Cattle Point towards Salmon Bank, again zig zagging, deep diving, and one last breach. We left at <b>9:00pm</b>, with the humpback still in that general area.

On the ferry from Bremerton to Seattle, my niece and nephew reported seeing a pod of either <b>4 or 5 Orca whales</b> in<b> Elliot Bay</b> between Bainbridge Island and West Seattle. Only their dorsal fins were visible along. It was around <b>1030am </b>and they were headed away from Seattle. My niece who is fairly familiar with marine life was pretty certain they were Orcas. I hadn't seen any other recent sightings so weren't sure if there was an actual pod in that vicinity.
