<h3><center>May 2009 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>May 31, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Ken Balcomb and Emma Foster of the Center for Whale Research encountered <b>3 transients</b> while in route from <b>Victoria, B.C.</b> to San Juan Island. <b>T109A and calf T109A2</b> were traveling with T12A. 
<br/>Center for Whale Research 
<br/>*<br/>
May 24 &amp; 31 - I have 2 grey Whale sightings to report: May 24 - 8 AM Camano Island at Indian Beach. 1 Grey traveling Southbound 40 yards off of shore.
May 31 3:30 PM to 4:15 We spend 45 minutes with a Grey at Golden Gardens Park. It first breached and blew off of North Beach - then we stayed with it for 45 minutes as it bottom fed along the shore of Golden gardens. sometimes within 30 ' of shore.
<br/>Bill Barks
<br/>*<br/>
This majestic bull <b>T12A </b> was out there keeping company with <b>T109A </b>and <b>T109A2</b>. We had good looks of the three of them slowly heading out west. He has a Dorsal fin rather like Ruffles, full of nice waves. We encountered them just <b>south of Trail Island</b> and they were in a resting pattern with very long dives.
<br/>Marie O'Shaughnessy, Orca-Magic, Prince of Whales 
<br/>*<br/>
Working up here in SE Alaska has giving me yet another opportunity to view our awesome black and white friends in their world. I was out halibut fishing yesterday afternoon in <b>Lynn Canal north of Juneau</b> and had upwards of <b>20 orcas</b> come through. They have been hanging around the area for a couple of weeks and we were finally able to see them. We watched them breach, spyhop and tailslap. One even rolled over on its back and was slapping its fins.
<br/>Eric Ogren 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>9 a.m.</b> we saw a <b>minke </b>whale surface a few times. This was about two miles southwest of <b>Smith Island</b>. Also, all day we saw lots of what we think were <b>Dall's porpoises.</b>
<br/>David Freed 
<br/>*<br/>
We heard that there was a group of <b>Transients </b>in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> near the Romeo marker, so we were happy to hear we had whales in the area. As we left the dock, we heard that it was actually a large group of Transients, <b>numbering between 14-20</b>. Wow! We arrived about 6 miles north of Sequim at <b>1320 </b>and slowly approached the area the whales were sighted. The perfectly glassy calm water made spotting the whales very easy, and we shut down about 450 yards from the group. Amazingly--they were in a definite resting pattern, with all 14 whales slowly rising to the surface in unison in a tight, contact pattern. This went on for about 15 minutes until one of the whales decided "nap time" was over. Then the whales began zig-zagging in what appeared to be a random pattern, breaking into smaller groups and then coalescing into a big group again. Soon the Transients were spy-hopping, tail slapping, and then a swirl of water around 3-4 whales--followed by a bunch of seagulls swarming the area. They had made a stealthy kill, and we can only guess it was a porpoise as there were dozens in the area. This was followed by several breaches!! And for only the 3rd time in 12 years--I witnessed whales swimming backwards four times! It always catches me off-guard to see a dorsal fin going backwards! No vocalizations, but amazing to see Transients so active! We left the scene at 1410 as the whales continued heading easterly.
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called to relay a report of <b>a large group of 18 Transients</b> in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> - the <b>T30's, T100's, T101's, T124's, T90 &amp; T90B</b>. They followed them as they headed east, leaving them at <b>4:30 pm</b> off <b>Pt. Wilson</b>, still heading east. 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb &amp; Emma Foster of the Center for Whale Research had <b>3 other Transient orcas: T12A, T109A, &amp; T109A2</b>, south of <b>Discovery Island</b> at <b>11 am</b>, heading west.
<br/>*<br/>
A pod of <b>orcas </b>went past <b>Pt No Pt</b> (N. Kitsap Peninsula) from <b>8-8:45</b> pm. Two whales were seen at around 8pm by beach walkers and then a second group came by around 8:30pm. There was at least one large male and 3-4 females in the second group. They were travelling <b>south </b>towards Kingston. The second pod hung out about ¼ mile past the lighthouse at Pt No Pt and did some breaching and tail lobs. 
<br/>Patty Michak, MarineView Fisheries Consulting, Inc., Hansville
<br/>*<br/>
Bev Wenthin of <b>Bush Pt</b>. called to report <b>3 orcas</b> just north of Bush Pt. at <b>6:32 pm</b>, heading south. They were between mid-channel &amp; the far side of Admiralty Inlet. 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>2PM </b> off <b>Partridge Point</b> there was a pod of <b>Orcas </b>doing a little fishing. They were probably 10-15 miles offshore from where I am near Partridge Point, so there wasn't a lot of see from my vantage point, but the male's dorsals were unmistakable even from afar.
<br/>Cameron Chandler, Coupeville 
<br/>*<br/>
Cathy Kelly of <b>Saltery Bay, BC</b> (27km south of Powell River) called Orca Network with a sighting of <b>6-8 orcas</b> traveling NE past the Saltery Bay ferry terminal, up Jervis Inlet at <b>11 AM </b>. At least one male and one juvenile were among them. 
<br/>*<br/>
On the trip home we also found a lone <b>minke </b>whale between <b>Middle Bank and Salmon Bank</b>. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
I spotted a <b>Minke Whale</b> heading west. 1.5 miles south of <b>Eagle Point</b> (San Juan Island). I watched the Minke for 45 min. it was traveling at 4 to 6 knots.
<br/>Captain Tommer Roush, t2 charter 
<br/>*<br/>
After telling a friend yesterday that we don't often see whales in <b>Port Townsend Bay</b>, today several groups of rowers saw the <b>Gray whale</b>, roughly between <b>10 and 11 AM</b>, closer to Indian Island than to downtown Port Townsend. It was about 200 yards from our boat, slowly cruising, showing small parts of its body at a time. It was visible for about 3 minutes. It may have been a juvenile, roughly 25 feet long, maybe shorter - comparing it to the length of the skeleton we have at the Marine Science Center. Its body had the typical patches of barnacles but what was more noticeable was the scarring along much of its body, especially on its tail -- long white slashes that may have come from encounters with propellers or possible entanglement with a net. Especially exciting since I remember an earlier visit by a grey on Memorial Day as well (and today "really" is Memorial Day.) 
<br/>Libby Palmer, Port Townsend Marine Science Center, Rat Island Rowing &amp; Sculling Club 
<br/><br/>
<b>May 30, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
We went by boat to Rat Island, located in South <b>Port Townsend Bay</b> at the entrance to Kilisut Harbor. At <b>8:00pm</b> we were picnicking on the North side of the island when a <b>gray whale</b> surfaced and blew approximately 10 meters off shore. It appeared to be between 7 and 10 meters in length and exhibited feeding behavior up and down the North side of the island for the hour we were there.
<br/>Keith Brkich 
<br/>*<br/>
While at <b>Pacific Beach around 2PM</b> we spotted a <b>Grey whale</b> about 100 yards out from shore past the breakers. We saw the spout blow three times and the back of the whale surface once and the tail fins once.
<br/>Jeff Pollock 
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>humpback </b>whale was feeding in the flood tide at the south end of <b>Yucata Rapids</b>, in the Stuart Island BC area. 
<br/>Nick Templeman, Discovery Marine Safaris, Campbell River BC 
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>3.30pm </b>Prince of Whales, Ocean Magic, encountered <b>two Minke Whales</b> at <b>Hein Bank</b>, around <b>4.30pm</b>. They were foraging in large cycles. The collection of gulls and sea birds on the surface would indicate often where these whales were feeding.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic POW 
<br/>*<br/>
We headed out this afternoon into the Strait of Juan De Fuca in search of <b>T40</b>, Cpt. Hook and eventually found him traveling a few miles East of William Head. The sea state was very confused this afternoon but T40 seemed to be taking the surf in his stride. As we observed T40 we noticed a number of directions changes. It was great to see the old guy again.
<br/>Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from a fishing boat four miles due west of <b>Port Orford OR</b>, about twenty (20) orcas heading Northwest at <b>2 PM</b>. At least one male and a baby were present. They came up to the boat, even rubbing it. Photos were taken and will be sent to Orca Network on Monday when they come in.

<br/><br/>
I just received photos from Linda Nichol and Melissa Boogaards who work in our group and it looks like they had <b>L's heading east off Port Hardy BC at 1800</b> this evening. From the photos they sent I could identify: <b>L41, L77, L79,L12, L22, and L89</b>.
<br/>Graeme Ellis, Pacific Biological Field Station, Canada's Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2 Orca Whales</b> seen briefly at <b>14:15</b>, at <b>Three Arch Capes, OR</b> (45 27' 13.41" N, 123 58' 46.87 W) headed south. Appeared to be Swimming quickly. Three Arch Capes is a Breeding Area for Sea Lions.

<br/>*<br/>
We watched a nice sized <b>Gray </b>just off of <b>NAS Whidbey Base</b>. It was feeding, in close to shore. It was just dilly-dallying and showing off its style.
<br/>Caroline Spehar, Marine Naturalist, SSAMIN Member, Mystic Sea
<br/>*<br/>
There were <b>Harbor Porpoises</b> everywhere, herds of them. We also saw a <b>Minke </b>Whale out around Smith and Minor Islands, also feeding.
<br/>Caroline Spehar, Marine Naturalist, SSAMIN Member, Mystic Sea

<br/><br/>
<b>Evening</b>, one <b>gray </b>at <b>Kayak Point</b> feeding close to shore, moving north.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Pt, Snohomish Co. 
<br/>*<br/>
This afternoon (approx. <b>2:15-2:45 PM</b>) from the Western Explorer we observed <b>a gray whale</b> just offshore of the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. It appeared to be feeding as every once and a while a brown plume of mud was visible at the surface.

<br/><i>Jesse Huggins at Cascadia Research writes:
Jill sent some photos of the left side of the same whale as well. This is one of the whales new to the area this year.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Chuck Niedzialkowski reported <b>two gray whales</b> about 100 yards off <b>Whidbey Naval Air Station</b> for several hours from <b>noon to about 2:45</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We watched <b>a gray whale</b> feeding along the west side of Whidbey near Rocky Point, south of the main part of the Navy base. We watched him for about 45 minutes around <b>1 pm</b>. He was in fairly shallow water, and didn't ever show his fluke. I think he's one of the newcomers for 2009.

Gray whale at Spee-Bi-Dah
We just had (<b>9:30am to 10:00am</b>) <b>a grey whale</b> feeding 50 to 75 yards off shore at Spee-Bi-Dah. We have not seen this whale this year. Tail and fin markings are not like any others we have seen this year. Also so was much lighter in color. The feeding pattern was different. Instead of the normal roll and dip this one seem to sink with very little fin and tail action.

I had an incredible experience with a <b>gray whale</b> off Bells Beach on <b>Whidbey Island</b> around <b>12:30 pm</b>. It was a very low tide and I had just brought our boat in and was preparing the anchor when a gray whale came up about 10 feet away - right off shore (the tide was all the way out to the drop-off so it got deep quick). The whale slowly traveled north along the shoreline. At one point I was able to wade out about waist deep and the whale came up about 5 feet away - I could almost touch its tail as it went by (I know I shouldn't have gotten so close but could not resist). He/she appeared to be feeding and came up numerous times without blowing and also rolling on its side and raising a fin, presumably while scooping up goodies on the seabed. My wife jogged along with the whale almost all the way to fox spit where the whale eventually steered out towards Camano and did a terminal dive. Others on the beach were taking pictures so I will try to get copies and forward them along.
<br/>Brent Lewis, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Spotted very small <b>gray whale</b>, lone, feeding very close to shore, Sunset Beach just south of <b>Madrona Beach</b>, (W. Camano Island) , swimming back and forth, <b>7pm</b>.
<br/>Cyndi Harris, Camano Island 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-1</b> with maybe 6 other whales porpoising fast to the southeast around Eagle Point, with a strong flooding tide, at <b>1:13pm</b> They all slowed down around <b>False Bay</b>, going on long dives, appeared to be foraging. We left them at about <b>2pm</b>.
<br/>Caroline Armon, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Don Prior called Orca Network about <b>a gray whale in Holmes Harbor</b>, Saratoga Passage, and the Rocky Point boat ramp. It was a low tide and the whale was in about 10-12' of water. He saw it <b>between 2 and 3 PM</b>, from very close. 
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a <b>pod of Orcas</b> at Cape Flattery around noon today. 
<br/>Diane Forsmark, Port Townsend on vacation up on the Makah Reservation 
<br/>*<br/>
Dave Ellifrit said orcas were heading south <b>in Haro Strait</b>, approaching the Center for Whale Research at <b>12:45 PM</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan was hearing <b>calls on the Lime Kiln Hps at 12:55PM</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>J pod</b> in big seas <b>near Middle Bank</b> headed south this evening about <b>7:00PM</b>. The last time they did this, they were back the next day, after visiting Pt. Angeles.

<br/>*<br/>
Some <b>Ts </b>have been spotted near<b> Coal Island</b>, over near Sidney.

I spent a lot of time at <b>Lime Kiln Park</b> and was able to photograph the <b>J Pod</b> orcas on Friday, twice on Saturday, and again on Sunday. On Saturday, they went north and then came back later that day. I was so glad I stayed as little J45 was practicing his breaching for a good half hour.

We left <b>J Pod</b> going <b>north </b>at the <b>Pender Bluffs</b> yesterday at <b>7:00 PM</b>.
J44 was having a great time strolling along with mom, J 17, and her family.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
Tagging on to Jeff and Cathy's reports of calls on the HPs on Sunday. I was at <b>LimeKiln </b>and have posted a video clip of Samish J-14 and her three youngest - <b>Hy'Shqa J-37, Suttles J-40</b> and baby <b>J-45</b> as they spent time there. It was interesting that with all their activity there were more echo clicks than vocals. Was it a training session or just lunch time?

We had <b>J-Pod riding in the huge flood tide</b>. When we were getting ready to leave the dock, we had a report that J Pod was at Constance Bank heading east, so we hoped they'd be somewhat close by the time we got in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. By the time we made Cattle Point, they were already along the shore of San Juan (must have been the 6 knot current speeding them along!) They were <b>very spread ou</b>t, making any ID's very hard, but I did manage to spot J27 near False Bay. For our second trip in the late afternoon, the whales had made a decision to head north, and we found the trailing whales near <b>Stuart Island</b>. This time however, things were different. The currents were almost ebbing, so the whales had slowed way down. We were lucky enough to find two good-sized groups traveling closely together, and not in a big hurry. Lots of spyhops, tail lobs, rolling on top of each other, and even a sea-snake! We were able to ID <b>J16 Slick, J17 Princess Angeline, J22 Oreo, J27 Blackberry, J28 Polaris, J34 Doublestuff, J35 Tahlequah, J38 Cookie, and new calf J44</b>. We watched the whales pass the Turn Point Lighthouse before heading home, full of smiles!

Jeff Hogan called with a <b>Lime Kiln acoustic</b> alert. J's live on the hydrophones <b>at 1:30 PM</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>13:10</b> I was hearing faint calls on the Lime Kiln Hps. At <b>14:23</b> still hearing calls and clicks on Lime Kiln Hps. At <b>14:54</b> started hearing calls and clicks on OrcaSound Hps. Whales are obviously traveling North.
<br/>Cathy Bacon 
<br/>*<br/>
A call came at <b>9:54 AM</b> in about <b>at least 3 orcas in mid-channel Puget Sound between Sandy Shores Beach, Maury Island, and Federal Way</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Morris called in a report of <b>at least 3 orcas 3-4 miles offshore of Destruction Island</b>, 45 miles south of Cape Flattery, at <b>7:30 AM</b>. Coordinates were 47, 39.14 N X 124, 35.24 W. He said he thought there were two males.

This pod heading north and swimming very fast crossed our helm at <b>11:53 am </b>near the south bound shipping lane <b>between Shilshole Bay and Bainbridge Island</b>. Lat 47 41.89N; Long 122 27.15 W. There were about 5-6 whales including one adult male and one juvenile.

<br/>*<br/>
We watched a large but dispersed set of whales head west between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point on <b>South Lopez</b> mid-day today. They were passing by from about <b>11:45 until 12:15</b> - there were probably more than a dozen, but I don't have a clear count as some were far from shore.

<b>4:30 PM</b> - Sitting on my deck I spotted <b>3-4 orcas definately one male</b>. Heading north then south in the deep traffic channel of the sound. Playing and breaching. going back and forth n to s. We are centered between the Eglon Boat launch and the point no point lighthouse. Could not get a good enough picture for you to send to verify which pod. thanks way exciting for me.

I spent a lot of time at <b>Lime Kiln Park</b> and was able to photograph the <b>J Pod</b> orcas on Friday, twice on Saturday, and again on Sunday. On Saturday, they went north and then came back later that day. I was so glad I stayed as little J45 was practicing his breaching for a good half hour.

We had a great encounter with <b>J pod</b> today. We travelled quite far south of Vancouver towards the Juan de Fuca Straight and found <b>J pod not far off of Smith Island</b>. We found J14 with new calf J45 (see photo) and his siblings, including Big brother J30. We travelled back home along the west side of San Juan Island, where we saw J1 all by himself. He was quite far away from the rest of the pod, but we were happy to have a look at him and get away from the wind.

Just in from an exciting ride in Mark's Zodiac, <b>west of Race Rocks</b>, where we caught up with the <b>K13 family group of 6 whales</b>. Mark Malleson had spotted this group on an earlier trip. They were bucking a flood tide with 2-3ft chop at 2pm and moving fast. No time for foraging, although one seem to stall for a moment and possibly catch a fish or two. Plenty of white caps out there, near Church Rock, Sooke where we met up with them. Difficult to see these whales at times and to anticipate where they would surface due to the waves, but a great trip anyhow. We left them heading west still.

<b>J Pod with some K's</b> traveling north against an ebbing tide in Haro Strait from <b>1:15pm to 2:30pm</b>. The family groups were loosely spread out diving and foraging, then showed an array of behaviors as they closed in on Stuart Island; fluke and pectoral slaps, a few breaches, lunges, and flashes of male parts! (It'll be interesting to see if there are any new calves, in about a year and a half, from those K-13/ K-20 girls!!)

Today we came across <b>J Pod</b> in <b>Haro Strait</b> headed north toward Stuart Island at <b>1:30 p.m</b>. We watched <b>Granny (J-2) and Ruffles (J-1)</b> as they headed up the pod working their way north. The whales were in sub pod family groups, with lots of tail slapping going on, some foraging, and lots of traveling behavior. Big brother, <b>Riptide (J-30)</b> was right with his new sibling J-14's new calf. It was a beautiful day on the water with the added bonus of sunshine and warm temperatures. We left J pod as they headed north past Turn Point on Stuart Island, at <b>2:40 p.m</b>.

A <b>Gray </b>was sighted feeding at <b>West Beach (Deception Pass State Park</b>), I observed it <b>feeding South to North</b>, from our concession building all the way to W. Point (right at the Pass.) I observed from <b>4- 5pm</b>. It was originally reported by a visitor as an injured whale "Not moving, bobbing in the water for over an hour". It was in shallow water - less than 100ft from shore rolling to feed-no apparent injuries or abnormal behavior. Anecdotal reports later said it has been in the area for several days.

After I missed the J pod again, I still started listening at the <b>OrcaSound hydrophones</b> last night. It seemes succesfull, because arount 1 am (<b>4pm PST</b>) I heard them!

I got a call that <b>J-Pod</b> had slowly made it's way past <b>Kellett Bluff</b> (they were at False Bay early this morning, so they were definitely not in any sort of hurry! With only 2 boats within 10 miles of whales, it was very serene as the whales slowly meandered by. We saw <b>J17 </b>and new calf <b>J44</b>, as well as <b>J30 </b>Riptide doing very long dives. Even <b>J1 </b>Ruffles was easy to spot in the flat calm water well over a mile away! Blows would carry so far across the water that many times we'd hear the blow and turn to look for the whale and only see a footprint on the water.

<br/>Hi, after telling a friend I spent some time with a <b>Gray whale</b> just off the beach on the east side of Marrowstone Isl. she passed this site along to me. I was kayaking south along the shore and noticed the spout. I observed the whale feeding in about 6 to 8 feet of water just north off Liplip point. I hung out for about 20 min. then proceeded around to the south west side of the island. On my return a couple hours later, The whale or, a gray whale surfaced 100 feet to my right and I paddled along with it until I reached east beach.

We live on <b>south Camano</b>, and for the last few days one to <b>two gray whales</b> have been cruising by our home on Gull Way in the late afternoon regularly. On May 16th, Saturday, we witnessed a very upsetting occurrence with a boat interfering with two whales' progress. 
<br/>*<br/>
We were on the road to <b>lime kiln</b> around <b>6:45 pm</b> and saw the two adult whales, but we saw three babies. Two were still small, and one was very tiny, smaller than the two. It looks like it was <b>J pod, J44 and J45</b>, but who was that small-small one? It almost looked like a porpoise, and if we didn't hear it's exhalation, we thought it just might be. One of the bigger but still small babies, stayed near an adult. The other bigger small baby swam a little bit away, and the tiny one stayed with that one. And the other adult stayed in closer to shore?

There were T's everywhere out west in the<b> Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. They were seen 2-5 miles south and<b> west of Race Rocks</b>. I have never seen so many in one day. Such an awesome spectacle. The early afternoon trip at <b>12.15pm</b> caught up with playful Transients, possibly 10-12 that had probably just eaten. Their behaviour included several breaches and tail lobbing activity. T102, the big bull, was obvious on both the trips. His dorsal fin reminded me of 'Faith, 'L 57'. The later trip at <b>3.30pm</b>, saw most of the T's in separate groups, heading fast out west past Sheringham Lighthouse. There could have been 15-20 or more in total at that time. Mark Malleson our Expert on T's, here in Victoria, identified many of the groups seen in the Strait. <b>T100s.T124's T101's,T90's</b>.

Calls on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> - for a couple minutes then faded out beginning at <b>1748</b>, it's 1752 now.
Update at <b>8 pm: Still hearing calls</b>, squeeks, and what sounded like possible echolocation? (sounds like tapping on metal..) I think the echolocation was happening during what sounded like some blow hole burps, very low sounding squeeks (like a human with gas! hah) so was assuming they were possibly hunting some fish/prey? It went on and off for about 30-40 minutes, never really fading out, staying in the same area and very clear. The echolocation was very loud. A little bit after 1900, for about a half hour, and now I'm getting ALOT of noise of squeeks, and squeals and calls!!! It's not extremely loud, but it's very audible. I started listening at 1738, got calls at 1748 and continued until now (<b>2000</b>), and we are <b>still getting them</b>. More the squeeks and squeals this time. Sounds like several, rather than a few? I'm just learning the hydrophone listening.

<b>J pod</b> went south past Landbank between <b>5:20pm and 5:50pm</b>, traveling slowly and widely spread on glassy water. When we returned from a tasty and fun Whale Museum Greeting Ceremony benefit dinner (a big thank you to all those who worked so hard to put this event on), <b>J16 </b>and her family were hanging out at <b>Landbank </b>at about <b>9pm</b>, heading south but being pushed by the flood tide north. The "whoosh," "whoosh's" were loud and magical. After staying in the same hundred yards or so for at least a half hour, J16 and family picked up speed and began traveling south. It was getting pretty dark by this time. Almost as soon as the J16's moved south, J27 and his siblings appeared, whoosh, whooshing and moving south. Three whales came within 10 yards of shore, Ruffles (J1) and Granny (J2) and another whale that I could not identify by sight, but that had a familiar whistle--must be Speiden (J8) I'm thinking. Ruffles' exhalations in such still air exploded in the night. As I wrote this, faint calls at the LimeKiln hydrophones were becoming louder, but after boat noise came and went, the calls have disappeared, at least for now.

<b>7 orcas</b> for sure, but there seemed to be more -maybe 8 or 9, between <b>8:00 pm and 8:45 pm,</b> travelling south close in to the shore along south eastern <b>Vancouver Island</b>, from Porter's Creek estuary (south of Ladysmith which is south of Nanaimo), down and across the mouth of Chemainus Harbour , close in around Bare point, and then directly over to the northern end of the Shoal Islands off the Chemainus River estuary where they stopped for quite some time. Likely feeding - Moving quickly, then slowing to circle, diving, jumping occasionally, tail splashing . Settled at tide line off northern shoal islands for 20 mins. and may have stayed longer but we left.
Two very large fins led the group, out front about 300 feet. One was larger than the other and led slightly in front. Then a third whale joined them at times. Also in the following group whales amongst the smaller fins there was one very small (about 6' long) whale.

Amazing <b>day with T's</b> today. Dave Ellifrit was also there representing the Center for Whale Resarch, so I'm sure you will get a fantastic report from him too. When our boats passed close, he was just grinning from ear to ear and rattling off ID's. I think he was in T heaven!
A group of <b>approx 8 Transient Orca</b>s was located on the east side of Prevost Island at approx <b>12:30</b> today. <b>T102 </b>was clearly recognizable in the group, along with several females and juveniles. They were travelling at about 8 knots, heading south. Then, off a ways to the south there were many more blows spotted. We had heard that J Pod was headed North, and the immediate reaction was that we were going to have a near pass of Resident and Transient Orcas. As we approached, the pointy tips of the dorsal fins, and the unmistakable lean of T19B's fin revealed there were even more T's in the area. I can't give you an exact count of the number as the various groups kept joining up, then seperating, but I would estimate there were <b>about 20 whales</b> altogether. The whales we ID'ed on scene and after the fact from photos were the T18's, T20 &amp; T21, T100's, T101's and the T124's. A photo of T124D and company travelling together is attached. The Center for Whale Research was also on scene, so I am positive they will have a complete list of the whales that were present. We did see one kill during the time we spent with the T's - likely a seal as there was not much fuss at the surface, except for the seagulls looking for scraps. There was some social activity, some breaches and tailslaps, however, no vocals were heard. When we left the whales, most of the group was headed southwest, along the south side of Saltspring Island. What a magnificent show of power to have so many T's travelling together.

I took another trip Friday on the Ocean Magic at <b>3.30pm</b>, and conditions were even better than in the morning. Flat calm waters in Haro Strait with no wind. We encountered <b>T123's </b>and their tiny calf. Also the <b>T2's </b>that were with the T123's. The research boat monitoring them at the time gave me the info as to who we were watching. We had encountered the T's <b>west of Kelp Reef at 4.30 pm</b> and they were heading south in <b>Haro Strait</b>.

A lovely, calm, sunny day on the water! From about <b>1:15pm to 2:15pm</b>, we watched <b>J-Pod</b> very slowly swimming north across <b>Open Bay, off of San Juan Island</b>, against the ebbing tide. They were bunched up into 2 close, tight groups. A beautiful sight to see all those fins coming up together and one after another, with glimpses of <b>J-44 &amp; J-45</b> tucked in the middle. Their yellowy- orangey patches really stand out! The Orcas seemed to be resting, almost treading water in the same area for quite awhile, then there was some tail lobbing from a few trailing whales and a surprise flash of a "pink floyd"! Reports were of <b>a few of K-Pod with J-Pod</b>. At about 2pm they seemed to wake up, changed direction heading fairly fast south, then they all dove for a few minutes, came up, turned back north, picking up speed as they swam toward Stuart Island. I can only imagine the 'conversation' that took place in deciding the directional changes! Lots of rotund harbor seals sharing space with 3 adult &amp; 2 young eagles- feeding on a fish- on Sentinel Rocks, further awing our visitors with the diversity of wildlife that call the Salish Sea home!

We encountered <b>J pod</b> in resting formation off <b>Kellett Bluff, Henry Island</b> at <b>12 noon</b>. They were really bunched up together which was amazing to see. They headed slowly north against an ebbing tide. Conditions were fantastic. Saw Ruffles and Granny.

<br/>*<br/>
We arrived on scene <b>between Henry and Stuart Island around 1:40 pm</b> to find what appeared to be all of <b>J pod</b> moving in one tight knit group and travelling in a resting pattern. The group moved slowly along. They had no particular destination in mind, switching directions at will. Distinct members of the pod, like - <b>J26 (Mike), J27 (Blackberry), J1 (Ruffles), the two babies (!), and J30 (Riptide)</b>, swam amongst the pod. J pod also made the viewing pleasant because of their slow travel and tight knit group.

The following photos (see above) were taken near Flores Island, Clayoquot Sound. We encountered the same whale on two different occasionsand is easily recognized by the local tour boat captains as a regular summer <b>resident grey whale</b> though its light coloured head and unique markings. There were other grey whales in the large outer swells and foraging in the bays off the west coast of the island but this individual seemed to prefer the more sheltered east and south sides that day.

This morning between <b>8:30 and 9:30 AM</b>, two <b>gray whales</b> came from the NW feeding in the shallow water NW of <b>Langley</b>. One of the whales was clearly Patch (#49) and I'm not sure about the ID of the second whale. The whales worked their way back and forth and then headed out towards Camano.
Update at 1:50 pm: 1 Gray whale mid- channel in Saratoga Passage, off NW Langley heading NW.

<br/>*<br/>
We left the dock at Snug at 11:00 AM since both Jeanne and Jeff Hogan had seen members of <b>J Pod</b> on the West Side of SJI. Alas, they headed into big seas south of Discovery Is. and no one could find them. We came back in at 1:30, and I proceeded to go to Hannah Hts. to look for them. Jeanne began to hear them, but I still couldn't see them. By around 3:30 or so, they appeared at Lime Kiln headed north. We got everyone back onto the boat and by <b>4:00</b> the leaders were almost to <b>Henry Is.</b> still going N. Ken Balcomb and David Ellifrit came out and took pictures. We left them at 5:30, with Ken and Dave still on scene, still headed N toward Turn Pt. I didn't see all the Js, but I think other boats did, including J1 and J2. There were some <b>Ks</b> with them still.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island

After I received message that orca's were heading west, I started listening to the <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophone</b> - and waiting and patience paid off! Right now, <b>2:38 pm</b> - very faint calls but definetely southern residents! Then an update at 4:08 pm: About 1.5 hour ago I heard faint calls at the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Just now, since a few minutes, really clear calls at the OrcaSound hydrophone.
<br/>Jette, the Netherlands
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>4 pm</b> we heard some strange and faint whistles on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> - then ship noise drowned them out. Didn't sound like the usual <b>J pod</b> calls, but they were pretty faint and hard to detect.

This morning our vessel "Fastcat" was half way between Race Rocks and Crescent Bay when Marine Naturalist, Rachel, spotted a large dorsal fin in the distance. We slowed down and after a few more surfacings soon realized we had found <b>T14 </b>"Pender". During the 30 minutes we observed T14 he was zig-zagging across Juan De Fuca Strait and then suddenly made a number of sharp direction changes, possibly making a kill underwater of one of the Harbor Porpoise we had also seen in the area. We continued to <b>Crescent Bay</b> where we found a lone <b>Gray Whale</b> in resting mode logging at the surface. Yesterday, we also sighted a large Gray Whale a couple of miles south of Trial Island.

We observed <b>J pod</b> making only clicks for almost 1.5 hours as they traveled northwestward from between <b>Matia and Orcas Islands</b>. Then they began milling and whistling intensely. They were again traveling northward slowly when we left them at 6 pm. Maybe listen to Orcasound tonight as they occasionally seemed to travel towards Boundary Pass.
<br/>Beam Reach students onboard the Gato Verde 
<br/>*<br/>
Their dorsal fins and exhalations came into view just south of <b>Lummi Rocks</b>. We slowly approached seeing the tall dorsal with the unmistakable wavy trailing edge belonging to none other than Ruffles! Quickly I began searching out Granny and it was no surprise that Ruffles was being a "good son" on this beautiful Mother's Day staying very close to 
<b>J2</b>. Then a flash of the most beautiful orange caught my eye- it was little J45 surfacing by Samish and surrounded by the rest of their family (see photo on <a href="/images/photopage2009.html">Orca Network's Photo Page</a>)! I can't describe just how amazed I was to see the growth the youngster has gone through in the past few months. 11 year old Doublestuff (J34) is really coming into his own as well as Riptide (<b>J30</b>). Not to mention seeing Echo (<b>J42</b>) in contrast to the newest members of <b>J Pod</b>, to think she was that small only 2 years ago! I was able to identify a handful of K Pod whales that were amongst J Pod (Spock K20, Comet K38, and Scoter K25). There were others, but I was unable to get clear photos for identification.

This is the first really good ID photograph of any of the whales that have been feeding off <b>West Beach</b>, NW Whidbey Island. This is a new &amp; unusual place for us to have continual reports of <b>gray whales</b> feeding, and this ID shot will hopefully enable Cascadia Research to check their ID catalogs to see if it's one of the "regular" N. Puget Sound whales, or a newcomer that has found a new place to feed.
<br/>*<br/>
Not sure if this is a Gray or a Humpback (from the photos it is definitely a <b>gray</b>). I watched it feed for about an hour about 200 yards off Whidbey Island at Swan Lake at <b>West Beach</b>. It was moving back and forth parallel to the shore. This is the second time I've seen it there. Maybe you are able to recognize it by the coloring (see above photo &amp; comment). Love your site.

At <b>2:30 </b>today a <b>gray whale</b> passed by at <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b>, traveling north. The whale was following/hugging the shoreline. As the whale passed by the light he/she went into the cove continuing north. I went up to Andrews Bay to see if I could spot the whale.The whale was still following/hugging the shoreline all the way through Andrews Bay, surfacing about at four different locations as he/she traveled on to the north. The last surfacing was just out of my sight - I only heard the blow. Very unusual for Haro Strait.

After a brief visit with some <b>Dall's Porpoises</b> in the middle of the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, we encountered <b>J Pod</b> a little further south, shortly <b>before noon</b>, with flat calm conditions. The pod was spread out over miles, and were travelling slowly southeast in matriline groups. Our boat first encountered the J2 Matriline, with new calf J45. It was thrilling to see J Pod again after a long winter, and even better to see that all the whales look fat and healthy. It warmed my heart to see Granny take a turn at babysitting the little one - photo attached (see above - aaaww!) (zoomed and cropped). We also had an opportunity to visit with the J17 group (Princess Angeline and family). Little J44 seems to be quite the explorer, often swimming ahead of the remainder of the family, and showing off some fine tail slaps as well. We were fortunate to also encounter J16 and family after our visit with gray whales. This group was the furthest east, and were just rounding the tip of Point Roberts, travelling in about 10 feet of water, heading towards Boundary Bay. For all the distance that the pod was spread, we heard no vocals on the hydrophone, just some echolocation clicks.

I saw <b>Orcas</b>!! I was fishing for rockfish in my kayak off <b>Cherry Point</b> just south of Point Whithorn. At like <b>6.30</b> or so I heard what I thought to be a whale exhale Like 10 minutes later I hear it again and realize it really is something. Look around and sure enough a top fin of a killer whale goes up and down like 250 yards away! Then I realize there are like 3 or 4!! The others are spread way out, it amazed me how far apart they were. They were all traveling south parallel with the coast heading toward Sandy Point only like 1/4 mile past the refinery docks. Watched for like 15 minutes as they moved south, slowly. Definitely traveling. Go back to fishing and out of nowhere a whale surfaces like 125 yards in front of me! Right in front of the refinery dock! He was traveling too, parallel with the coast. On his 3rd rise he turns right at me!!!!! His next rise right at me!!!! I freaked out. This giant, intelligent creature oriented it's self toward me. I thought he would come right under me and was I scared, he probably felt that cuz he didn't surface again till he was like 100 yards away back on the southern course. He then did like 4 circles nice and slow then I didn't see him again. It was weird, he didn't rise and I was looking. Then saw the biggest fin by far heading south was out there. He was far but I could still tell it was the biggest. It was special. No one to share it with but you so thanks.

There are still four <b>Gray Whales</b> in <b>Boundary Bay</b>. Three of the animals we observed today have been there since at least the middle of April, and at least one also visited Boundary Bay in 2007.

A whale seen at <b>7:30 pm</b> outside our home by the Harstene Island bridge (S. Puget Sound). Was a surprise - saw the water blow and the whale surface. All I could see was a top fin I think. He then proceeded farther toward the bridge and out of view surfacing to blow but not out of the water as far as he had. Would love if you could tell me what type it might be?

Between <b>5:00 PM and 6:00 PM</b>. We had a <b>gray whale</b> that stayed northwest of <b>Langley </b>for over an hour! The whale would roll on to it's side and feed for a dozen or so times, head out to deeper water and loop back for more feeding. I was unable to ID the whale but forwarded on some of the pics I took. Also took some shots of a kayaker who drifted in a little close, but then headed off. The whale was unperturbed. While I was photographing that whale, I spotted another gray whale heading to Camano, diving deep and showing its flukes. At 7:30 PM the same gray whale has returned, traveling from SE to NW, Continuing to feed close to shore.

At 1:00pm on the beach between <b>Bells Beach and Eastpoint</b> we heard a blow. There was a lone <b>Grey </b>traveling very slowly parallel to the beach headed towards Eastpoint. I was a bit concerned because he was no more than 15-20' off shore in very shallow water. He was rolling often and popped his head out to look at us a couple times as we followed him for about a mile. When he rolled it appeared to me that his right fluke had been either worn down or sheered on the end. He was around 35' long with lots of barnacles on him. When we got to the point at #3 past the spit where the water depth drops off we lost sight of him as he seemed to be headed towards Holmes Harbor.

At <b>4:19 p.m.</b> Center staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and guest John Boyd responded to a report of <b>Transients </b>off <b>Kelp Reef</b> as well as<b> J pod</b> off the South end of San Juan Island. The <b>T71's </b>(T71, T71A and T71B) and <b>T40 </b>were encountered at <b>4:33 p.m.</b> just north of <b>Kelp Reef</b> (48° 33.15 N, 123° 13.54 W). The whales were actively hunting a Steller Sea Lion. The transients continued to attack the sea lion for about an hour. The sea lion was determined to have been killed around 6:00 p.m. At 6:21 the encounter ended and the transients continued traveling slowly north at (48° 34.39 N, 123° 13.48 W).

Best I have had at the dog house (downtown <b>Langley</b>) in some time. <b>Patch </b>and his friend spent about 15-20 minutes just lollygagging about 150 meters from shore, showing their entire bodies and slowly rolling along almost like a chorus line.

<b>Transients </b>were between <b>Discovery &amp; San Juan Islands</b> heading north. After watching the Transients, we decided to head down towards <b>False Bay</b> to see <b>J-Pod</b>. We did manage to spot J17 and new calf J44, along with J16, J26, J27, J41.The Residents were quite spread out over several miles and were meandering slowly towards the southeast. I had the opportunity to go out and see "Captain Hook" (<b>T40</b>) and the other <b>transients</b>, and witness a rare interaction between the Transients &amp; a Steller Sea Lion. The 5 transients spent over an hour and a half toying with the sea lion, occasionally letting it "get away" before they'd lunge after it. The two younger whales were obviously practicing their techniques, and we kept wondering if they were just toying with the sea lion or if they'd really eat it. Finally, after 90 minutes of this behavior, they decided to eat and the steller was pulled below the surface and all five orcas disappeared for several minutes. When they returned to the surface, there was no sign of the sea lion.

Got a call from Shane about a report of <b>orcas </b>in the south end of <b>Bellingham Channel</b> headed south. Went upstairs to the scope and saw at least three groupings of orcas cruising past Fidalgo Head toward Burrows Island lighthouse in Rosario Strait. Saw Ruffles and two other sprouted males, a tiny babe, and some activity: spy hops, tummy-up tail lobs and pec fin slaps. They were going at a pretty good clip, I'm guessing with the ebb tide.

He was out boating and diving in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, and around noon came across a whale in about 10' of water off <b>Baby Island</b>. He has been watching the Gray whales (and is a marine biologist), but said this was not a Gray - it was <b>creamy white in color, ~20' long, no dorsal fin, and a single blow-hole</b> (Grays &amp; all baleen whales have 2 blow holes). The whale swam close around their boat, nearly touching the swim step, so they got a good look at it, but unfortunately no photos. It would spout every 60 - 70 seconds. The only marine mammal that comes close to this description is a Beluga whale, which is not found in these waters.

I left <b>J pod</b> and, at least, the <b>K13's</b> at <b>2030 </b>heading north at <b>Lime Kiln</b> spread out in small groups. The whales were too spread out and I didn't have enough light to find everybody but both calves were looking good and I saw K13, K25, K27, and K34 mixed in with the J's. 
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
I got my first good look at the whales this year. It was so good to see<b> J pod</b> all afternoon, then listen to them most the night, barring ship noise. I saw both of the newest calves, J44 and J45 for the first time. Both were romping around, tail slapping, bouncing, and turning and twisting on the surface. J44 practiced his/her swan dives frequently and spent a lot of time close to J28, with J17 and J35 sticking fairly close. They joined with J8, J27, J31, J39, J19 and J41 and spent some time socializing and "foraging" as a group at Hannah Heights before moving north at around 4p.m. and continuing to "forage". All the orcas stalled out for awhile, with the northernmost whales at Lime Kiln, the southernmost off Land Bank, and J1, J2 and reportedly the J16's about 1-2 miles offshore. At about 4:45pm they headed south again. This time I got a photo of K20. (I thought there were too many whales to be just J pod. Later I learned that the K13's had been spotted by others.) During the time I watched the whales (about <b>2pm to 6:30pm</b>) they seemed to be not in the constant search for food/traveling mode that was so prevalent last year, but more relaxed and less purposeful. There was lots of social activity and lots of hanging out. Hope this continues. I also saw my first sea snake of the year-either J27 or J30, but couldn't accurately identify b/c they were traveling together and I couldn't find an ID catalog for this body part.

<b>J-Pod</b> is absent no longer!!! After 44 days, J-Pod made a special appearance on the west side of San Juan! Luckily The whales were spread out from one side of Haro Strait to the other, and they would speed up for awhile, and then take their time and zig-zag around randomly (well, it appears random to us on the surface.) After hearing about new babies all these weeks, I was finally able to see with my own eyes J14 and her new calf J45! He's (well, we'll use artistic license and say "he") sure was active as he'd surface so exuberantly! We also spotted J1 Ruffles off in the distance (about half a mile away and still so recognizable!) J30 is surely sprouting big time and it was so good to see everyone once again. I heard from Jeanne Hyde that K20 had been spotted earlier in the day, but we only saw J's in the afternoon.

Wow this whale was so exciting to watch I couldn't get any decent photos. The whale was spotted off W Seattle (south of Fauntleroy) and heading north, fast. My neighbors and I saw 2-3 full breaches. Seemed to be only one solo whale. I'm sure it was a humpback because of the very long pectoral fins I saw when it breached. It was half-way out in the sound so too far to get any close up shots. Hope other get so it this whale in action.

Been watching <b>two grays</b> on Friday and Saturday-off bluff at Fort Nugent and <b>West Beach</b>. Close to shore at times, seem to be eating in a pattern and staying close together. One seems much larger than the other.

We received a call from a woman who was watching a <b>Gray whale</b> in south <b>Saratoga Passage</b> at <b>1:45 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from David Moses, who was watching a <b>Gray whale</b> about 1/2 mile off <b>Priest Pt</b>, near Tulalip, WA for 2.5 hours in the same exact spot. It seemed to be on its side, and then its head or fluke would come up, but it never changed direction or moved from the spot it was in as he watched it from <b>9:30 - noon</b>. He was concerned as the tide was starting to go out and it was in a shallow area, but at <b>12:30</b> he called back to say the whale had finally moved and was breathing and swimming normally. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Morning</b>, at least <b>two grays</b> still here. <b>4:00 pm</b>, <b>three grays</b> just passed by <b>Kayak Point</b> close to shore moving north.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Pt., WA 
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>gray whales</b> were seen in <b>Elger bay</b> Camano Island Wa. They were seen around <b>9:45 a.m</b>. They were coming up and out of the water. They stayed around for about 30 minutes, then headed south.

<b>Two grays</b> dropped into the <b>Elger Bay</b> "restuarant" this morning for a "snack." I watched them from about <b>9:00 to 9:30</b> or so.
<br/>Peter DeLuca, Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
I had the pleasure of watching <b>2 gray whales</b> feeding in the shallows at <b>Mabana </b>(SW Camano Isl) about<b> 6:30 AM</b>.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island

One great <b>Gray</b>. (feeding between <b>Baby Island</b> and the green buoy.)
