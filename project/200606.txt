<b>June 30, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Brad Hanson called to report that he &amp; Candi Emmons had found the pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> off Vashon Island Friday evening - they saw 5 of the 6 that were present in the pod earlier in the week (apparently there were 2 males present in earlier sightings, but 1 of the males was being stealthy.....). They left them off south Vashon Island, heading south. 
<br/>*<br/>
Early this morning we had <b>J's &amp; L's</b> in mid-channel of Haro Strait. <b>K's</b> were still up north after they left yesterday afternoon. Later in the day, they were still at Andrews Bay. But when we came on scene in the afternoon, we only saw L's on the west side.  Later, around <b>3:00</b>, we heard that another boat had discovered what he believed to be J-Pod up near Java Rocks in Boundary Pass. They must have given everyone the slip when L's decided to head South. Near False Bay, we had a wonderful float watching the L's forage for salmon---and they were really vocalizing in the process. L-41 Mega was doing long dives, and gave us quite a start by coming up when no one knew he was even around!  We left the whales still heading slowly towards Cattle Point, spread out in a path about 3 miles long and 1-2 miles wide.

Kathlyn Rice called at <b>7:20 pm</b> to report the pod of <b>orcas </b>in Colvos Passage, heading south past Prospect Pt, 1/4 mile north of Olalla Bay.
<br/>*<br/>
Josh Gillanders on the Goodtime II called at <b>5:30 pm</b> to report 3 - 5 <b>orcas </b>feeding off the Blake Island Jetty, heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
Trey Walker called to say the Seattle-Bainbridge ferry announced seeing <b>orcas </b>at <b>4:15 pm</b>, closer to the Bainbridge side.

June 28/29 - A report from Southern California three miles offshore of Dana Point. We've had seven <b>Blue whales</b> for the last two days. Water temp has been fluctuating between 59 degrees to 70 degrees and now back to 59 degrees in the last ten days. The Blues are adults ranging from seventy to one hundred feet. Lots of huge flukes in the air and much reddish excrement in the water, so apparently they are feeding. Four to seven blows, then down for six to ten minutes. Spouts of fifteen feet or more. We are going out daily and hope they stay for a while. Yesterday (6/29) we also had common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and Risso's dolphins all in the same general area.

I am always in awe of the beauty and peacefulness of these wonderful (<b>Orca </b>whales) when we encounter them on our trips. We left the dock today with <b>J pod</b> at Colville coming West and <b>L pod</b> milling near Lime Kiln, where they had been since this morning. We ended up finding J pod off of Iceberg Point, where they had slowed down and were doing some foraging. We got a wonderful look at J19 and J41, as well as J1, L57 and others. We watched for a while as they glided by us through the calm water. We were just getting ready to start heading back to Friday Harbor when I heard a boat with L pod say they were porpoising towards us from off Eagle Point.  Just at about the same time I noticed the whales we were watching begin to porpoise towards L pod. We traveled offshore of J pod until they reached Salmon Bank. Then the L pod fins started appearing from the other direction as we were treated to a couple of great breaches.  I set up, with a couple of other boats, offshore of the whales at about 300 yards, shut down, and put the hydrophone in. The symphony of vocalizations were spectacular. Their level of communication always amazes me. We started to see them group up; 5 whales, 10 whales, 20 whales at a time and then split off into smaller groups, only to come back together, going every direction. Before we could relocate, we found ourselves with whales all around us. They were everywhere, frolicking in tight groups of 10 to 15 whales. I try not to apply human emotions to these beautiful animals. But I have to say that they just seemed so happy, peaceful, and affectionate towards each other.
We had been with them for about 15 minutes or so when the flood tide began sucking us and another boat (Olympus) towards Cattle Pass. Every time I was getting ready to start my engines whales would pop up nearby, still socializing with each other. Next thing I know Olympus and I are drifting through Cattle Pass at 5.5 Kts and the whales are staying right with us. It was amazing to see them so effortlessly navigate through the roaring current as we bobbed and spun like corks on the surface. Finally, about 2 miles up San Juan Channel the whales started to group up in the middle and we started to drift to the East side. As I brought the boat around and headed home we could still see them breaching and socializing, as if they hadn't a care in the world. These animals are truly special. Lets all keep doing all that we can to protect their environment and keep them around for a long time to come.

<b>Orcas </b>seemed to be all over the straits today! I was kayaking near Swirl Island and about 12 went by me there, 2 adult males, several females and one very small one. They were heading towards the south west at a good pace, no breaching or other action just cruising. There seemed to be plenty more (from what I could see and hear) to the west and south in the straits, along with several boats, also scattered.

Today we had the good fortune to have <b>ALL 3 Pods</b> in San Juan waters! This morning, a majority of K's and L's were hanging out in the currents near Lime Kiln. They were foraging, breaching, and generally moving in random patterns. Later in the day, K Pod decided to head "up island" and went towards Turn Point Lighthouse and beyond, while the L's continued to forage, rest, and play at Lime Kiln. As we left the dock, a report of J's coming down Rosario got the crew excited, but with J's pretty far in Rosario and L's reported to be heading North, we weren't too expectant of the two meeting up. I got the chance to witness first-hand my very first <b>Greeting Ceremony!</b>  As if practicing for the J's that were coming from Iceberg towards Cattle Point, a large group of L's broke into two groups, and began staying on the surface in two distinct lines. They slowly moved towards each other, and the vocalizations underwater were astounding. But if you didn't have a hydrophone, it didn't matter, for when the whales got about 10-15 yards from each other, the surface vocalizations became amazing. I was truly humbled by this incredible display. Then the whales dove down, and we couldn't figure out where they went until they decided to show off and do some incredible breaching--males coming fully out of the water! Then most of the group high-tailed it easterly to greet the J's that were now almost to the entrance of Cattle Pass.

Our first trip took us to the west side of San Juan Island near Lime Kiln State Park at about <b>2-3pm</b>. <b>L pod and K pod</b> were all together putting on quite a scene. Breaches, spyhops, tail-lobs. Our second trip was even better... <b>all 3 pods</b> were making their way up San Juan Channel as we left Friday Harbor. In the south part of Griffin Bay, all 3 pods were spread out everywhere with a similar scene. Breaching, spy hops, and tons of tail slaps. We saw some mating as well.. lots of dual tail action going on. We even saw a few sea snakes!

Karl at Alki Pt. reported the pod of <b>orcas </b>heading south past the south edge of Alki Pt. heading toward Lincoln Park <b>between 9:10 &amp; 9:30 pm</b>. 1 male, 4 females &amp; 1 juvenile. 
<br/>*<br/>
Josh Gillanders on the Goodtime 2/Argossy Cruises called to report the pod of <b>orcas </b>at a little after <b>8 pm</b>. They had been sighted by 2 of the Argossy boats off Westpoint &amp; the Tango Buoy NW of Alki Pt, still heading south. More details from Washington State Ferries about the pod were that 1 adult male &amp; a calf were present in the pod.
<br/>*<br/>
It was Big Dorsal day on the West side (San Juan Isl)  with <b>J’s &amp; L’s</b> swimming together. First encounter was up just South of Lime Kiln at about <b>2PM</b>. The whales heading North went by. About a half an hour later I looked up and the whales that had passed by earlier were headed South again! As usual, Ruffles &amp; Granny seemed to be the leaders. As I continued North I looked back and here came L57 with two females, one on each side heading North again! It was amazing- whales back and forth heading every which way. Some were foraging off shore and some just seemed to be milling. There were a couple of tail slaps and one female breached twice! It was just fabulous, with a calm glassy Haro Straight and sunshine to boot!!!

Received a call from Capt. Tim McGuire of Wash. State Ferries, reporting a pod of 6 - 7 <b>orcas </b>with a calf, ~ 3/4 - 1 mile off Kingston, WA in the southbound lanes, heading south, at <b>4:40 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported they had <b>J's</b> earlier in the day off  the west side of San Juan Island, then as we were talking on the phone at <b>5:40 pm</b> he said the whales were coming back by the Center again -

<b>J's</b> with <b>L57 </b>spread out along the west side of San Juan Island (south of Lime Kiln) this <b>morning/noon</b>. L57 was hanging out with a few females inshore and east of the rest; very active foraging, and a few rather amorous moments.

Once again, <b>L-57</b> was still traveling with the females of <b>J-Pod</b> as they headed up mid-channel of Haro Strait towards Turn Point at <b>3:00 PM</b>. Today he was sighted in close company with J-28 Polaris, who is herself coming "of age". There were several other females as well traveling near him too.  J-1 Ruffles was traveling by himself when he passed by, with J-2 Granny not too terrible far behind. J-22 Oreo was traveling with her youngsters, Oreo and Doublestuff off to the east of the main group as well.

<b>L57 </b>has been hanging around with <b>J pod</b> the last few days, and it looks to us like a "dating opportunity" as one of our passengers so aptly put it. We have observed him in close company with a few females, and much rolling around behaviors, both male and female - and the summer "sea snake" has also been observed on a few occasions. We may even have pictures to prove it. We had what looked kind of like a "group grope" this morning on our trip, with L57, a couple of females, and a couple of youngsters. The young ones spyhopped a few times. Then they joined up with the rest of J pod who were approaching in resting formation.....verrry interesting....

<b>J's</b> with <b>L57 </b>"sleeping" at Open Bay as of <b>11am</b>. The first report of them at Open Bay was received around 9am, so it seems they hung out there for quite some time.

Around <b>11:45</b>, we heard on the radio that <b>J-Pod</b> had decided to really move across Georgia Strait and was making a beeline for Eastpoint at about 10 knots. So we headed up Boundary and found them about 1 mile east of Eastpoint, and boy were they in a mood to play!  Multiple breaches, spyhops, and probably the most amazing cartwheel I've ever seen (so energetic the whale came completely out of the water!) For the afternoon trip, J's were still in Boundary Pass, having slowed up considerably. As they made the turn at Turn Point, the whales got quite frisky again as they entered the "washing machine" of converging currents and went into multiple breach mode once again.  And it appears that L-57 is still hanging out with the J's as he was the only L-Pod whale we observed.

We watched a pod of 6-8 <b>Transients </b>off Race Rocks and heading North past Victoria this mid morning. There was one large male I have a temporary ID as T11A but will confirm after I send my photo to the Center later in the week. There were several females and or young males and one baby that looked like it was about a year or so old. At one point they were all grouped up and traveling tight – easily doing about 7-8 knots! Earlier reports were 8 whales and I have a photo that you can clearly ID 6 dorsals.

June 20 &amp; 24 - Richard Niemar called to report two sightings of a single <b>orca </b>(non-adult male) off Baja - the first sighting was June 20th at Cabo Pomo, the 2nd report was June 24th at Punta Arena.
<br/>*<br/>
We met up with <b>Jpod </b>and some <b>L's</b> in heading North in Rosario Strait just off Lummi Island. Thought we had only Jpod first, but thought some L's were in there and have a posititve ID for L57 Faith. I got my pics on Flickr if anyone is interested. 
http://www.flickr.com/photos/wildorcas/. The whales treated us to multiple spyhops, breaches, cartwheeling and some amazing tail lobs and a wonderful symphonie. They were still headed North as we left them at about <b>4.30 pm</b> or so.

[<b>Orcas</b>] on the west side of San Juan Island passing Low Island about <b>3:30 PM</b>. There were whales over in Rosario as well. Not sure what group was out today as they were a bit too far to ID, but they apparently didn't go far to the north as we had more whales (same guys?) passing the house about <b>6:00 PM</b> heading back south!

We were out on 2 trips today with 2 different groups of [<b>orcas</b>].  Our AM trip had us catching up to the trailers of <b>L Pod</b> as they headed from Alden Bank towards Rosario Pass. They were travelling leisurely with great vocals. One youngster treated us to a couple of back to back breaches. As we were preparing to leave, the group must have received some signal that they were lagging behind, as they started porpoising away, Southbound.
<br/>For the PM trip, we had received an update that the whales in Rosario Pass were headed back Northbound. We anticipated seeing L Pod whales again, but this time it was <b>J Pod</b> headed our way. We first met up with J1 &amp; J2, with the rest far behind. A few tail slaps from Granny later, and the rest of the pod was soon sighted heading North from the vicinity of Lummi Island. Again, they were quite spread out, but were in fine voice. We had a great show from several whales, but in particular J26. He seemed intent on showing off multiple behaviors - breaches, tail slaps, pec slaps, and a cartwheel or two. Meanwhile, another whale further in the distance was practising spy hops - 3 in a row!  We left J Pod headed Northbound towards Point Roberts at approx <b>4:30 PM</b>.

At <b>3:30</b> today, we saw a large number of <b>Orcas </b>swimming north quite close to Lummi Island when we were there to eat lunch at the Willows Inn, which looks out over the water. Many others were seeing them also, many other onlookers had binoculars, and were certain they were the orcas.

I do not understand the lack of <b>Lpod </b>Reports with the <b>J's</b>. I had them this morning off Colville Island at <b>1015 </b>and near Stuart Island at <b>1535</b>. No other whale looks like L57 and he was there, we are still missing some of Lpod.

We heard that <b>J's &amp; L's</b> were heading up the west side of San Juan Island, but as we watched the whales pass by near Pender Island around <b>3:00 PM</b>, we only saw J's.  As they came across Boundary Pass and headed into Swanson Channel, they began to gather closer to shore. Lots of percussives and breaches by the juveniles as they continued North.

We found <b>J Pod</b> today, headed north from Stuart lighthouse, Turn Point, across Boundary Pass....going toward N. Pender Island at <b>3:15 p.m.</b> J-1 Ruffles, and J-2 Granny at the head of the group, swimming steadily north.  Then as they got near North Pender island they slowed, and continued up the shore. J-8 passed by, J-26, and far inshore, many more.

<b>June 12 - 23 - Chito Pt, (west of Seiku, WA) gray whale sightings</b>
<br/>I will try to do a brief synopsis of gray whale sightings off Chito Point during that period.  My sightings have been limited due to my work schedule, however, a gray whale (I believe the same whale) has been observed feeding daily, spyhopping and even sleeping, in one specific area to the East of Chito Point, which is nearly seven miles west of Sekiu. This whale would remain in this one area for hours every day. I recorded on 6/12 - 6 hrs, 6/13 - 7 1/2 hrs., 6/14 - 3 1/2 hrs., 6/15 - 5 hrs., 6/16 - 3 hrs. These totals were from different sightings during those dates, however, the shortest feeding period was 2 hours, and the longest was 4 hours.
<br/>The long periods of feeding ended on 6/16 (from my observation log - remember I'm not always watching).  Since then, I've logged the following sightings:
<br/>6/17 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West, 6 pm
<br/>6/18 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading East, 4 pm
<br/>6/19 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West, 6 pm

<br/>6/23 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West, 3:30 pm
<br/>During the days of long feeding periods, many times I thought this whale had a lighter colored head than body.  It may be a large concentration of barnacles, however, this particular whale brought his head out of the water frequently on surfacing and spyhopping.  The head always appeared lighter in color, consistently.  On 6/19, the sighting at 6 pm of the Gray heading west, was this same whale, by the manner in which it surfaced, and binocular observation.

A Semi-Superpod traveling North up Swanson Channel. We had to really travel a long way to see our orca friends, and managed to catch the trailers about <b>3:30 PM</b> just entering into Active Pass. They were very active (no pun intended) as they came close to the entrance, with lots of breaches, pec slaps, and tail slaps. Once around the bend, the whales got into tighter groups.

We found <b>K Pod</b> this morning at <b>10:15</b> heading east in Spieden Channel. They were in several groups, one group swimming the shore of Spieden, and a larger group, with K-21, staying on the south side of the channel. The whales spent their time traveling, doing some foraging, a few tail slaps, breaches, and one grand spy hop. They went toward Jones Island, then Orcas, doing some long dives, and  
finally making the decision to head on to the east. The new baby was very energetic, with lots of fast swimming by mom. There were  
several other fins that looked a lot like sprouters!

We met up with <b>J-Pod</b> about 1.5 miles off shore of False Bay. J-1 was leading the pack towards Salmon Bank, with most of the J's spread out over a large distance. We were fortunate to see quite a few juveniles practicing their breaches, and had the rare treat of two spyhops back to back (my favorite whale behavior)!  Lots of evidence of foraging going on. Later, I noticed J's going by Low Island/San Juan County Park heading North. They were still traveling semi-spread, except for one tight group of 9 whales that was traveling in a quite slow pace.

4 <b>Transients </b>kill a harbor seal in San Juan channel between Lopez Is and Griffin Bay. Approx 1 mile North of cattle pass. at <b>12:30-1:30</b>. A harbor seal looked like it was going to haul out on the stern of the Odyssey. It was 10 feet from the boat as the 4 transients started a symmetrical weaving pattern. Back and forth crossing paths closer and closer to our stern. 35 eight graders from TOPS school in Seattle witnessed the wild kingdom in action when the T,s surrounded the seal 20 feet off our port stern. The mature female tail slapped and then juvenile did a rather feeble tail slap and they repeated tail slap practice for some time. When ever the seal started to swim away another of the larger T,s flicked it with their snout to toss it back in the middle of the circle. The T,s carried on like this for 20 minutes. Then they submerged with the seal and resurfaced minutes later and the seal was gone. The T's crossed back and forth under the boat 4 or 5 times, visible through the water, spouting several times each. They spy hoped twice off the bow and then continued a straight swim south towards Goose Is. in cattle pass off the S. end of San Juan Is.

About <b>2:30 - 4:30...  J pod</b>...alot of surface behavior... tail/pec slaps...  2 or 3 breaches...some logging maybe... they were just laying on the surface for a minute or two now and then...  I think I even heard a above water vocalization when one was poking his head up... not really a true spyhop though... maybe it was bubbles?  Sounded like gurgling though....? They were spread out alot... the leader was probably almost to South Beach area by the time the last group came around by Eagle. Boats were saying that J1 was WAY out.

<b>orca</b>(s) sighted this afternoon @ <b>1730</b>: 1 male, 1 female, 1 baby 1237 hwy 101 south, yachats, <b>oregon</b>. (near cape perpetua)  
orcas heading south toward sea lion caves... 
<br/>*<br/>
I have a sighting to report, witnessed by four adults.  We were too stunned by what we were seeing to get the camera and take it's picture at approximately <b>4:30 p.m</b>. One <b>orca</b>, probably male, with a large, tall, upright fin. Yachats, <b>Oregon</b>, just south of the mouth of the Yachats River, halfway between Newport and Florence. He was not very far offshore, about the same distance out as the gray whales that we see. The whale was traveling south at a pretty good speed. We saw him breach twice, then he disappeared for a few
minutes, and reappeared south of us, where he breached several more times, and continued to travel south.

Rod Johnson, a commercial fisherman out of Newport, <b>OR</b>, reported a pod of <b>orcas </b>approx. 10 miles off of Newport. The pod included 1 male plus 2 - 3 others - sounds like the same pod of Transients we've been hearing about lately. They were playing with a seal, he said it looked like they were teaching the young ones how to hunt.
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>J Pod</b> outside of Active Pass headed toward Pt. Roberts, tonight at <b>7:00 PM</b>.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's charters
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I was out with <b>J Pod</b> at about <b>3:30pm</b> off of Turn Point. They were broken up in several small groups with 3-5 members per group and  they were heading north. A younger animal turned upside down and gave us some nice looks at his pec fins and then started to slap his tail while upside down with his pecs sticking out.. very cute!
<br/>Traci, Naturalist on the Sea Hawk
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>5:45 pm</b> a small group (about 6-8) <b>orcas</b> went through Active Pass heading east. Travelled quickly,
some tail slapping.

About twenty <b>orcas </b>sighted at the 260 line right off the washington coast...from charterboat F/V "Hawk II", traveling south around <b>noon </b>today. they were very interested in seeing the boat (skipper kept away of course...we're all USCG vessels and very aware of laws) and "led" the way for a while as he headed south...."the one big male was leading the way..."

Ralph Shuping reported 8 or 9 <b>orcas </b>breaching &amp; playing off South Beach, south of Newport, <b>OR</b>. Location was 44.36  124.5
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orca </b>pod sighted at Point Roberts WA <b>6:30 - 7:00 pm</b> - approx 7 whales, 2 large dorsal fin males, One calf (with female) heading South. Feeding behaviour, harbour seals were close to shore and away from the orcas, so whales were probably feeding on salmon/other fish as the smelt are running. There was another whale blow, perhaps a Gray, heading North.
<br/>Sandra Scott 
<br/>*<br/>
Kevin of Marine Discovery Tours out of Newport, <b>OR </b>called to report 4 <b>orcas </b>heading into the Jetties at Newport, all the way up to the bridge, then back out about 1 - 2 miles offshore between <b>10 &amp; 11 am</b> this morning. There were 2 females, 1 adult male, &amp; 1 calf. He left them heading toward Depoe Bay. They've had some local <b>grays </b>in the area as well the past week or so.

We spent the afternoon with <b>J-Pod</b> once again! Today they were headed south in Rosario at <b>1:00 p.m</b>. with once again very relaxed traveling behavior, and occasional quick turns and dives. They were very spread out, with J-1 way across the strait. Both J-27 and J-26 were showing off their sprouting (and tall!) dorsals.  J-1 gave us the pleasure of a slow spy hop. Wow! By 2:40 they were starting to  
turn on a little steam, and grouping up heading for the south end of Lopez Island. The water was very flat today, with lots of low clouds, mist, and fog in the distance. Magical.

A <b>Gray </b>whale just passed Chito Point (seven miles west of Sekiu) at <b>4:15 pm</b>, directly outside the kelp bed, on a straight path heading towards Neah Bay.

We received a call at <b>12:30 pm</b> from the Whale Watching Center in Depoe Bay, OR, reporting 3 <b>orcas </b>in the bay today, for the 3rd day in a row. On May 30, the orcas were actively feeding, but not on the gray whales that were nearby.
<br/>*<br/>
Chris Iverson, a salmon fisherman, called to report at least 3 <b>orcas </b>in 250' of water 15 degrees south of the Pt. Arena buoy, <b>CA </b>at <b>9:30 am</b>. There was 1 large male, 1 med. whale with a notch in its fin, &amp; 1 calf. They had apparently just made a kill as there was blood &amp; clots in the water. 
<br/>*<br/>
Tom Lennons called to report <b>orcas </b>this <b>morning </b>off Pt. Arena, <b>CA </b>- he saw 3 small &amp; 1 large whale, at 
38 54.25 N 123  45.2 W.
