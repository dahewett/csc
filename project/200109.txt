<br/><b>Location:</b> West side of San Juan Island 
<br/><b>Species:</b> Orca 
<br/><b>Pod:</b> L Pod, K Pod, J Pod 
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> north
<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hi Susan, All 3 pods were back at the west side of San Juan again today, headed north. Lots of feeding and playing behaviour going on. There were close to 100 fishing boats right next to Lime Kiln so the whales were further out from shore, which made it a little nicer for the whale watchers. It was really nice to have them close to us in Everett but I know how hard it is for the others to reach them when they're down there. For everyone else's sake, I'm glad they're back up north. Cindy

<br/><b>Pod:</b> L Pod, K Pod, J Pod 
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b>
<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hi Susan, We got to spend a lot of time with the whales today. They led us down Admiralty Inlet and almost all the way back home. All 3 pods were present and accounted for with L12's lagging a little behind the others. We were the only boat with them for most of the time until they encountered the fishing boats, and they were very active and playful. We finally left them very spread out and foraging between Edmonds and Kingston. Hopefully they'll stay down here for a few days. It's great to have them closer to home! Cindy Hansen Mosquito Fleet

<br/><b>Reported by:</b> Susan Berta/Howard Garrett, Orca Conservancy

<br/><b>Species:</b> Orca 
<br/><b>Pod:</b> L Pod, K Pod, J Pod 
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> south
<br/><b>Comments:</b>We went to the west side of Whidbey, &amp; were able to see the whales just south of Double Bluff around noon. They were closer to the opposite shore, so impossible to make ID's or see them closely, but we saw at least one male, &amp; later at 12:15 as they were further south (across from Scatchet Head) there was lots of breaching &amp; tale lobs going on. We left them at 12:45 - across from Possession Pt, where they appeared to be very close to the opposite shore, still heading south.

<br/><b>Reported by:</b> Elsa Leavitt 
<br/><b>Location:</b> Bush Pt, West Whidbey Island 
<br/><b>Species:</b> Orca 
<br/><b>Pod:</b> , Southern Residents 
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> south
<br/><b>Comments:</b>I'm not an expert, but three distinct groups of orcas just passed Bush Point, heading south. First group had lots of whales, pretty spread out, hard to count--but well over 12, including one large male. Second group was a few minutes behind and contained perhaps 8-10 whales, one with a larger dorsal fin. Third group was another few minutes behind the second group and had even fewer whales. I was beginning to think they'd never come down this way, though I do know that they passed by here last October, heading south. --Elsa

The male had the largest dorsal I had ever seen (seemed to be two toned with black &amp; grey, from the field guide it looked like one of the large "L" pod males????), and mother &amp; calf were in the group as well. Heading towards Saturna Island. Best of all, not a boat in sight :-) Regards Derek Holzapfel

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Dear Susan I just saw at least 10 whales (or porpoise) swimming about headed from ledgewood beach area towards admirals cove. They were closer to shore than they have been in the past. it is hard to tell how close since I am so high on the hill, but this time they disappeared through the trees between me and the beach. It seems that every time I see them the waters are calm and there are an unusual number of birds on the water. But make no mistake these are definately fins attached to bodies that arch out of he water and back in. The fins are black and so are the bodies for the most part, This time I was able to detect some white on the bodies because they were so close. Sharyn Mellors

<br/><b>Comments:</b>At around 1600 K's and J's were lined up abreast in a slow resting pattern, moving north out in mid-Haro strait, a little north of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. They stayed up for a few minutes, with blows lined up for a hundred yards like a picket fence at times. Then they came up all heading south, still lined up abreast. Then they disappeared for several minutes, and when they surfaced, K's were still headed south, still lined up but moving at a pretty fast clip. J's had turned around and were now heading north, not quite lined up but in tight groups, still far out in mid-strait. After coming a mile or so north, J's went down again for several minutes and when they came up they were once again headed south, but this time they turned slightly in so that they were close to the cliffs of Bellevue Point, just north of Lime Kiln. K's stayed abreast in small groups far out in mid-strait. At last sighting, around 1730 both pods were still moving south, J's along the shore, K's way out in the middle.

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hello Susan, could you relay this to all our friends. Under the heavy cloud of this morning's tragedy, may I offer a report of whales to add a bit of sunshine. J's, K's, and L's cruised up the west-side of San Juan Island in a boisterous display of foraging and cavorting, clearly following large schools of salmon. The hydrophones were a'chatter with strong and continuous echololcations as they came by the Center for Whale Research in groups of 5-12 every two or three minutes apart. One group in particular was video taped actively tail-lobbing as a group, and as they moved north the whole group turned tight to the right in towards shore and circled tighter and tighter into themselves, probably catching all the salmon we've seeing "jumping" in the past few weeks. It was a beautiful morning of playful whales, and a peaceful sunny day dawned here in the islands. I truly hope this may add a small touch of cheer to you all on this very dark day!

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Just wanted to share some more sunshine from the whale-watch side - we had a most glorious day on our last day (Sunday the 9th) with all the whales by False Bay - i have to say it was almost as if they came by to give us an awesome send-off - they had all been absent and unaccounted for the two days before, so we were thrilled to see them back on our last day. The highlight was when a group of about 30-40 lined up and started porpoising towards our boat and made a high speed high porpoise pass right next to us - perhaps the most singularly beautiful sight all summer!! our Cappy Grant has a video of it also! then they pretty much put the brakes on and slowed
