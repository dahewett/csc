Susan, yesterday (July 18) with members of all three pods in Rosario was the most amazing day this year. I don't know if we are projecting, but it seemed to both Cindy Hansen and I that our whales are happier and healthier this year, although there is no scientific basis for this, just behavior observation.

<br/>*<br/>
L12's off the west side at 1134hrs between Lime Kiln and Pile Pt. 
At 1512 J's K's and it seems all of Lpod had joined (J's and K's down Rosario St.) the rest of Lpod inbound off Vic, at 0845. 
No sightings of the mystery whale.

<br/>*<br/>
We were with J's, K's and some of L's off of Kellett bluff, (Henry Island) and stayed with them as they went to Stuart. They were still going north when we left. 
The whales were very spread out, like yesterday, with lots of socializing and play along with foraging. They were breaching, spyhopping, tail lobbing, you name it! All the boats were dead in the water for very long periods of time. We had lots of close passes just sitting still. One of the new kids, not sure which, was doing a lot of jumping around. A great sign of a healthy youngster.

<p>J's and K's are now using Active Pass going N. Boundary Pass to return to Haro St. not Rosario. They did both yesterday (July 15). 
<br/>L12's seem to be happy going N. to Active Pass area and S. to Salmon Bank. 
<br/>Whales reported going E. off Sooke at 0900 today (July 16) but fog and rough water prevented any id, they were not seen later in the day. 
1108 at 48 29 .475 123 07 .401 there is always something magical about making contact with whales in the fog. J1 and some K's going S. 
1214 the first bow riding Dall's in a few weeks.

We met up with the whales on the west side of North Pender Island today aroun 2:00pm. The L-12s and L-22s were behind a large group of what appeared to be all of J and K Pod. It turned out that the L-2s were in 
there as well...resting along with Js and Ks. It was neat to see Luna's mom out and about. Gaia/L-78 appears to have begun sprouting! Although he is a year older than Skana/L-79 he is a bit behind in size but the process has definitely begun.

At 10:00 am a group of more than 20 Orca going north passed close by Mouat Point on North Pender Island in Swanson Channel. The pod was lead by "Wavy" [Ruffles - J1?] up near the front. Our hydrophone recorded a few vocalizations but the entire group were quite quiet and were likely foraging for food. Over half the group were within 15 yards of the shore line and provided a spectacular show of nature at its best. Only two boats watched from the water and they stopped their motors and were gentle in their observations. 
<br/>Alan Lowe, North Pender Island
<br/>*<br/>
Hello;
<br/>Sunday 8:00 pm, a pod of approx. 8-10 whales past by South Pender Island (Brook's Point) heading West towards Stewart Island (Turn Point). Not a single boat around them.

I'm on San Juan Island right now and just had a FANTASTIC day at Lime Kiln! J and K pod were going south at 11:30am this morning.. then at 1:40pm J's were back, heading north and came in close to shore and played in the kelp. Very playful, spread out, with about 30 boats around. Then at around 4pm, K's were heading south again and they just swam on by. 
Great day to be at Lime Kiln all day, with lots of people using the park to watch the action!
<br/>Vickie Doyle
<br/>*<br/>
At approx. 8:15 - K pod from the south end of Lopez Island. They were spread out and milling, heading south toward Whidbey, but then there was a breach, and within 5 minutes they'd changed direction and were heading NW. L pod was reported off Race Rocks at 7:15 pm, and earlier in the day, J's were reported off the west side of San Juan Island near the Center for Whale Research at 3:45pm.

Hi
<br/>Well, they're back! J,s and K,s off Victoria this morning going east 0900. Both pods went to San Juan Is. then turned South. 
Next they turned north. At 1518 Jpod going N. off Battleship Is. (Haro St). At 1622 Kpod going S. from the south side of Lime kiln Park. 
While this is going on Lpod going east from Otter Pt. at 1500hrs, nearing Race Rocks at 1700.

<p>
Report of whales off Eagle Pt. around 0945 also whales off Victoria at the same time. I had Lpod going W. just west of Race Rocks at 1052. No other whales seen. No whales found off San Juan Is. 
<br/>At 1556 contact with Lpod once more still going W. near Magdalena Pt. (west of Jordan River) no other whales seen at this time. 
<br/>At 1630 a report that J1 has popped into the picture and over the next few minutes more reports of Jpod whales coming in from the west. 
At this time I am on my way back to Victoria when reports of Kpod whales going west from Sheringham Pt. start to come in. 
Made contact with Kpod at 1650 going west but reports are now coming in that J's and L's have turned and are now E. coming towards the K's. 
It would seem that Jpod went West first in the early morning followed by Lpod. 
<br/>Kpod were the whales off Eagle Pt. who must have swung S.W. towards Port Angeles thus were missed by the American boats on the west side of San Juan Is. and came W. in Juan de Fuca well off shore.
