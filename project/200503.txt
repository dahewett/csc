<b>March 30, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
At <b>5:45 PM</b> two <b>grays</b> (one adult, one youngster) passed by my Langley office, travelling through Saratoga Passage at a liesurely pace toward Sandy Point. They were being followed by more than two dozen ducks that seemed to be quite interested in what they were stirring up in the water. Later that evening, at <b>8:45PM</b> I heard spouts outside my window--it was too dark to see how many whales were passing by. The sounds seemed to procede in the same direction (west to east).

<br/>*<br/>
2 <b>Gray</b> whales in Port Susan Sound at <b>9:00 am</b> feeding 100 to 150 yds off shore near the beach community of Spee-bi-dah. One whale was the one we named "TrimTail" 2 years ago. This the 3rd year we clearly ID this whale. Did not get a good look at the other.
<br/>Malcolm &amp; Tarry Lindquist
<br/>*<br/>
So the <b>Humpbacks</b> have made it up to Nootka sound and beyond now. Three Humpback whales passed by only 100 meters from shore. There were two adult whales and one not fully matured travelling close together, investigating a bit, circling the bays, on their slow journey south. No flukes shown, shallow dives. I also heard from a couple of people who have been out flying that they saw quite a few whales offshore travelling to the NW.
<br/>
Lisa Larsson, Nootka Island, BC

<b>March 27, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
We saw two <b>grays</b> off possession point sunday around <b>4pm</b> and watched them for over a hour as they moved south and then west around the south part of the point.
<br/>Thomas Elliott
<br/>*<br/>
Paul Shaumborg of Great Bend Charters in Union, Hood Canal, reported seeing the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at <b>7:52 pm</b>, all 6 of them spread out 3 miles north of Hamma Hamma, heading south, then crossed over to the Kitsap Penin. side still heading south at a good clip.
<br/>*<br/>
I have been gone all day and did not see them leave (<b>orcas</b> in Tacoma Narrows). The last time I saw them they were pointed south and moving very slowly about noon. I did not take any pictures. The young one seemed to us to be swimming on its side and rolling. The others never really came out of the water much.... just the one fin and then the breathing sounds.
<br/>Mari
<br/>Tacoma Narrows
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>7:30 PM</b> we stood outside for about 15 minutes and listened to a couple of <b>gray</b> whales feeding and breathing close to shore off of Langley. They were headed south.

At <b>4.30pm</b> the Slippery Six were still up north!!! and could be seen at the south end of the Toanados Penin. Kathy thought it was the same area she saw them in last Wed afternoon (Mar 23) with the NOAA team observing them.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, 
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
We have been watching a pod of <b>orcas</b> all morning in the Tacoma Narrows. They seem to have a baby which they are tending. Keeping it at the surface every few minutes. There are about 10 of them although there could be more or less because they are hard to count. The baby shows lots of white and is obviously quite small. They have been in the same area since <b>8:00am until at least 11:15am</b>. Coming apparently from the south (I was asleep until 8:00... stupid me!) they are swimming right in front of my house just south of the Narrows bridge.
<br/>Mari in the south Sound
<br/>*<br/>
Wendy of Langley called to report 2 <b>gray</b> whales at Sandy Pt, south of Langley at <b>12:10 pm</b>. They had come down from Saratoga Passage about 15 minutes earlier, &amp; appeared to be hanging around feeding off Sandy Pt.
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley

<br/><br/>
<b>March 26, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
So the <b>Grays</b> have made it up to Nootka sound and beyond now. First I saw a Gray whale pass in a strong SE wind heading out to sea on saturday the 26'th of March.
<br/>Lisa Larsson, Nootka Island, BC
<br/>*<br/>
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called to report 2 <b>grays</b> , including "Patch", in Saratoga Passage between Lowell Pt. &amp; Camano Head at <b>2 pm.</b>
<br/>*<br/>
First report was 3 <b>Transients</b> off William Head in bound at <b>1500</b>.
"Mallard" called to say he had at least 2, I waited a hour, went down to the (Victoria) waterfront and had a male and at least 1 other just not sure if there were more. Whales went east towards Oak Bay.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
Got a call from Mark Malleson late this afternoon that he had found two <b>Orcas</b>. We got there late in the afternoon, and left two <b>Transient</b> Orcas, a male and a female, about 1.5  miles from Discovery Is., headed toward the eastern point of Discovery Island, Seabird Pt. at <b>5:30 PM</b>.

<br/><br/>
<b>March 25, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Twanoh State Park...the whales were surfacing just near the boat launch about <b>noon</b>. It looked like the two adult females were in front and the others sort of mingled together all moving east. About 5 or 10 mins later it seemed they then changed directions and did some lunging and arching dives and definitely appeared to be doing some serious chasing... almost towards the boat.... from all different directions. For almost 3 hrs the guys stuck with the whales when they could. Finally I got started back to the car about <b>3.30pm</b> and saw the boat coming west at a clip and then saw whales crossing the channel south to north behind them so set up my scope again and waved at the crew. They waited and I believe witnessed another possible kill mid-channel north of the park. The last time I saw them again maybe <b>4.30pm</b> patiently waiting for the Slippery Six to emerge between Union and Tahuya and sure enough The Six came by in traveling mode nearer the north shore.
<br/>Judy Dicksion, Bremerton 
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>Jpod</b> about 13 miles WSW. of Victoria going about 4-5mph at <b>1630</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures relayed a report from Jim Maya that he had left <b>J pod</b> at Port Angeles at <b>3 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Not one blow, but two in close succession, so most likely two
whales--probably <b>grays</b> (didn't see any fins) one to two miles off Cultus
Bay,  southeast of the Scatchet Head Community Center:  <b>2:30 PM</b>.
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9.20am</b>... Dick of Glen Ayr Resort (N. Hoodsport) called to say the <b>whales</b> were near the Kitsap Penin opposite them milling about. I told him Steve J., WDFW, Josh L. UW and Volker Deeke were lauching at Potlatch. 9.36am Dick reported they had traveled north slowly and were in the area of Holiday Resort. At 9.40am Kathy, of MAKINPICZ, called to say they were across the canal from of her house above the Tides Restaurant.....Holiday Beach area...and were passed Union heading towards Alderbrook Resort! ...they all quickly disappeared into the cove at Tahuya (I think) at  approx. <b>11.00am</b>. At 11.35am the boat came out of the cove behind the <b>transients</b> heading steadily towards Twanoh State Park.
<br/>Judy Dicksion
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
We were thrilled to see several <b>orcas</b> (not sure specific number) off Holiday Beach near Hoodsport. They were playing, mainly near the east side of the canal, and visible from our home for nearly 45 minutes at about <b>9:30 AM</b>. The orcas were headed south.
<br/>Richard and Lynne Bailey

3 <b>Gray</b> whales in Port Susan Sound at <b>8:45 am</b>. 2 feeding 100 to 150 yds off shore near the beach community of Spee-bi-dah and 1 about a half mile from shore diving deep. All were working north.
<br/>Malcolm &amp; Tarry Lindquist
<br/>*<br/>
This morning, <b>8:40 am</b>, one <b>gray</b> was spotted heading south between Tulalip Shores and the south end of Camano.  At 9:00, two grays were spotted heading north in Port Susan, around the Spee-bi-dah area.  Both sightings found the grays in the middle of Port Susan and too far away to identify.  They were all moving along as with a purpose in mind, not feeding along the shores.
<br/>Vicki Mattson
<br/>Tulalip Shores
<br/><br/>
<b>March 24, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Carol from Glen Ayr Resort had called to say the <b>transients</b> were traveling north from opposite Glen Ayr at approx <b>9.20 am</b>. Sometime later they were seen milling about with lots of rolling over each other, various types of breaching which continued for about 30 min. and drew quite a crowd!  Carol thought they had possibly made a kill but saw no seabirds.
<br/>Judy Dicksion
<br/>Bremerton
<br/>*<br/>
On the east side of Whidbey, just north the Possesion Point "marina". We spotted the plumes, and saw flukes indicating deeper dives, they were in the same place, only earlier, perhaps <b>10:00 AM</b>. Cruisin' along, plumes and humps visible, and then up come the flukes and down they go. Then they are out of our line of sight.
<br/>Rob Harrison
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas</b> off Holiday Beach near Hoodsport.
<br/>Richard and Lynne Bailey
<br/>Hoodsport, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Windwalker Taibi called at <b>8:55 pm</b> to report at least 2 <b>gray</b> whales blowing &amp; splashing at East Pt, very close to shore.
<br/>*<br/>
We had the chance to observe an adult <b>Minke</b> whale at Hein Bank this afternoon. The animal was behaving in the usual Minke pattern of zig zagging around a rather large area. Possible second Minke though not confirmed.
<br/>Victoria Kirkland
<br/>Island Adventures, Anacortes
<br/>*<br/>
I followed Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> today. I spotted the HCT Orcas, all 6, in front of the Hoodsport Winery at about <b>10:45 a.m</b>. They appeared to be hunting, but no seagulls feeding. Jumping, splashing, rolling, tail stands and tail slaps. They were in a very playful mood for the three hours I followed them. They were moving North against the incoming tide. They stayed mainly in the center of the canal. However, around <b>1:20 p.m</b>. they came over to West side or HWY 101 side of the canal. They were jumping straight out of the water, falling back, normal diving jumps, rolling, tail slaps and stands. One was even floating on it's back! Just being happy, playful Orcas. Once the show was over they started their power swim. Last seen at the Hamma Hamma Oyster Farm heading North.
<br/>Harry Louch
<br/>Hoodsport
<br/>*<br/>
Two, possibly 3, <b>grays</b> just south of Mabana, <b>4:40 PM</b>, two feeding in the shallows, and one further out in the channel. Moving north toward Mabana.

<br/>*<br/>
Derrick Whitmarsh of Pebble Beach, Camano Island (across from Langley, Whid. Isl) called at <b>3:35 pm</b> to report a <b>gray</b> whale traveling up Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from Celeste at the Depoe Bay Whale Ctr. in OR, relaying a report from the Lewis &amp; Clark Interp. Ctr. at Ilwaco, reporting 4 - 5 <b>orcas</b> between the jetties, traveling east up toward the Columbia River at <b>11:30 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
We watched the 3 <b>orca</b> whales moving north on Hood Canal from just north of Hoodsport, WA and followed them to the area south of Lilliwap where the Tides resturant is and they were still going North. It was a delight to see them playing and breaching and rolling in the water. The water was very calm, and they were being viewed by many along hiway 101. The time was about <b>10:45 am</b>.

<br/>*<br/>At <b>0900 until 0945</b> observed 5 or 6 <b>Orcas</b> about mid-channel of Hood Canal. I was on Highway 106 about 1/4 mile west of Alderbrook Resort. I followed the Highway to the Union Marina and observed the Orcas until they turned North at Bald Point. During the initial observation I saw many birds milling around the water and what appeared to be a small head of a seal. The orca's were Spyhoping and rolling on their sides. I observed this thru a 50 power set of binoculars. After they finished with the seal they cruised away and made the big turn at the Great Bend in the Hood Canal.

I first saw the (<b>Transient</b> orca) group near Hoodsport about <b>11:3o AM</b>, closer to the opposite side of the canal. I went home to get my camera and found them heading north very slowly, eating, playing and taking advantage of the sunny day, pretty much oblivious to the human entourage of vehicles following them along highway 101!! I met one of your loyal posters, Harry Louch, at Eagle Creek about noonish where we discovered they had actually turned south again! We headed south on 101 about two or more miles to find them very close to shore! We then followed the Orca north again, and stopped at Jorstad Creek pulloff and watched them pass by in "travel' mode.

I met up with the NOAA researchers at Triton Cove. Launching about 10.45 am they went north in search of the Slippery Six who conveniently had "slipped" below near the Duckabush Delta leaving the researchers to forge ahead of them! Fortunately, Brian McLaughlin, Fish Biologist from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab and his crew George Peterson and Mark Millard were working in the area and managed to contact the researchers when they saw the whales near them. Luckily the researchers were able to return and quickly to visually "latch on" to their elusive subjects with the crews' help... about 11.30 am.  Hubby Don had managed to get in some flying and saw the two boats so was circling  also in the same area, thus between all of them, the Slippery Six did not slip away for the second time! The six decided to visit the Kitsap Side of the canal and around to Seabeck. I understand the Six made a kill and then continued with their "after meal" play time! This happened to involve another seal I understand, who was batted around like a shuttle cock for well over an hour....and possibly survived! John D. said  the boat was stationary as they observed the behavior but with the thrown seal landing sometimes pretty near to the boat they had to be ready to move out of the way fast.... Maybe the Six wanted them to join in?????
About <b>2.30pm</b> the whales started moving over towards the Toanados Penin making some deep dives and then slowly sufacing for a few breaths.

One whale which stayed at least a mile from the 50ft charter boat we were on appeared to be a mature male, but it was too far off to tell for sure. One whale breached twice, bringing cheers from the crowd, but mostly the pod was just traveling, some porpoising. One whale with a calf did some rolling at the surface.

At approximately <b>5:15pm</b> I spent about 45 minutes watching the group (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) move South starting just South of Hood Point. I noticed many birds flying over one spot and then noticed the whales, lots of acrobatics, splashing and horsing around with each other. I was surprised at how much contact they have with each other and how rough that contact appeared to be at the time. Saw them throwing what appeared to be a seal very high in the air several times. The group kept moving south almost the whole time while all this was going on. The group moved past Triton cove about mid channel and continued south. After about another 10 minutes it looked like they got another seal. It looked very much like the first seal, I wonder if they would carry it with them that distance. They would flip it in the air with their tail and sometimes it looked like they would throw it with their mouths.

Cascadia Research Gray Whale Survey Results - To follow up on our survey... We found a tight group of 3 <b>gray</b> whales traveling south from the far northern end of Port Susan late yesterday afternoon. We stayed with them for about an hour and successfully identified three of them as whales previously sighted in Northern Puget Sound, ID numbers 44, 56, and 531.  Although 44 and 56 have extensive sighting histories, 531 had only been sighted in the sound once before, in 2000. We received word of the whale entering Holmes Harbor later in the day, and unfortunately our survey in that area hadn't taken us quite far enough north to catch it, maybe next time... thanks to all who had their eyes on the water for us.

Cindy said she witnessed several kills and then the whales moved north. At 10.00am they were seen continuing north passed Eagle Creek. Finally the transients appeared... as reported by phone.  We watched from along the roadside until they had passed Zelatched Pt., Toanados Penin. at about 3.30pm. and were continuing north at an amazing speed. We could see many saddle patches (and notice some as quite different from the others) as they rode over the waves. At 4.30pm they were directly in mid-channel east of the Shellfish Lab then went under for a long time before we saw them entering Quilcene Bay in a traveling mode with long underwater dives and heading as if towards the head of the bay.

The last report had three orcas about 3 miles past Alderbrook Resort with them heading east but performing a few antics about 100 ft from shore! The location given was the 12 mile marker which possibly begins where Hwy 106 to Twanoh branches off Hwy 101..... so the whales may have been near to Twanoh State Park perhaps.... quite a way inland!  Sounds like this could have been the ones who were also reported as being seen near Sisters Point (Kitsap Peninsula) at 11.15 am ...possibly on returning westward.

Tally ho....the <b>whales</b> are still here!.....Waaaay down south mind you, west of the Alderbrook Resort, Hood Canal, an excited new <b>orca</b> fan tried to describe the ensuing antics that were being performed....but apparently it was not so much a private showing, as first believed, as the whales kept it up (at a slower pace I understand) when the research boat approached them around <b>2.00 p.m.</b>

Judy Dicksion called to say her husband Don had finally found the Hood Canal <b>transients</b> at <b>5 pm</b>, between Hoodsport &amp; Potlatch, heading south.
<br/>*<br/> 
Well tonight, about <b>5 p.m.</b>, the Hood Canal <b>Orcas</b> were right in front of my house just South of Hoodsport. About mid-canal across from the Hoodsport Winery. It is very apparent after watching them for about an hour that in the "Orca World" it is O.K. to play with your food. There was a lot of diving activity, rolls, tail flashes, splashing, surfacing together, whales going to the right as whales went to the left. However in all the mealay I would occasionally see a small head surface with no sense of which way to go.  It was to small for the baby Orca so I am sure it was a seal. Then an Orca would either surface from under it or dive onto it. Only to see the seal bob up again in a few minutes. They were still active at 6, but working their way North.

I spoke with fishermen at the Quilcene Marina early evening today (Mar 2) and one said the <b>transients</b> were in Quilcene Bay about <b>2.30 pm</b> and passed the marina towards the head of the bay (to the north). The other fishermen said the transients' "routine" is to go to the head of the bay as the seals and sea lions around the beach and marina will swim up there when the transients are in the area.

I had an adult male <b>orca</b> pass by 50 meters from shore here at Nootka yesterday at <b>16:15</b>. He had a big straight dorsal fin, a little wavy at the trailing edge, and was travelling at a steady pace southbound. Three breaths followed by a long dive observed twice. There are lots of sealions and harbour seals in the area right now.
