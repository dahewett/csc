We had a magical encounter with <strong>J28 Polaris and her new baby J54 </strong>on Thursday. This is the little cutie pie peeking above the surface while swimming next to mom. Haro Strait, off San Juan Island. -Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Images from my oh-so-special encounter with the <strong>J28's...(photo of Polaris J28 and her son J54, and Star J46, her little brother J54 &amp; their mom Polaris J28)</strong>. Every whale is special, but the longer you are out here and spend time with these orcas, there are certain individuals you end up gravitating towards for a multitude of reasons. J28, Polaris, is one of those whales to me. When I first starting seeing wild Killer whales in the San Juans, I almost always saw her. It likely had something to do with how identifiable she was with her nick in the dorsal fin, but nearly every encounter, there she was. So she quickly became a whale I loved now for almost 10 years. It's been a great pleasure and joy to watch her go from a little teenage rascal to a very caring and responsible adult with now 2 kids. So this encounter, while would have been special no matter which whale, was elevated for me because it was Polaris. We got to see special family bonding time, rolling, cuddling, and just being together.... -Traci Walter

We received a call at <strong>3:30 from Blythe Marshman of the Bodega Marine Lab in CA. She was 80% sure she saw an orca </strong>close to shore near a seal rookery there at the lab in Bodega Bay. She only saw the dorsal fin once, very close to shore, then it disappeared and she couldn't find it again. She said the seals were all way up on the rocks, so it's quite possible a Transient was cruising the area looking for lunch. -Susan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Enjoying the unusually warm weather, Mystic Sea headed out to find <strong>gray whales - we had four of them</strong> today, quite a treat. First off, <strong>#531 was feeding in the shallow bays near Everett</strong>, often on her side with her pectoral fin showing, and also part of her fluke (tail). Next we found <strong>#723 who surprised us by his close pass-by, then #49 Patch joined in, followed by #383 who gave us many looks at his fluke</strong>. The water was like a mirror, so beautiful, happy smiles for everybody. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Ok, so the transient orcas gave us the slip today (sigh) but we did catch up with a few grays and one that is quickly becoming my favorite, a female, <strong>#531 who was near Everett</strong>. She has the most beautiful marbled markings on her back, on both sides, and the underside of her tail is easy to ID. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We had a rare visitor this afternoon! This <strong>Gray Whale spent a couple hours swimming up and down McAllister Creek within a stone's throw of the Estuary Boardwalk Trail </strong>- it only happens once ever few years! As the tide went out, we were worried as it got caught up on a couple sandbars, but it finally headed out to the deep waters of Puget Sound. -Michael Schramm/USFWS, <strong>Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge</strong>
<br/><br/>

Can anyone confirm a sighting in Hale Passage east of <strong>Fox Island of a small pod around 5pm</strong>? (likely the pod of <strong>Ts around Tacoma</strong> earlier who disappeared despite many eyes on the water). -Douglas Ribeca

I love it when we are the first to find whales! The Peregrine found <strong>two humpbacks, nicknamed Heather BCY1060 and Splitfluke BCX1068</strong>. Haro Strait, abeam of Battleship Island. -Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><strong>3:50 p.m. -  T137A from Mabana on Camano</strong>, seeing blows and dorsals powering through the chop, heading north mid-channel  sightline between Mabana and Langley. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Dick Snowberger called at about <strong>3:30, watching from Boy &amp; Dog Park on First St, Langley, seeing one or two Gray whales feeding south of Camano Head</strong>, and also saw the four Transient orcas pass by them heading north up Saratoga Passage, off south Camano Island.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>3:17 p.m. - T137's within 200 yards of two grays</strong>.
<br/>(Below is the description of what ensued)
<br/><strong>Major altercation between the 137's and #56 and 531.</strong> 137a drove into them from the south and mom drove in from the North. Both grays rolled over maybe a dozen times, pecs flying. T137 and 137a trashed about around them for about 5 minutes and then moved on. 56 and 531 are now in the shallows of Camano Head and look no worse for wear. Pretty wild!....When we watched that incident with Patch several years ago it was pretty brief, the 8 or so kw passed under him and he spun around, showed his belly to the surface and probably gave a bubble blast to ward them off. As Tyson and myself recall today, it seemed like 137a (14 year old) kind of went in on his own, and mom bolted in after him. The grays were not having it, and all three calves quickly bolted away after the scuffle, mom following behind them after they were clear. Tough to say, but it seemed like 137a was just being a punk and picking a fight he shouldn't have.
<br/><strong>3:10 p.m. - T137's!</strong>
<br/><strong>2:50 p.m. - </strong>Got them. N side of Gedney moving to Saratoga. -Michael Colahan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>2:15 p.m. - Group of 3 Orcas sighted just north of Clinton Ferry Dock</strong>. Appeared to be 2 adults and a smaller one. Head north towards Langley. -Doug B

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>2:15 p.m. -</strong> Sandra Pollard just called to report seeing <strong>4 Transient orcas from the ferry at the Mukilteo ferry landing</strong>. She sees one male, two females and one juvenile, heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island. And added: "We were returning to Clinton on the 2:00 pm ferry, and almost at the ferry dock. The ferry captain announced that there were 'porpoises off the beach, port side.' I went outside and saw a fast disappearing dorsal fin on the port side, then saw three dorsal fins pop up on the starboard side heading towards Gedney (Hat) Island, seemingly on a mission. Two shorter dorsal fins and one smaller dorsal fin, then husband Dick spotted a big dorsal fin coming up behind."

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today at <strong>630pm we spotted a pod of 5 (we think) orcas in Campbell river.</strong> Between the light house and red bell bouy. There was 2-3 very small orcas. They were travelling south. -Micah Anderson  
 
 <br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>A gray hung out just South of Titlow Beach</strong> with Tacoma Narrows Bridge at sunset tonight and was feeding along the Northern tip of Day Island. He seemed to be so black and so big but not like an orca. And he seemed to be alone unless there was a baby. I kept seeing a little fin. (pec fin while on side feeding). -Karen Caldwell

 <br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Dick Snowberger called at about <strong>3:30, watching from Boy &amp; Dog Park on First St, Langley, seeing one or two Gray whales feeding south of Camano Head, and also saw the four Transient orcas pass by them heading north up Saratoga Passage</strong>, off south Camano Island.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>12:09 p.m. - </strong>While sitting on the ferry, two blows were spotted about .5 miles east of the Clinton Ferry terminal.   The was a whale watching boat nearby.  No fins noted, just blows.  At least two whales were present.  They looked like grey whales from what little I could see.
Scott Shea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>11:20 a.m. - </strong>Sandra Pollard called from the Clinton-Mukilteo ferry, reporting <strong>two Grays south of Hat Island</strong>.

<strong>10:55 a.m. - Gray whales 49, 723, 383 south Gedney Island</strong> from Island Explorer 4. All grouped up. -Michael Colahan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>3:00 p.m. -</strong> we encountered <strong>"Heather" BCY0160 a couple of miles SE of Trial Island</strong>. She had first been encountered earlier in the day by Mark from POW. When we encountered her she was being very sleepy at first but started to wake up after about 20 minutes and we saw her tail fluke 4 or 5 times. -Andrew Lees, Five Star Whale Watching

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Wow, only <strong>12:30</strong> on Easter Sunday and already had an awesome (albeit VERY wet) orca encounter with the <strong>J17's and J22's</strong> (thanks Ivan!) near Upright Head. I am absolutely floored by the size of J38! He used to be such a runty little dude and now definitely sprouting and becoming a strapping young fellow. -Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>7:00 a.m. -</strong> Fred Rickley on the ferry Samish reported seeing <strong>a female and calf orca near Upright Head</strong>, at the north end of Lopez Island. No others were seen, and no direction was given.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Eric from Mystic Sea reports <strong>Gray #21 and #49, Patch near West Gedney Island, #723, #56, #531 near South Gedney Island, unidentified gray near Sandy Point heading towards Langley</strong>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

 Enjoying another day of sunshine, we left Langley and headed towards Camano Head where a whale had been spotted earlier, no luck there so we headed to <strong>Hat/Gedney Island and were rewarded with the sight of three of our favorite gray whales, feeding together. We had #49 Patch, #531 and #723. </strong>They slowly traveled along the east side of the island, then we heard there was <strong>a Humpback whale near Baby Island! A Humpback??</strong> We headed northward, and sure enough, a humpback whale was feeding in the entrance to Holmes Harbor, along with many California sea lions and harbor porpoise, and seabirds. What a treat and very unusual - an amazing day for sure. -Jill Hein - volunteer naturalist.

<strong>7:20 p.m. - a large pod of Orcas briskly exited Hood Canal</strong>. We last saw them between the entrance of Port Ludlow and Foulweather Bluff heading northward. There were <strong>at least a half dozen</strong>.  Also, nearly a steady stream of hundreds of Porpoises, were observed for hours late afternoon and evening along the Hood Canal side of Foulweather bluff. <strong>All were swimming northward</strong>. -Douglas Paeth

<strong>4:43p.m. - Looking across Hood Canal south of bridge/Lofall area at what appears to be a pod of Orcas</strong>. Anyone have insight? Trying to get photos but we are on the opposite side of canal. They seem to be stationary right now and hunting. Lots of breaching. Will let you know if we get a sense of direction. At least 3. -Leslie Boyd

Spent the afternoon with the <strong>T137s. Caught up with them just south of San Juan Island and kept pace with them as they traveled past Friday Harbor and up into San Juan Channel</strong>. Just south of Yellow Island they hit pay dirt and purposefully dispatched of a harbor seal. Lots of pecs and fins and a big spyhop for good measure. We left them as they continued north. Epic encounter! -Debbie Stewart

...Three deployments of suction-cup attached video tags (on <strong>49, 383, and 723</strong>) with two still on into the night. Both tags were on until early this morning (did not hear them at 0500 but were off at 0600 so sometime between then) and recovered them later that morning, both appeared in good working order and recording but will not know for sure if the data is good for a day or two). <strong>Documented feeding in the shallows of the Snohomish</strong> by two whales at high tide both this morning and evening, two others feeding shallow <strong>just south of Tulalip Bay</strong>, and tonight <strong>three feeding off W Camano near Mobana</strong>. Collected one fecal sample from one of the animals we tagged yesterday (49) and also got a skin sample of one more of our unsexed animals (56 which leaves only one left we have not sampled and not yet seen this year). -John Calambokdis, Cascadia Research Collective

<strong>2:30 p.m. - </strong>Whale Sighting. In 60 years I have never seen <strong>a whale in the lower end of Hood Canal</strong>. 1 whale traveling. (<em>reported as Pilot whale but all <strong>probability is orca</strong>. See 1:30 report below, and our  March 27th includes reports of orcas on the 26th. - ALB</em>)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<strong>1:30 p.m. - Orca Sighting</strong>, The one I saw as not real big. At the time I was thinking a smaller female. We were approximately <strong>a mile north of Belfair State Park on Hood Canal</strong>. The weather was perfectly clear and I had a totally unobstructed view of Hood Canal. All of a sudden I saw a whale blow and an Orca surface, then go back down. It had a large dorsal that was sagging over and I could see the black back. It didn't come out of the water enough to see any white on it, but I know it was an Orca. (Years ago I spent 10 years commercial fishing in Washington and Alaska and have encountered many whales and marine mammals). I alerted the other people who were there and we began watching for it to surface again. About 10 minutes later we saw it surface and spout a few hundred yards down the beach. That was our last sighting. I am familiar with the waters it was in and it was traveling northward along a shelf that is about 30 ft deep. It was like it was feeding on something, but I have now idea what as it is not salmon season. I know Orcas travel in pods and there certainly could have been more off the beach that we were just not seeing. -Michael Birkland

<strong>Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage</strong>
<br/>They were incredible! Especially from Fox Spit, we were so lucky as they would dive down for long periods of time but decided to come up right out in front of Fox Spit, this side of mid channel, closer to Whidbey. First saw them at Bells Beach and then left them at the end of Baby Island dock while they headed north, but were coming towards BI. A lot of Sea Lions in 3 separate bunches barking up a storm, like crazy! The pod flipped, turning southbound in the early evening. -Marilyn Armbruster

<strong>Hood Canal</strong>
<br/><strong>11:00 a.m. - </strong>Follow up report from yesterday. Saw two today; <strong>two blows, two fins, one smaller, heading south down Hood Canal closer to the east shore just north of Lilliwaup</strong>. Seemed too few for Orcas. I hope someone else saw these and can ID them...Dorsals look like Orca, their bodies are dark as they come up out of the water. They traveled like Orcas too.  Height of the blows have to guess at several feet.  I was seeing them across the wide part of the canal without my binoculars.  Saw them yesterday at 5:30pm near Hoodsport too. (see Nick's report below and Jeni's March 24 report) -Jeni Gray

<strong>9:30-10:00 a.m. - We had a pod of orcas cruise by us about half way down the hood canal</strong> today. Was very cool. We were fishing a beach on the west side of the canal when we saw them cruising south near the Eastern shore. They were definitely orcas and from what I could see there <strong>appeared to be three of them</strong> but I'm not 100% on that. They were cruising south around 930-10 am, and about an hour and a half later we saw them cruise back along the same side heading north. Would have been not too far north of Dewatto. -Nick Clayton

A quick update: A very successful day on the water for this area. We <strong>IDed 6 whales (21, 49, 56, 383, 531, 723) with that being the first day 21 has been seen this season</strong>. We obtained <strong>two biopsies, of 383 (not sexed yet) and 531 (known female due to calve and which we can use to test for pregnancy)</strong>. <strong>Three deployments of vide tags (49, 383, and 723)</strong> with two still on into the night. This is way more than I hoped for out of one day on the water. We are headed back out this morning to do another survey and to look to do tag recoveries (if they are off) but likely not deploy any more tags. We will be looking for an opportunity to biopsy 56 who has not been sampled or sexed yet and would complete our sex determinations on the most regular whales. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective

<strong>7:00 p.m. - from Grand Ave Park in Everett, we watched 2 possibly 3 gray whales </strong>this evening west of the marina that's across from Jetty Island. They were spread out.

<strong>J54 SEX CONFIRMED AS MALE.</strong> - I couldn't believe how lucky we were with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. Together, Captain Andy and I made a great team to find J Pod traveling slowly north in Swanson's Channel! Because of Andy's hawk eyes, I was finally able to spend some quality time with <strong>J54 and his mother, J28 Polaris</strong>. During that time, J28 Polaris lifted him up on her rostrum in a playful display of affection, and I was able to get a clear photo of his abdomen confirming his sex. I can't take all of the credit though! Researchers already knew that he was male from previous photographs, but I was able to provide them with a clear shot that they could share. Luckily, I was in the right spot at the right time and had my camera ready. I love it when teamwork works out! -Heather MacIntyre

<strong>5:51pm - </strong>Whale sighting. Lots of spouting and tiny whale tale. Then saw the whale again spout appx 15 minutes later, headed South towards Downtown Edmonds. Moving Slow. <strong>First spotted at 5:21pm.</strong> Didn't make it more than a mile traveling in half hour. Baby humpback?! I recognized the humpback back at one point.. maybe the adult.. and then this video though is such a tiny tail. It was a side view of course and my phone camera was zoomed in, so a bit far away. But close enough to shore to catch a glimpse at least. I see a tiny spray first in the video! Much smaller than the other sprays we also saw! You can count on it here first...Oh yeah. Baby whale! -AnaLisa Gerbig

<strong>Humpback or possibly Gray Whale in Budd Inlet.</strong> I am the coach of the Olympia Yacht Club Junior Sailing program. Today, March 23, at our High School Sailing practice we had a whale join us! We were practicing at the very southern end of Budd Inlet near the Port Plaza dock. The whale surfaced 2 times, roughly 7 minutes apart, spouting both times a vertical column of water. The first time it surfaced less than 200 yards from my boat. I suspect it was a humpback, it was a grey/pinkish color with with barnacles on it's back. It was quite the thrill as the inlet is both narrow and shallow near the OYC (we set marks that day and only had to feed out about 30ft of line), a large whale is the last thing I'd expect to see that far south! -Sara Hanavan

I'm partnering up with Tony on this observation and we're looking through a spotting scope at a distance of approximately 2 miles plus. We thought we would identify it by the single-column blow and the long duration between blows (10 to 15 min). Admittedly, I'm a birder and not an experienced whale watcher so anything is possible....We were only able to spot the fluke and the head of the animal after it spouted. It appeared to be white under the mouth and down the ventral side. Because of the great distance, even with 36x spotting scope, we considered the duration between blows which was greater than 10 min and as much as 15. We know there were <strong>at least three animals</strong>. Again, I am not an experienced whale observer. I have seen numerous Humpbacks while in the Navy in Hawaii but they were only 100 meters from the ship. I counted gray whales in Monterey Bay for school but they were less than one kilometre away. -Bob Schultz

Today we had our <strong>first on-the-water encounter with J pod</strong> this year! It was a bit of a dreary Northwest day, but that certainly didn't dampen the excitement.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just an incredible encounter with <strong>Jpod off Discovery Island</strong>. Very tight groups with a lot of surface time, some seasnakes, and lots of baby play. There is something so magical and powerful to see these incredible families and their strong bonds together, like <strong>15-month-old J50 Scarlet and her mom J16 Slick, J17 Princess Angeline and her 5-month-old offspring J53, and J34 Doublestuf aside a belly-flopping nearly 4-month-old J54</strong>. As I watched this scene take place, I think to the future. Will they have enough food to eat? What will the year ahead bring these Endangered animals. We still need to talk about Salmon and dam removal! Please remember to call the White house and urge President Obama to remove the lower 4 Snake River Dams. We also got to observe Ken Balcomb from the Center for Whale Research.  He's been studying these whales for 40 years! -Traci Walter

Nice to see <strong>gray whale #383 has returned to Saratoga Passage</strong>. He was seen today <strong>feeding with #56, just south of Hat Island. Whales #531 and #49 Patch were near the entrance to Port Susan too</strong>. Great to see Patch back in our waters, he's been recorded being here locally every year since 1991 (Cascadia Research Collective records). -Jill Hein

S<strong>aw #383 today!  About noon, between Everett and Hat Island</strong>, we were with #383 and then as we were leaving we saw another one in the distance near Hat Island. Out with Chilkat. Mystic Sea and Redhead had just joined us so they probably got an ID on the other one. -Janine Harles

Around <strong>15:30 we spotted a gray whale</strong>. We were in <strong>Fay Bainbridge park in Bainbridge Island</strong>. So exciting! It's the first time we spot a wild whale. I believe it was going north east...I am not sure whether it was a gray whale or a humpback. It might have been the same humpback someone else spotted earlier! We only saw it for a few second when it came out for air and then its tail came out all the way and it was gone. It was kinda far from us, we were looking through binoculars.

<strong>3:19 p.m. - Patch is southbound along the west side of Gedney</strong>. We watched him swim right into the middle of a bunch of kayakers. A group of kayakers at the northern end of Gedney Island got quite a surprise Saturday afternoon when <strong>Saratoga Gray #49 Patch</strong> who had been seen further offshore suddenly surfaced in the middle of the group and decided to hang around while foraging on the bottom. The group did a very nice job of calmly backing up and giving him room. Saratoga Passage <strong>Gray Whale #531</strong> fluke ID. Along the western side of Camano Island. With Island Adventures.

We believe we saw a <strong>mama grey whale and her calf</strong> (can't rule out mom/calf, but we haven't heard anyone else report that) We were <strong>east of Camano Island near Camano Head</strong>. They were close to the shoreline as you can see by the houses in the background and we assume feeding  there.  We watched them as they stayed in that area for over an hour. Couldn't really say they were traveling they appeared to be busy feeding and circling around,  mostly close to the beach....The second one was smaller and  sometimes snuggled up close to the first one but was usually  traveling fairly close behind.  We could see that the tail fin was much smaller,  the length of time you saw the back was much shorter and the blow smaller too. -Erica Rayner-Horn

On a beautifully calm sunny day we left Langley and very quickly spotted the spout of our <strong>first gray whale. It was #531, just south of Camano Head</strong>. Then more spouts to the south - so off in that direction where we eventually found <strong>two whales traveling together, #56 and #723</strong>. They were feeding along the shallow bank just <strong>south of Hat (Gedney) Island.</strong> Such a good feeding area for these whales in approximately 25 feet of water. Homeward bound we found something you don't see too often - a bald eagle landed on tree trunk debris in the middle of Saratoga Passage .. we caught him taking off to catch his lunch. A fun day on Mystic Sea, as usual. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

<strong>5:00 p.m. -</strong> I think I say a gray <strong>(humpback) whale in the Nisqually Reach</strong>. (humpback based on other sightings/photos and further details from Rosemarie). I live on Johnson Point outside of Olympia. My house has a view of the Nisqually Reach from Devil's Head, the Drayton Passage, Anderson Island and down towards the Wildlife Refuge. I watched what appeared to be a young gray periodically breaching while traversing the Reach in the direction of the Nisqually Refuge. My first whale sighting. It seemed as if the whale would shoot perpendicularly out of the water, appear to remain suspended for a few seconds and then lean/topple to the right.  There were at least 4 breaches before I lost sight of the whale. It was during one of the periodic lulls yesterday from the high winds. Wow!! I hope this is helpful. -Rosemarie M. Robinson

Surprise - <strong>J Pod is back!</strong> I couldn't have been happier to welcome J Pod back into the Salish Sea today. They were a little elusive in the morning, but by the afternoon <strong>we found them right outside of our harbor (Snug Harbor)</strong> heading up the west side of San Juan Island. <strong>As usual, the first orca to pass us was none other than J2 Granny</strong> who is getting older in her years. She is estimated to be born in 1911, and while she may not be exactly 105 years old, she's still the oldest orca ever recorded that we know of! J19 Shachi and J40 Suttles followed behind while her daughter and grandson played nearby. It was so nice to see her and the rest of my favorite matriline, the J16s. -Heather MacIntyre, Maya's Legacy

<strong>J pod in Haro Strait, spread in loose family groups across the border and traveling North</strong>. It was our first time seeing <strong>J28 with her new calf, J54</strong>, born December 2015.

<strong>JPOD!!!  J pod moseyed on by Lime Kiln State Park today on the west side of San Juan Island</strong>. They were getting pushed up with the flood tide and taking it nice and slow doing some foraging behavior as they went.

At 2:15 the trailers were several miles offshore still facing north but not making much progress. Now that I'm back home there are still some calls on the hydrophones, so they may have turned and are coming back south. -Monika Wieland

I then heard it surface (it was behind a tree from my view) and saw it surface one more time.  It was also alone, making me think humpback.  But in retrospect I can't swear I saw a dorsal fin so I may be wrong.) -Ruth Westra

...We left Snug Harbor at 1250 and got <strong>on scene at 1326 about a mile and a half north of Swartz Bay</strong>. Since both Peregrine and Legacy had recently left the whales, we had to re-find them which we did after a brief search. The <strong>T18's (T18, T19, T19B, T19C) had already exited Shute Passage into Satellite Channel</strong> and appeared to be resting as they were traveled slowly west in a tight group... Read full summary at CWR T18s Encounter #16. -Dave Ellifrit &amp; Deborah Giles, CWR

My first Gray Sighting, <b>Manaco Beach...Camano Island...Saratoga Pass...just north of Cama Beach S.P.</b> This always seems to happen in the first five days of March. Heard and then saw my first Gray of the year this morning <b>about 10am</b>. It was moving north, rather close in, just outside our moorings. When our Labrador was younger, she would hear them first and give us a single bark while facing the direction of the beach. Now I must use an outdoor microphone to hear them coming. -Dick Schlueter
