Over by <b>San Juan Island</b> we caught up with <b>J pod</b> as we saw Blackberry (J27) and his family though there were other big males around as well. Then it was on to<b> a humpback whale </b>just further north! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We put our kayak in at the boat ramp at<b> Eglon around 4:30</b> and this video was shot at about<b> 5:00 p.m.</b> between Eglon and Whidbey Island. It was incredible! The [<b>humpback</b>] whale continued South, then came around behind us a bit and was <b>VERY close to the Eglon shore</b>. We didn't capture any more video as we were just trying to live the moment. That kayak paid for itself today! - Andrea Ogg

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:12pm -</b> I was with Connie and we had a heck of a treat! After the breach this  [<b>humpback</b>] whale slapped his tail in a fury for at least 10 minutes straight! The wind was calm as were the seas...all we heard was the amazing sound of this tail ! Another great day! More pics to come...last we saw, she was headed east <b>towards Edmonds</b>. A blessed moment - no doubt! - Elyse Sollitto

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:56 - </b>Its already down almost to <b>Edmonds</b>.
<br/><b>3:31 - </b>Heading south again near<b> Possession pt</b>.
<br/><b>3:29 -</b> He's stopped between <b>Maxwelton Beach and the SE of Whibey</b>. He breached and had been tail slapping for like 10 min.
<br/><b>3:11 - </b> it's headed south at a pretty steady clip. Its almost to <b>Maxwelton</b>.
<br/><b>2:45 - Humpback at Point No Point</b> day two! - Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

Maia from Washington State Ferries Ops called to relay a report from <b>7:49 am</b>, San Juan Island Inter-Island ferry run: <b>5 female and 2 juvenile orcas northbound in Wasp Passage</b> between Crane and Bell Islands (NW of Shaw Island).

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 am - </b>Saw <b>one Orca male</b> and a little farther south <b>a pod of several others</b> in <b>San Juan Channel NE of San Juan Is</b>. - Ted Treadwell 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:55 - 2nd humpback or same one? Southeast of Point No Point headed south</b> close to Kitsap side.
<br/><b>2:17 -</b> I just spotted a humpback whale going on a deep dive <b>north of Point No Point</b>. It was pointed east. - Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>T046B2</b> was harassing a Rhinoceros auklet in the <b>Juan de Fuca Strait</b>. - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:05 - </b>sweet sounds of <b>resident orcas on Lime Kiln</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

An acrobatic breaching <b>humpback in Spieden Channel at 1:30 pm!</b> This active tail/pectoral fin slapping visitor took passengers on Mystic Sea by surprise with a sudden full breach, a magnificent and breath-taking sight, before hitting the glassy water with a huge, resounding splash. What an unexpected treat for everyone as the long, hot summer draws to a close. - Sandra Pollard (SSAMN)
<br/><i>Tasli Shaw: BCY0409 "Yogi" in case you were curious</i>.

I just LOVE fall on the water out here. There is just so much awesome wildlife to see ... It was gorgeous out there today. I got to see something I've never seen before today! We had a very close encounter with <b>J35 Tahlequah</b>. She came up to us (after we'd been sitting in the same spot for about twenty minuets), and just when I thought she was going to swim by, she turned around at the stern of the boat and circled us very slowly. She looked up at us the entire time. I'll tell you- killer whales do something to our soul. When a creature as intelligent as us, and even more magnificent, makes intentional contact with you it penetrates deep within. When you have encounters like that with killer whales, you can't help but be forever changed. Killer whales bring out the good in every human. - Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This was really cool to watch. Just to the right was a yacht I have never seen before. The whale is <b>J32 Rhapsody</b>, who swam up to the yacht, stopped and very slowly bobbed up and down vertically 5 times. Obviously checking it out. Then apparently satisfied, slowly rolled over once and continued on her way. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1 pm --  orcas from the shore of Galiano Island.</b> - Karoline and Gary Cullen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We travelled out to <b>San Juan Island</b> to spot some members of <b>J-pod and L-pod</b>. The whales were everywhere! We were "surrounded by whales!" - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:10 am - J Pod orcas</b> are loud and clear on the <b>LK hydros</b>. Gosh, I love September. - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:13 -</b> Lots of <b>Orcas</b> here in <b>Eagle Cove</b>. - Judy Chovan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I came across <b>a group of California transients including CA172 and CA173 in the Juan de Fuca Strait.  The T035A's, T036A's and T038A were amongst one group. T011 and T011A showed up</b> from the American side of the Strait early evening and shadowed them as they continued west south of Jordan River. - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Over <b>18 Transients were found yesterday in the Juan de Fuca</b>. With at least<b> 8 CA transients</b> traveling with some of our regular transients. - Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:28pm - A whale (probably a humpback)</b> came up along side our sailboat and dove under it. Saw fluke two times as well as it headed south. We saw the whale just <b>south of Possession Pt</b> on Whidbey Island. - Joanne Donohue

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 26</font></b></center>
<br/>

A special treat today- <b>a few pacific white sided dolphins</b> (LAGS) heading up <b>the west side</b> (San Juan Island). A <b>minke</b> earlier, <b>humpbacks</b> yesterday and now LAGS. Sort of LOVE September. - Sandy Buckley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T038A traveling with the T035A's and T036A's north of Dungeness Spit in the afternoon</b>. They were originally found 2 miles south of Race Rocks in the morning tracking south east. - Photo by Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 PM - Humpback San Juan Channel.</b> We saw single Humpback feeding for an hour or more San Juan Channel/ Presidents Channel &amp; Limestone Point area. - Deb Batchelder

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just spotted <b>a humpback south of whidbey island</b> near <b>Point No Point</b>, maybe headed south....- Samuel HIlbert

<br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 25</font></b></center>
<br/>

The J17s were traveling in a close group with the three "rouge" K pod whales K16, K35, and K21. - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A member of J pod breaches near Pt. Roberts. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw what appeared to be <b>a humpback whale</b> this morning blowing and diving numerous times at <b>8:45 am off Point No Point</b> in Hansville, WA. Beautiful sight!! - Michelle LeMieux Hall

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>A humpback whale down just off San Juan Island</b> this morning and again in the afternoon, this time to the <b>southwest of Victoria</b>! - Prince of Whale Whale Watch

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 24</font></b></center>
<br/>

My boyfriend and I live on <b>John's Island</b> and just saw <b>a humpback</b> whale pass between <b>John's island and Flattop at 6:35 pm</b> this evening. - Marita Holdaway, John's island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw our good buddy <b>Split Fin, the humpback whale</b>, chilling around <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b>. He was most likely feeding because he was popping up all over the place and refused to pick a direction of travel. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

September 23-24 - <b>8:29 AM - Transient Female Sighting</b>. Have repeatedly seen a large transient female hunting the patch<b> between Speiden, Johns, and Stuart Islands</b> on 9/23 and 9/24. She was driving all the seals onto shore, and hunting the area between Gull Reef and Johns Island. For the past two days we have seen her on four separate occasions, circling around the area. - Andrew Clark

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Shortly after <b>3 PM orcas (Js and the three Ks)</b> were heading <b>north off Lime Kiln</b> while <b>a humpback whale (Split Fin) was heading south</b>. They easily passed within a couple hundred yards of each other, which is always cool to see! I could only capture a distant picture, but it's my first time photographing the two species up at the same time. While watching the humpback, who reportedly was doing the westside shuffle all day, we also saw Dall's porpoise and harbor seals, making for four marine mammal species in the span of a few minutes! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We encountered<b> J-pod at the south end of San Juan Island</b>. All the usual suspects were there including <b>Granny J2 and Blackberry J27</b>. These guys were traveling steadily north in tight family groups of 3 to 6. These dense collections of a few whales are ideal for viewing and provide valuable insight into how these whales organize themselves socially. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:31 -</b> Just heard some breaching or tail slapping on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> - no calls yet though for me! - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:14 AM - SRKWs vocalizing on Lime Kiln</b>. First heard a super faint call then waited to post until I heard a second (vocals continued for maybe a minute) and sounded possibly like Js but seriously was holding my laptop up to my ear. I have not heard any since and now the ship. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

Brad Hanson reports he is with <b>part of K pod off San Juan Island</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw around <b>100 Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> today! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>A humpback whale</b> was feeding in the shallows off of<b> San Juan Island</b>! This animal went unidentified, we didn't recognize him/her, but it was a small individual, doing short dives and fluking repeatedly! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 22</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>J27 Blackberry</b> in front of the <b>Vancouver BC</b> skyline. - Capt. Jim Maya.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J19 Shachi, 2 Granny and her adoptee L87 Onyx, east of Active Pass</b>. - Capt. Jim Maya.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J pod in the Strait of Georgia</b> were all separated into ones and twos but it was really different because each little group was very social! We spent a long time with <b>J22</b> and <b>J38</b> rubbing and vocalizing above the surface. We moved on to <b>J27</b> and <b>J31</b> after, who were acting very similar. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 - </b>reports of <b>resident killer whales way out west</b>. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 - 3 transient killer whales! The T010's</b>, a small family consisting of a mother and two sons. They were hanging out in the same bay around the corner from <b>Race Rocks</b> where we had the PWS dolphins, which were nowhere to be found. Smartly so, as they could have been on the menu otherwise! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Split Fin</b>, one of our favourite <b>humpbacks</b> was feeding in a massive bait ball off of<b> Trial Island</b>. And while we're waiting for him to resurface, what should appear, but a Minke whale! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We encountered about <b>100 Pacific white-sided dolphins in San Juan Channel </b>onboard the Victoria Clipper III! - Justine Buckmaster.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Pacific white-sided dolphins! A reported 40 dolphins</b>, feeding in a bay just around the corner from <b>Race Rocks</b>! And a HUGE pod of harbour porpoise (Jeff thinks over 100). - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

There were <b>80-100 Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> outside of Friday Harbor this afternoon. Screw football. Dolphins are WAY more awesome! - Katie Jones.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 21</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>L120 and L86 were off the south end of San Juan Island</b>! - Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>3:30 PM</b> I watched about <b>15 spread out whales</b> slowly heading south past<b> Land Bank and Hannah Heights</b>. A bit later, some of them were heading back north, but then they turned offshore and went towards another group heading east across Haro Strait. After a couple days of being very spread out between <b>Eagle Point and False Bay</b>, it seems like all the residents finally met up in a large group. There were easily <b>60 whales out there, and it could have been everybody!</b> They all grouped up about <b>5:45 PM</b> offshore of Hannah Heights, where they were milling but generally trending south. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A <b>humpback</b> seen from cottage deck on Cliffside Rd (near <b>E Point, Saturna</b>); whale was diving in Boundary Pass from about 3-6 pm on sunday, sept 21. I think it is rare to see a humpback in this vicinity. - James McLarnon, Vancouver.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpback BCY0409</b> (Yogi) was near <b>Kelp Reef</b> (Haro Strait). - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 20</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>J27 Blackberry</b> about to make a breathtaking close approach as we sat quietly. On his next breath he was 10-15 feet away. Off the <b>False Bay area</b> of San Juan Island. - James Gresham.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Turn Point</b> there were <b>J', K's and L's</b> I believe present. - Dick Snowberger.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Whales...Lime Kiln 10:35am.</b> - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 19</font></b></center>
<br/>

From <b>3:15 to 4:15</b> this afternoon we had a <b>mixed group of Js and Ks</b> slowly heading north past<b> Lime Kiln</b>. Another group had already passed by and were further north, and there were <b>more whales well to the south</b>. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orca mother and juvenile spotted off Grayland, WA</b>. My husband reports that yesterday while he was just off the Washington Coast, motoring in his sport fishing boat back to Westport, WA, on his way back from salmon fishing off the Long Beach peninsula, fairly close to shore he saw one female Orca and what he described as a "baby." He said it was noticeably smaller than the female. He is sure that the larger Orca was a female (curved dorsal), not a male (straight-edge dorsal). I don't know how common Transient juveniles are, so I thought I would report this sighting. They were traveling northbound. He saw both of them surface several times, before his boat outdistanced them. - Andrea Grad

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Tonight was another one of those beautiful nights in<b> Haro Strait with Resident Orcas</b> serenely searching for salmon. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until we happened across this <b>Minke whale </b>on the way home! Multiple breaches. Bow riding at 15 knots...insane! What a birthday present! - Lance Underwood

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:44am - </b>Sitting in <b>Rosario Strait</b>, between Blakely Island and Cypress Island watching <b>a gray whale </b>play and eat. - Peace Corey

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 18</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>10:27am - L12s (L87 Onyx) vocalizations.</b>
<b>10:00am - vocalizations and echolocation on Lime Kiln.</b> - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Everyone says it was <b>J pod group A and Onyx yesterday. And 3 Lags.</b> - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:45am - </b>Could hear <b>many blows</b> but couldn't see them in the fog. Traveling east to west. - Sally Reeve, <b>Flint Beach, Lopez Island</b>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L87 Onyx near False Bay.</b> - Sarah McCullagh, San Juan Safaris.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 17</font></b></center>
<br/>

Nothing beats a flat calm, overcast day for whale photography! What a day with <b>J pod (group A) </b>at the T10 buoy north of <b>Sand Heads</b> (mouth of the Fraser River). Lots of socializing and J49 was being a little goof bouncing around playing with everyone but lots of time with mom, J37, rolling around on top of her. Here are a few shots. The first is the J14's, second is L87, J19 and J2 and the last two are of J49 goofing around. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Mark went out west to find<b> resident killer whales</b> as they headed out towards<b> to the Pacific</b>. There were also some <b>Residents near Vancouver</b>. Ocean Magic picked up a few members of J-pod, most notably Granny's family! Her grandkids were enjoying excellent fishing. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Southern Resident orcas were heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. - Sooke Coastal Explorations.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Yesterday I spent a calm, still morning with a <b>Humpback Whale in Rosario Strait</b>. It was so lovely out, good thing whales don't care about rain. - Traci Walter.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 16</font></b></center>

Cappuccino (K21), with Southern Resident Killer Whales - <b>J Pod group B, K's and L's off Hein Bank</b>. - Connie Bickerton.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My first ever orca sighting....right place, right time...happened to have my camera.  Quite the blessing.
<b>12:45 PM -</b> Susan Skubina suggested I contact you. I was in my rowboat on the south side of the <b>Dungeness Spit</b> when I sighted <b>first one, then two orcas</b> cruising eastbound inside the bay. After passing by the light house and the tip of the spit they exited to the east. They appeared to be traveling (I like to think they were exploring). - Kip Tulin
<br/><i>Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research: It's T11 and T11A</i>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 PM - Approx 5 Orcas in Baynes Sound near Union Bay, B.C. (NW Georgia Strait) </b>a small pod of orcas ravelled up Baynes Sound. First observed a mother and calf, then they were joined by others include a large male, traveling, then feeding on a seal. Saw a fantastic spy hop. :-) Tons of seals in the shallows trying to avoid the carnage. - Bruce Evans

I tracked a group of California transients along with the <b>T037's</b> westbound out  the <b>Juan de Fuca Strait</b>.  I originally picked them up in the morning thanks to a tip from Seahawk Charters who spotted them south of Becher Bay.  I left them 3 miles offhsore of <b>Pt no Pt </b>in the afternoon when they led me to <b>J, K, and Lpod traveling east</b>  in a large resting formation a half mile to the north of them. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

We saw a group of transient killer whales, the <b>T060's off Orcas Island</b>. On the Victoria side, we were also looking at transients! We had a large group of about 15 spotted by skipper Mark on his first trip at 10am. Also on zodiacs were Bo and Matt today. It was a special treat to learn that one of the transient families was not one we see often; they're exotics! Not seen regularly - they were from California! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

We saw plenty of <b>transients just south of Race Rocks in the morning</b>, and even managed to see a humpback as it popped up amongst a resting transient pod on the afternoon trip.  Then we caught up with the same <b>T60 pod</b>, this time a little closer to home, only a few miles south of Victoria. The afternoon tours got to enjoy the sunshine with <b>humpbacks</b> and several transient killer whale pods, including the <b>T60s and T11s</b>, along with an unidentified transient group travelling with the <b>T11s</b>. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<b>A large group of transients, made up of the T060s, T036, T036B, T036B1, and the T109s were seen west of Secretary Island near Sooke, BC.</b> The whales appeared to be foraging before pushing off shore and becoming very surface active with many breaches reported. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

They found the <b>T065A's by Spieden Island</b> and spotted them hunting! They were traveling with another, unidentified group. Our photographer Marie is pretty sure one of the odd one's out was a lone female called T002! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

We traveled into Canadian water to see the <b>3 transient orcas</b>. I believe it was <b>White Rock</b> in the back if I recall correctly. I think there was a seal-hunt going on, several shots seemed to show whale with someone in the its mouth but most of them were too blurry to see clearly. - May Cheng

This afternoon from <b>12:15-1:15 I watched members of K-Pod</b> (at least the K13s and K14s) and <b>the L12 sub-group </b>go back and forth in front of <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> on San Juan Island. In the end, I believe Ks went north and L12s went south, but there were some very far away whales and a rain squall started to obscure the view! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island.

I have attached two photos of<b> L pod taken on the West Side</b> on yesterday's (9/2) very rainy tour.  Both photos were taken aboard the M/V Sea Lion. - Sarah McCullagh, San Juan Safaris.

Yes!!!<b> 2:00 Am and JPod </b>is on the <b>hydrophone</b>!! If this were winter I would be heading out there right now- luckily I'll be able to see them tomorrow hopefully. - Heather MacIntyre

<b>12:26am - Hearing orcas off of lime kiln hydrophone</b> now ...not sure who it is. - Emily White

When I saw this trio pop up together I had to do a double take. It was <b>Granny (J2), Mystery (L85), and Cali (K34)</b>. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.

I don't remember exactly how long it has been since I last saw resident killer whales, but it had been at least 20 years. Today I made up for lost time; <b>we might have seen every southern resident whale</b>. There were whales all across the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, from Vancouver Island to the Olympic Peninsula. We spent quality time with several dozen of them, and no other whale watching boat was in sight. - Photo by Bernardo Alps.

Today we caught up with <b>members of all three resident pods off Sooke, BC</b>. In the lead were the <b>J14s along with L22, L94, and L113</b>. Mystery (L85) and Cali (K34) were having some fun. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L85 Mystery</b> was an orphan at age 3, and was watched over by his brother <b>L38, 29 years old at the time</b>. He's now 23 years old. - Connie Bickerton.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My adopted whale <b>Scoter K25</b>. He still carries part of his satellite tag in his dorsal. Tagging is definitely controversial, but Scoter's tag lasted so long, he really helped provide a picture of K Pod travels after he was tagged in Dec 29, 2012. - Connie Bickerton.

<b>Almost 40 killer whales at Point no Point in Canada near Sooke</b> today! - Sooke Coastal Explorations

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

In the <b>afternoon there were over 40 whales out together including members of J, K and L pod!</b> They were spread out through the Juan de Fuca strait and were acting very playful, seems like they were happy to be reunited. The<b> T's were getting very close</b> to the residents which is rare, in the past the two have given each other a wide birth. - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transients</b> were encountered in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca near Becher Bay</b>. Individuals were ID'ed as <b>T034, T034A</b>, and some (but not all) members of the T037 matriline. Initially the whales were heading west with five to six respirations followed by a longer dive with a 3-4 minute downtime. Before we left them they had changed directions and were heading southeast towards Port Angeles, WA. - The Transient Killer Whale Research Project

We saw <b>two Orcas on the 330p ferry yesterday between Pt Townsend and Coupeville</b>! The ferry riders were thrilled! - Teri Butorac Ferren

So we had a very nice group of <b>Bigg's Killer Whales</b> that Ivan Reiff found in the morning known as the <b>T18s</b>. Easiest to spot in this group is a big male named <b>T19B</b>, affectionately known as "Mr. Floppy Fin". Morning trip he made a very quick and efficient kill of a harbor seal, and in the afternoon, made this beautiful spyhop near Bellingham Channel. - John Boyd.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transient Sighting in Bellingham Channel</b>. We came upon what I believe to be <b>T18, T19, T19B, T19C</b> on the northwest side of<b> Cypress Island</b>. We were cruising along and realized there was a line-up of whale watching vessels looking right where we were! We moved out of the way just in time for them to come through. They seemed to be in travel mode and moved quite swiftly. They traveled north around Cypress and into Bellingham Channel <b>between Guemes and Cypress Islands</b>, heading towards Anacortes, before we parted ways with them. - Kamriell Welty

 The <b>tranients at Race Rocks were identified as the T34's and T37 B's.</b> The whales were going for both seals and harbor porpoise so there was a ton of action going on! - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<b>9:47 -</b> At <b>Norwegian Point</b> (by Hansville) now! - Elyse Sollitto

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:46 - </b>They are <b>heading North</b>. We just saw them. I think it's the transient group that were spotted yesterday. Amazing! - Tina Marohn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:30 - We saw them across from Mutiny Sands</b>. - Sandy Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:30 - </b>Looks like maybe they have made a kill - lots of surface activity and splashing and hanging out in one spot.
<br/><b>11:16 - </b>Right by the midchannel marker <b>between Mutiny Bay and Skunk bay</b> They've moved a little south after that cargo ship passed.
<br/><b>11:09 - </b> Actually they're pretty stationary. Breaches, spyhops, tail slaps in one area.
<br/><b>11:05 -</b> Found them. We are at that point on the <b>south end of Mutiny bay</b>. Still heading north. - Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 am</b> from Whidbey - saw <b>distant blows over on the Kitsap side</b>, still heading north. - Sandra Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11 am -</b> <b>Trending NW t</b>oward entrance to Hood Canal, coming up on Foulweather Bluff now.
<br/><b>9:48 -</b> Visual confirmation. I saw blows a mile or so north of Point No Point, trending NNW up Admiralty Inlet. - Howard Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:17 am - </b>Whales are at<b> point no point </b>right now! Do not know direction of travel. Presumably heading north. Coast guard just notified a mariner over marine radio. - Dianne Dee Iverson
