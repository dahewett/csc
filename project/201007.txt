<b>July 2010</b>
<br/>Orca Network received a call from Cliff Ryer of NOAA Fisheries at Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR. He was off <b>Kodiak, AK</b> last week and observed a pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> attacking a mom and calf <b>humpback</b> pair, resulting in the death of the calf. The calf was found and towed to shore for a necropsy by NOAA Fisheries, and Cliff has photographs of the orcas so hopefully we'll get some IDs of them at some point soon.

<br/><br/>
In response to Lori Schneider's report from her trip on the <b>afternoon </b>off the west side of<b> S.J.</b> in the fog, she saw <b>L87, J27, the J17's, and the K14's</b> in the fog.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria
<br/>*<br/> 
Kurt and I went out with Prince of Whales on the Ocean Magic II out of Victoria last Saturday <b>afternoon</b>. It was very foggy - we did see lots of whales off the south end of <b>San Juan Island</b>, but the crew were not able to say anything more definitive than "resident orcas." There were several mom/baby pairs and a few big males, with numerous spy hops and tail slaps, and a couple of very close passes near the boat.
<br/>Lori Schneider, Port Angeles, WA
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>1152 </b>PT at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>, I heard multiple <b>S-17 call</b> along with what sounded like S-33 only in a lower octave. Sounded like a "giggle". 
<br/>Dawn Trybjorn, Seattle 
<br/><br/>
<b>July 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Was out with Jim Maya with several <b>orcas </b>feeding and foraging in fog, so predicting where they were going to go was difficult. We were about mile off <b>San Juan Island</b>. Suddenly one emerged coming straight toward us and I got a series of head-on shots before it dove. It is dramatic from low on the water.
<br/>Chuck Bergman, Professor, Department of English, Pacific Lutheran University 
<br/>*<br/>
A short <b>lunch time</b> whale parade through <b>Active Pass</b>. Six whales, going against the tide, with some spy hops, half breaches, and tail slaps (will post photos in future reports).
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Awakened to loud clear <b>calls </b>this morning <b>6:00 am</b> heard on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> - 
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Key Largo, Florida
<br/>*<br/>
He had <b>Southern Resident orcas</b> off <b>Eagle Pt</b>., False Bay and Edwards Pt, Land Bank, W. San Juan Island, breaching and kelping in the fog.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, San Juan Island 
<br/><br/>
<b>July 29, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
After receiving reports of whales coming down from <b>Turn Point</b>, center staff Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit and Emma Foster departed in Shachi. The water conditions were very rough with a lot of chop and wind waves. <b>K12, K43 and K37</b> were the first group encountered (at <b>2:57 p.m</b>. - 48° 58.37 N; 123° 20.31 W). K26 was seen breaching several times. The next group encountered was a mixed group containing <b>K14, K42, J1, J2, J19, K12, K43, K37</b> and others. We also saw <b>J33 and J36 close to J26, J16 and J42</b> who were also traveling together. The final group encountered was <b>K13, K20, K38, K34 and K25</b>. All whales were traveling quickly south. There were reports of more whales off Turn Point but due to rough conditions and incoming fog we ended the encounter still off Kellett Bluff (48° 58.436 N; 123° 20.31 W) at <b>3:52 p.m</b>.

Jim Maya had <b>Southern Resident orcas</b> at <b>Tumbo Is. BC</b>, breaching; 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca <b>calls </b>at <b>Lime Kiln</b>, 4<b>:29, 6:03 and 9:31 pm</b>.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L94 with L113</b> off of <b>French Beach, Vancouver Island</b> in the <b>morning </b>heading west.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
As we neared Stuart Island the orca whales were traveling south down <b>Haro Strait</b>. We traveled parallel to the direction they were heading along the west side of San Juan Island. We identified J-1 "Ruffles", J-16 "Slick", and J-30 "Riptide". There are 28 members of the <b>J-pod</b>, with 4 new calves in the last year. The whales were active today; we observed a few breaches and a lot of tail slapping. 
<br/>Sally, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
Lots of <b>orcas </b>southbound along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> this <b>afternoon</b>. I managed to get a few photos from shore before the fog covered the water like a thick blanket.
<br/>Jane Cogan 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca <b>calls </b>were reported off<b> OrcaSound hydrophone</b> (NW San Juan Island) at <b>3:30 pm</b> by Jeff Hogan - he had <b>J's and K's</b> headed south, S1 and S16 calls on Lime Kiln, also in front of the Center for Whale Research. A large group of orcas, possibly <b>L pod</b>, was headed west past Sooke this morning. 
I am just beginning to hear a few calls off Lime Kiln now, at <b>4:10</b>.
<br/>Susan Berta, Orca Network 
<br/>*<br/>
There was a <b>gray whale</b> feeding just south of the <b>Fauntleroy </b>dock this morning about <b>9 AM</b> putting on quite a show for those waiting for the ferry.
<br/>Sheila Helgath, PhD, WSF Environmental Program Manager
<br/>*<br/>
Donna Sandstrom called this morning to report that they had also observed a baleen whale with a heart-shaped blow (sounds like <b>a Gray</b>) while watching the <b>Transients </b>off <b>Restoration Pt.</b> 7/28 The Transients were heading N while the Gray whale was heading S. Then Karol Sample saw the Gray whale from Me-Kwa-Mooks park in <b>W. Seattle</b> this morning (7/29) at <b>11 am</b>, heading north. She said it appeared to be a juvenile, so it is likely not the same Gray that had stranded off of Everett earlier in the month. 
<br/><br/>
<b>July 28, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
On a return trip from Victoria, B.C. Ken Balcomb encountered <b>J's K's and L's</b> heading North. The encounter began at <b>11:35a.m</b>. just south of Lime Kiln State Park (48° 50.367 N; 123° 14.466 W). The encounter ended in <b>Boundary Pass</b> (48° 71.271 N; 123° 24.345 W) at <b>3:08 p.m</b>. 
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
While heading to the Olympic Peninsula and Southworth, just after departing the Fauntleroy ferry in <b>West Seattle</b> @<b> 1:49PM</b>. I stopped and looked back towards Lincoln Park's, Coleman Pool and noticed a dorsal fin &amp; multiple blows. There appeared to be 1 male dorsal fin and at least 2 females. I observed them for several minutes with binoculars, then lost then completely. They may have been feeding in the tidal rip that occurs off the point very near Coleman Pool.
<br/>Jeffrey W. Crow, Seattle 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:08 a.m.</b> a few <b>L pod</b> calls on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>. 4:00 a.m. calls of all three pods on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b> - some L pod whales had been south and <b>J, K and some Ls</b> were coming back down from the north. They passed by <b>Lime Kiln</b> starting at about <b>4:30 a.m.</b> At <b>11:00 a.m.</b> they began coming back up island. It was truly a full <b>superpod </b>because today the L-2s were with all the rest of the Community, whereas the other day they did not join them but stayed to the south. Baby K-43 was in the lead with mom Sequim K-12 as they passed by at the park. The pass by ended at about 3:00 pm. with Js and Ks and some Ls going north and most of Ls going back south.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>afternoon </b>reports were in. There were ten to fifteen orca [<b>orcas</b>] spotted near <b>Stuart Island</b>. We traveled north and encountered the orcas near Turn Point. The whales were traveling very close together, heading north towards Pender Bluffs on South Pender Island. The highlight of today's trip was when an adult breached about 250 yards away from our boat. 
<br/>Naturalist, Sally, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
This <b>morning </b>the whales came porpoising down the straits breaching and lunging against what appeared to be a very strong tide and choppy waves- the display lasted for about an hour and a half. Now that the fog has broken up a bit on the west side (<b>11:15am</b>) close to shore, there are at least four large lines of resting whales in separate groups slowly making their way back up the island. Given the antics from 5-6:30 this morning, it is no surprise they needed a rest!"
<br/>Sandy Buckley, <b>San Juan Island</b>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:38 am</b>: Hearing <b>calls </b>on the <b>limekiln </b>- yelled at my dog at first thinking it was him whining :-) 11:44am Good Lord they're loud! I think they found the hydrophone. 
<br/>Princess NellsBells (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:37am</b>: Faint <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophone</b> right now. <b>11:14am</b> - Calls are getting louder now.
<br/>Andrew Lees (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson reported hearing <b>calls </b>on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at <b>8:24 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
S19 <b>calls </b>and clicks (<b>L pod</b>) first on <b>Orcasound </b>and then <b>Lime Kiln</b> in the wee hours (<b>0104-0138</b>).
They (So Residents) are really working the west side today. Erick reported hearing them at Lime Kiln at 12:05, plus autodetections just came in (from 11:44 - 12:09), most recently from Orcasound. Nice whistles at Lime Kiln &amp; Great S7s and S4 at Orcasound!
Lots of automated detections of S2 and other calls and clicks on Orcasound and Lime Kiln between 0359 and 0551.
<br/>Scott Veirs, OrcaSound/Beam Reach 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>off Yeomalt Beach off <b>Bainbridge Island</b>, heading north! Posted at ~ <b>9 pm</b>.
<br/>Erika Seidel Thompson (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6pm</b>. Northbound Pod of <b>Orca</b>, I counted 6. One very large male, 2 calves and three or four Midsize - perhaps two females. The Sun was bright around 6pm when I spotted them. I was Westbound in my 17 foot Cuddy heading to Skiff Point for fishing (just South of <b>Point Monroe</b>, say three-4 miles. The whales were in 300 feet of water cruising North along Eastshore of Bainbridge Is. There was a Science Skiff vessel with three people on board and a camera just following along. Whales were on surface for some time and then deep for a spell before back on top. No breaching or play time for them, just touring along.
<br/>Mark
<br/>*<br/>
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries got out with the <b>Transients </b>off <b>Seattle </b>today, they were unable to obtain any fecal samples, but did get some photographs so hopefully we'll have IDs of these whales shortly. They observed 4 orcas, including 1 male - at 6 pm they were heading N off <b>Pt. Monroe, NE Bainbridge Island</b>. 
<br/><i>The following whales (Transient orcas) were ID'd: <b>T101, T101A, T101B, and T102</b>. - Candi Emmons, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle 
</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4 Transients</b> - male with a lean to the right and 3 others East side of <b>Bainbridge Is</b>. going North at <b>1746</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called to relay a report from a friend on the <b>N. Vashon Island</b> ferry who had seen 3 <b>orcas </b>from the ferry, heading west - including a male, female &amp; a calf, closer to the Vashon side.
<br/>*<br/>
John Rogstad with WA State Ferries called at <b>1 pm</b> to report 1 <b>orca </b>had been sighted from the Kitsap ferry on the <b>Seattle-Bremerton</b> run, 1.5 miles off Alki Pt. heading S/SW. He called back at 2 pm to report 3, possibly 4 orcas sighted from the ferry Tillicum, southbound off Fauntleroy in the Northbound traffic lane.
<br/>*<br/>
Donna Sandstrom of the Whale Trail reported watching the pod of <b>Transients mid-afternoon</b> from Marine View Drive in <b>W. Seattle</b>. The whales had been traveling south, but turned north and at around 4:10 pm were off Alki, mid-channel heading north. They also observed a baleen whale with a heart-shaped blow (sounds like a <b>Gray whale</b>) at one point - see rest of that report under Gray whales.
<br/>*<br/>
Three <b>Orcas </b>were sighted by the captain and passengers; mid channel headed south at <b>12:30</b> on the <b>Bainbridge to Seattle WSF ferry</b>. The WSF vessel captain announced their presence and passengers got a show as the whales passed in front of the bow (ferry had slowed to allow them to pass). They were followed by a seal. One was a large male and two smaller animals.
<br/>Sheila Helgath, PhD, WSF Environmental Program Manager
<br/>*<br/>
Passengers on the ferry had a real treat seeing [<b>orcas</b>] this <b>afternoon </b>on the way from <b>bainbridge to seattle</b>! a highlight of my vacation for sure! my daughter and my niece were "pretending" to be whale watching from the moment we got on the ferry to bainbridge, so they really manifested their magical thinking! : )
<br/>Jennifer DeTrempe Golden (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson reported <b>Transient orcas</b> at <b>11:45 am</b> N of Elliott Bay, <b>Seattle</b>, heading south. At 1 pm he said there were 2 males, 2 females and a juvenile, they were south of the Seattle ferry lanes, heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
Spotted 4-5 <b>orcas </b>from the <b>Kingston-Edmonds ferry</b> this morning around <b>8:10 AM</b>. They were in the middle of the sound heading south, with at least 1 large male in the group.
<br/>Tim J. Hammermeister
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Killer whales</b> around <b>ripple rock BC</b> today (north of Campbell River, in Seymour Narrows, Johnstone Strait).
<br/>Florent Nicolas (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
Perry Edwards of BC called Orca Network to report he and Charlie Fleischer on the MV Saltchuck were observing a very large pod of <b>dolphins </b>at <b>3:20 pm</b> at Lock Bay, NE <b>Gabriola Island BC</b>, heading north toward Entrance Island (49 11.819N; 123 47.85W). They were very playful, jumping clear of the water, with gray to white sides on the dorsal fins and gray striping down the sides of the body, and a whiter belly - in consulting his field books he is pretty sure they were Pacific White Sided dolphins. 
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
July 26
Center staff woke to whale blows just before 7am and departed in both vessels, Shachi and Orca. Most of J's, K's and L's were encountered in small social groups, from 8:13 am - 12:25 pm. Shachi spent the majority of the encounter off Kellett Bluff, beginning with L47, L83, L91 and L110 in a tight group. Later L5, L84, L54, L100, L108, L82, L55, L86, L106, L112, L103 and L109 were encountered before coming across a social group containing J1, K20, K38, J19, J41, J27, J31, J39, L41, L85 and others. Other mixed groups were also encountered, including one group that was pushing around a young calf. Orca began their encounter with the L12s, but were quickly left behind as they porpoised towards the larger group, they also encountered a large number of mixed groups and later found the L2's on the west side of San Juan.

<br/><br/>
Arlene Solomon of Mayne Island, BC called at <b>2:12 pm</b> to report 12 <b>orcas </b>heading into <b>Active Pass</b>, the pod included 2 large males, and they seemed to be fishing. 
<br/>*<br/>
A stop off in <b>Presidents Channel</b> to see a <b>minke </b>(he's been in the same area for nearly a week now) was just the cherry on top of our great day on the water. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince 
<br/>*<br/>
The day was welcomed in with 69 degrees, sunny skies and blows of <b>whales </b>echoing off the absolutely flat, calm seas at <b>6:00 am</b> this morning. Before the whales made it into my sights I could see salmon literally jumping out of the water - which was interesting in and of itself. Slowly, members of <b>J and L pod</b> began passing close to shore- very spread out. I made my way to the <b>(Lime Kiln) lighthouse</b> hoping there would be a close pass. As I watched the whales near me, I could also see a lot of fins far offshore, some apparently heading in around Discovery and keeping to the Canadian side of the Haro Straits. I watched J's pass by intermingled with L's but then I see <b>a smattering of K's</b> in the groups as they continued to pass. It took about 30 minutes for the show to end - not a lot of activity but a few very close passes at the shoreline. 
I actually left the park and made it to landbank only to see a sight that made me stop in my tracks and return to the park. Just in time - a resting line of nearly 15 whales came by the shorelines, including Mega, Skana, Solstice, Calypso, Mystery, Canuck, Spirit---and another 6 I never even had a chance to see (wrong lens for wide angle shots)! But definitely a naptime for L pod!
<br/>Sandy Buckley, Postcards From Friday Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
<b>K Pod</b>, who had been "summering" for the last month or so up in the Queen Charlotte's had appeared near <b>Lime Kiln</b>! For the first time this summer, we had all 3 pods together---a SUPER POD! They were making good time with a flood tide pushing them north, and we managed to catch up to the trailing group of about 20+ whales about 3 miles east of Eastpoint. The whales were working hard through the large rip tide at Boiling Reef, and we gave them extra room through the area so they could go where they wanted. Soon we were on the other side in much calmer waters, and the whales became more and more active as they got further from the strong rip. We saw K21 Cappucino swimming fairly close to L41 Mega. It was good to the see the big boys back in the area. We also had some Js in the mix. Soon K21 &amp; L41 began swimming upside down with their enormous pectoral fins out of the water. It was so cool to be able to point out the large curl in their tail flukes. Soon this was followed by breaches, spyhops, cartwheels. It was amazing. It was as if one whale would try to "one-up" the activity of the others. The big treat for us was to see a mother and calf breach side by side at the same time about 250 yards away!!!

I was pleasantly surprised to see a <b>Gray Whale</b> between Roberts Creek and Davis Bay on the <b>Sunshine Coast of BC</b>. I watched it moving north. It appeared active and healthy, taking several long dives and resting momentarily at the surface after each one.

Update on the for search for Everett Gray whale that had stranded earlier this month:
I just wanted to let you know that I was out flying, Saturday (24th) in the evening about 6:30 PM, Sunday about 5 PM and Monday at 6:30 and at none of these times have I seen the gray whale that's been near Everett. Maybe it's headed off??

I believe I saw an <b>orca </b>whale following a female <b>gray whale</b> and her baby off the coast at <b>Point Arena, California</b> this weekend. We were watching a female gray and her baby feeding right off the coastline-they were heading north. I was looking thru my binoculars and was able to see the distinct black straight dorsal fin as it swam around the gray in a playful? manner.

Early Sunday <b>evening</b>, aboard the Island Explorer 3 we encountered part of <b>L-Pod</b> making their way to <b>Kellett Bluff</b>. We saw Crewser, Bellena, Alexis, Racer, Nigel, Mystery, Skana, Solstice, Baba, Spirit, Fluke and possibly Ocean Sun. The water was calm, the sun was warm and with the Bluff in the background it was quite a sight to see.

This <b>morning </b>aboard the Western Prince around <b>11:30 AM</b> we met up with some very spread out <b>L-Pod</b> whales off of <b>Eagle Point</b>. We spent some time with the L47s and also saw L95 as they slowly made their way north.
For our <b>afternoon </b>trip we headed north and met up with <b>J-Pod</b> as they were passing Turn Point and crossing <b>Boundary Pass</b> around 3:30 PM. We followed them towards the Pender Islands where the continued to make their way north along the shoreline. I saw for sure <b>J1, J2, J8, J19, J41, and the J14</b> family group. When I got home and looked at my photos I was surprised to see some L-Pod whales in there as well - definitely L12, L22, and L79 and likely some others.
One other sighting of note was a pair of <b>Dall's porpoise</b> in Boundary Pass while J-Pod was crossing. Like last year, they have been a rare sight during the summer months!

<br/>*<br/>
After watching mixed groups of <b>J's and L's</b> pass by the <b>Center for Whale Research</b>, both vessels departed Snug Harbor at 2:30 pm. The whales were split in two loose groups. Shachi caught up with the first group just off Kellett Bluff (48° 59.867 N; 123° 22.281 W) at <b>2:39 pm</b> and Orca went north to <b>Turn Point</b> to reach the leading group.

Arlene Solomon of Mayne Island, B.C. called to report that <b>4 orcas</b> went by &amp; headed into <b>Active Pass </b>at <b>6:15 pm</b>, including 1 large male - lots of fishing, leaping &amp; breaching - she called back at 6:25 pm &amp; said <b>9 more orcas</b> were heading through Active Pass.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:30 am</b>- Large number of <b>orcas </b>just cruised past the south end of <b>Lopez</b>, probably about 20 with footprints of whales all over the area. Orcas were traveling slowly, going to the west, in small groups of 1 to 3. Sunshine, blue calm water, Olympics in the distance, some breaches, no boats in sight. 
<br/>Sally Reeve, Lopez Island
<br/>*<br/>
Four orcas (possibly 5) were sighted in Discovery Passage near Whiskey Point on Quadra Island, BC at 6:30 PST today. Whiskey Point is across from <b>Campbell River</b>. They were heading South toward to the southern tip of Quadra Island at Cape Mudge and the start of the Strait or Georgia. They were with the flood tide. There did not appear to be a predominant dorsal fin seen amongst the small group.
A commercial inflatable whale watching boat was very close to the group and will hopefully provide you with more detail. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.09'; W 125° 12.93'.

We were so excited to observe approximately <b>20 Orcas</b> passing by <b>Point Roberts</b> between <b>5:30 and 7 pm</b>. The whales were quite spread out, heading South, and moving steadily in pairs. A few of the whales were swimming back and forth with some tail lobbing. There were at least three large males present; we also spotted two calves swimming/frolicking together. Thank you!

Sunshine Coast BC (North of Vancouver) <b>Grays - 05:56:</b> Out of the silence: the blow of a <b>Grey Whale</b>! the same distance from shore as we were, about 50 meters close !! Not a leisurely swim anymore now, back to the shore as fast we could - this Grey Whale was considerably larger than the one we could observe here a few times in the course of 2 weeks, so this, I assume, was a female; also outline of body is rounder, smoother; and the movements while feeding was very different.

The <b>grey whale</b> has gone past our house (<b>Roberts Creek BC area</b>) heading east both yesterday and the day before (July 20 and 21), both times late in the <b>afternoon</b>. This one has a piece missing from the corner of its tail so it is easy to identify. I also saw it at Davis Bay in the early morning of July 20. As it went by our house, it appeared to be digging into the sandy bottom with its nose as a large amount of sand would come up each time it surfaced. Sounds like it's feeding - ON At the same time yesterday, there was a single spotted sandpiper on the beach.

We approached <b>J-pod</b> traveling South near Pender Bluffs on <b>So. Pender Island</b>. Immediately I identified "Ruffles" with his infamously tall and wavy dorsal fin. We counted at least twelve orcas! They traveled in a close knit group, synchronizing their breathes. Watching them breathe in unison is meditative.

Orca Network received a call from Raese Reeves of WDFW, relaying a report he heard from some fishermen out of Seiku, WA, who had observed "a whole bunch" of <b>orcas attacking a Gray whale off Swiftsure Bank</b>. He gave us the number of Van Riper's Resort where the fishermen were staying, and we talked to one of the fishermen, JR Allen, who was on the boat, along with Rich Schuler. It was in the <b>morning</b>, 32 miles beyond Swiftsure (48 33.075N; 124 53.485W), in 10' seas. They were in a small fishing boat, when they saw 20 - 25 orcas, and a gray whale. The orcas were going after the Gray, 6 males getting in a line and ramming the Gray, which made "the damndest noise - like a hurt bull" when they rammed it. The Gray moved over next to the boat to try to escape the orcas, which put the boat in the middle of the action &amp; suddenly they were surrounded by orcas trying to attack the gray whale, so they were trying to get out of there! As they were leaving, one of the orcas came up behind the boat and followed them for awhile. They were able to get about 9 minutes of video and will make a copy of it and send to us when he gets back home to Idaho next week. We'll let you know if the video enables any IDs of the Orcas or the Gray whale.

As one of our naturalists Lauren mentioned yesterday the whales have been testing our reach lately and today was no different. This morning they cruised quickly up the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> continuing to head north. By the time we headed out of the harbor the reports were saying they were at Turn Point off of Stuart Island. We finally caught up to them at <b>North Pender Island </b>in Canada. Other whale watch boats could be seen up ahead but before we made it that far one of our guests spotted some Orcas off our port side. As we watched this group of five we identified them as the grouping known as the <b>J16's</b>. This group consists of a female J16 and her 4 offspring. While they mostly traveled they occasionally made us ooo and ahhhh with a tail slap and even a few cartwheels. The fog from the morning had cleared and the whales slowly surfaced making for some nice kodak moments.

Veronica von Allworden of Sky and Sea Photography, and Orca Network volunteer, called to report she had done a fly-over of the Everett area and found the <b>Gray whale</b> near <b>Everett</b>. 
She then sent us this report: 
I finally found the gray whale again at about <b>5 PM</b> today. It was in a shallow area west of the Large Marine marker that is on the edge of the drop off west of Everett and north of <b>Hat (Gedney) Island</b>. The whale was lying on the bottom just coming up to breathe. It did not feed or swim in the 15 minutes that I photographed it. The whale had some pink patches on its back above the flippers. Looked like sea lice, possibly on wounds. It's difficult to say if this was the same whale that I photographed last month. Today's whale spent very little time on the surface and it's hard to get accurate pictures through the water. Today's whale seemed to have more white on its fluke and pink patches on it's back compared to the gray that I photographed on 6/23/10 (we agree - after looking at Veronica's photos of the Gray whale she photographed in June, the flukes on this one definitely look different - ON). There were quite a few boats in the vacinity- none of which seemed to be aware that the whale was there.

We just saw on KIRO News a video they took at around <b>2 pm</b> this afternoon of the <b>Gray whale</b> swimming toward a small boat setting out a large fishing net - they were on a collision course, when suddenly the boat saw the whale and revved up, taking in the net to avoid the whale, while at the same time the whale made a 90 degree turn to avoid the boat and net - whew!!! The good news is that in this video the whale appeared to be swimming quite well, and wasn't stationary, as in the above report - ON

We had a two part whale sighting in <b>Active Pass</b>. The first group, with <b>Mr. Ruffles (J1)</b> bringing up the rear, came through around <b>11:30</b>. They came very close to our shoreline, swimming sideways (see photo of the day, above) and snuffling in the kelp. The second group, more active with many tail slaps and breaches, came through around 1 pm.

<b>8 pm-8:30 pm</b> - been watching the <b>gray whale</b> blowing off Harborview Park in <b>Everett </b>- same area where he beached himself twice last week. He's not rolling like last week - mostly blows. Seeing his fins just a little. 
<b>9:02 pm</b> - just lost sight of him headed east toward Howarth Park and port of Everett. Good to see him!

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales and SoundWatch was with <b>J's and L's</b> from <b>10 am to about 5 pm</b>, from Salmon Bank to False Bay, San Juan island.
<br/>*<br/> 
Reaching the middle of July, summer in the <b>San Juans</b> is really in full swing. Today we spotted members of the <b>J and L-pods</b> near Eagle Point on <b>San Juan Island</b>. As we neared their location we could hear the impressively loud blows of the orcas' exhale. Large clouds of mist shot above the surface. Captain Craig lowered our hydrophone into the water, allowing us to hear them communicate below the surface. Each of the pods speak their own dialect. On average, each of the pods have ten separate types of calls.

We had reports of <b>orcas </b>on the south side, but weren't sure they would come our way as we headed north in more comfortable waters, sighting bald eagles, harbor porpoise, harbor seals, and marine birds along the way. As we rounded to the west, <b>J-Pod</b> families, with J-2 Granny, classically in the lead, displayed many of the behaviors we had been talking about, as if on cue! Our guests were delighted, and our timing spot on, for the smoothest conditions and seeing the whales! We also had quite a few children on board and since these killer whales are listed as endangered I asked a group if they knew what 'endangered' meant. One little girl thought for a moment and said "that means they need something". What a great response. Yes, these whales need Chinook salmon, clean water, and our care and respect! Little J-45 Se-Yi'-Chn, capped off our trip with four consecutive breaches! The day was filled with hope and magic.

Fortunately for us, by the time we got out to the west side of <b>San Juan</b> to view the whales, the winds had abated somewhat and the seas were fairly calm. Just in time to see our wonderful whales of <b>J-Pod</b>. We thought we only had one or two whales near Kellett Bluff and so we waited to see who else might be around when suddenly the waters fairly sprouted 8-10 more whales that had been on a long dive! <b>J1 </b>Ruffles was once again leading the pack, right next to <b>J2 </b>Granny (what a good son!) We also saw J19 and her calf, J30 (a sprouter male that is getting huge!), <b>J27 </b>Blackberry, <b>J8 </b>Speiden (with her small dorsal fin and very distinctive blow!) The whales didn't seem to be in much of a hurry, and spent their time searching the tidal rips for something to munch on, and play around with each other. Soon we found ourselves just north of the Turn Point Lighthouse in the very cool upwellings, and we waited for the whales to arrive. And waited. And waited. And as I like to say on the boat, patience is usually rewarded, and boy was it! The whales had been fairly spread out before the lighthouse, and maybe it was the strong currents, but soon we had 12-15 whales coming up in a large group! A few cartwheels (by the whales, not the naturalists) were followed by some huge pectoral fin slaps by none other than J1 Ruffles! And then little J45 decided he'd show Ruffles how to do some pretty impressive breaches (4 of them to be exact)--full height followed by a landing on the belly! It was the perfect ending to a picture-perfect summer day.

In the late evening light we watched another group, perhaps the C6s, adjust themselves into the back eddy close to hanson Island. They finally made way towards Johnstone Strait.

Brent Norberg of NOAA Fisheries (who had earlier this week been in the water with the stranded gray whale) was out crabbing on Sunday, and who should swim past him but the <b>Gray whale</b> he helped rescue?! He was <b>between Tulalip Bay and S. Camano Island</b>, near Spee-Bi-Dah, and the whale seemed headed toward Port Susan, around <b>4 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
On a lighthouse tour this afternoon we came across <b>L Pod</b> members cruising north along Stuart and on past Turn Point at <b>1700</b>. They seemed to be in high spirits with the major tidal rips and upwellings off Turn Pt. Among others, not identified, we espied <b>L- 12,22,25,41,72,78,79,93,105,113</b>.
On our am trip, <b>J1 </b>was surfing in the six foot swells as he came across Haro Strait arriving at the county park around about 1030. We also saw J2 and others inshore. It was so dramatic out there this morning with big swells, 20 knots SW wind, fog curtain rising and falling, sun silvered seas and surfing whales!

We were passing through <b>Speiden Channel</b> and fortunately for us, the whales decided to head in that same direction, and we found a nice group of whales just north of Battleship Island. Even from 1/2 mile away, we were able to pick out <b>J1 Ruffles</b>. Our passengers were amazed that I could ID a whale from that far away-well, until I told them how I did it. That dorsal fin is mighty distinctive. And soon we were close enough that they could see his wavy fin, along with Granny <b>J2's </b>nicked dorsal fin. Following behind J1 &amp; J2 were about 6-8 more individuals, and we were privileged enough to see several breaches (see Photo of the Day, above), tail lobs, and a spyhop. Our <b>afternoon </b>trip had us in a quandry as we had two groups of whales within our reach. The whales made were right between <b>Kellett Bluff and Stuart Island</b>, in fairly calm waters. It was amazing. We had the <b>L32s</b> and <b>L12s</b> foraging in the currents. At one time we had 4 whales tail-lobbing at the same time. Lots of back and forth directional changes. And even better, the sun was shining and the waters were fairly calm. But best of all, it was like we were having our own private wildlife experience as we were the only boat with this group. I think in the hour we were on-scene, the whales moved less than 1/2 mile total. We saw <b>L85, L79, L41, L12, L25</b> all working the current lines. Several breaches, including one by L79 (I'm about 80% sure), spyhops, and tons of tail lobs. Too soon it was time to head back to reality, and we were all happy and content to have shared some time with these amazing creatures.

At about <b>11 am</b>, we received an email from Ray Fryberg of the Tulalip Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, saying the <b>gray whale</b> had re-stranded in <b>Tulalip Bay</b> on the Tulalip Reservation. Tulalip police, NOAA volunteers, and others worked to keep the whale wet and covered from the sun with a wet sheet, and stayed with it while the tide came back up. Ray Fryberg's daughter and Granddaughter went out in a canoe and sang a healing song to the whale. The whale was free floating by around <b>2 pm</b>, but not really going anywhere. Then at <b>4:15 pm</b> the whale had turned and headed out of Tulalip Bay, toward Camano Island.

<b>1:30 pm</b> here at <b>Tulalip Bay, Gray</b> now completely submerged. Periodic movement, surfacing and weak spouts. Amazing, since we saw it last night at Harborview park, Everett at 7:30pm. Quite a process. Glad it is in a quiet, peaceful area. 
<br/>And an update: Shortly after my last email from Tulalip Bay, the water was deep enough for the whale to move around and then started swimming at a good pace towards the opening between the shore and shoal. It got stuck again for a bit on the shoal but eventually made it's way around and into deeper water. We left at 3:00 and it was finally on a clear path out of the bay. What a very spiritual experience.

This afternoon aboard the Western Explorer around <b>1:00 PM</b> we met up with J-Pod<b></b> and the few K-Pod<b></b> whales that have been traveling with them. They were between <b>East Point and Point Roberts</b>, at first heading towards Boundary Pass and then turning and heading back north. I was able to positively ID <b>K21, K40, J32, J34, and J38</b>. I don't know what has gotten into these whales lately (hopefully lots and lots of Chinook salmon!) but on my encounters with them over the last week it seems like they have been especially active. Today was no exception as we saw breach after breach. It sure is good to see them spending so much time in the inland waters lately!

'Mystic Sea' sighted members of the <b>Southern Residents</b> (believed to be <b>L pod and possibly K21, Cappucino</b>) well spread out in the <b>Strait of Georgia off Point Roberts</b> around <b>1.00 pm</b> - the whales were highly and consistently active exhibiting numerous breaches, cartwheels and lobtailing with the occasional spyhop thrown in for good measure.

I was with the tour trip out of Port Townsend and we encountered <b>Orcas </b>on the bottom south-west side of <b>San Juan island</b>. We had a great time and I am confused though, they said they were "L" pod, but in your reports, you said "K" pod - so here are some pics, hope you can use some of them. (one photo submitted from S. SJI that morning had J1, and one of your photos does look like L88 - but since several K pod whales have been traveling with J pod, it's possible that members of all 3 pods were present - ON). Oh and I am sending a collage of the Orca with the <b>Minke </b>as well.

<br/>*<br/>
I was out with the [<b>orcas</b>] on Thursday and Friday; don't have much to add to the July 8 reports you've already posted except to say that just after we stopped to watch the southern residents in Haro Strait, a <b>minke </b>surfaced near us--wonder if it was the same one who has been hanging around the orcas lately? It was heading south, away from the orcas, but cruised along the surface for quite some time before we lost sight of it.
July 9, we found the <b>J's</b> about 3 miles NE of <b>Patos Island.</b> At first they were fairly spread out, traveling toward Saturna Island in small subgroups, but after a while Granny did some lobtailing and they all turned north and gathered in a tide rip. Suddenly it was breachfest! I lost count of how many breaches we saw; at one point I saw three orcas in the air at once! Lots of lobtailing and cartwheeling too. We also saw about a dozen or so <b>porpoises </b>just NW of Patos as we came out of Boundary Pass. During our return trip to Seattle we passed Minor Island and saw lots of new harbor seal pups as well!

I went out on Maya's Westside Charters at <b>10:00a.m.</b> We went north to meet with <b>J pod</b> and the <b>4 K pod</b> whales as they came south. We found the Granny J-2/Ruffles J-1 group of about 15 J pod whales (the same split configuration that they have been in for the last month) and surprisingly also Canuck L-7 and Lulu L-53 were traveling with them! As we were traveling back south toward home, other whales had been spotted heading toward East Pt., our direction of travel, so we stopped to see who was there. It was the rest of the J pod whales and the 4 K pod whales (K21, K40, K16 and K35). More of the story on my blog.

We have had many reports of a Gray whale or two still in the area, feeding in the Everett area, so our guess is that either the whale was resting between feeding times, or that it may have become stuck in an area of shallow water and was waiting for the tide to come back in before moving on (it was an incoming tide when we received the call, and no other reports of the whale in that location have come in since) - sb.

Granny, J-2, stills breaches at 99 years old!! She showed us her power and place as the grand matriarch of <b>J-Pod</b> (and the whole Southern Resident Community of Killer Whales) today, as she led the pod south from <b>Turn Point</b>. I wonder that she was communicating to the families to hurry up- catch up! Since the rest of the pod was spread out a mile or more, then they sped swam at about 15 miles an hour, porpoising, leaving wakes, until they reached Henry Island. All the families came closer together and slowed their pace as they went near shore right along the cliffs, probably hunting for salmon. Both of the newest calves kept up with the fast pace. Nothing cuter than watching orca babies leaping up right next to their moms and relatives!

We received a report of whales heading quickly south from <b>East Point</b> and departed Snug Harbor in two vessels, Shachi (with Ken Balcomb, Astrid van Ginneken, Pam Smith, and George Hamilton) and Eagle Dancer (with Mark Malleson, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster). Eagle Dancer encountered <b>J1, J2, J8, J33, J19 and J41</b>, while Shachi documented the <b>J14's and J16's</b> just west of Kellet Bluff at ~<b>3:18 p.m</b> (48° 66.26 ; 123° 22.46 W). We then received another report of more whales coming down Boundary Pass. We first encountered <b>K16, K35, K40 and K21</b> spread out traveling south west off <b>South Pender Island</b>. We later encountered the <b>J17's</b> and the <b>J22's</b>. The encounter ended at Turn Point at 6:42 p.m. (48° 41.12 N; 123° 14.29 W).

Erick Peirson reported the <b>L12s </b>between Sooke and Sherringham, <b>S. Vancouver Island BC</b>, heading west at <b>11:17 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/> 
It was a windy, choppy 4th of July holiday in <b>Southern Georgia Strait</b>. After the great orca passing on Canada Day July 1st the <b>Js and Ks</b> returned June 3, Saturday morning at approximately <b>0730</b>. The report to Lifeforce Whale and Dolphin Hotline said they were moving slow, foraging (circling) and one was belly up slapping the waters. When I arrived at <b>0840 </b>I could still see them heading South. Orcas returned on July 5th in the morning off Lighthouse Marine Park, <b>Point Roberts</b> while others were heading north in <b>Active Pass</b>. The Point ones were spread out taking long dives, doing some foraging, and a bit of socializing. One breached four times in approximately 5 minutes. At about <b>1200 </b>there was another passing not close to shore and heading south.

Southern Residents possibly <b>K and L pod</b> headed east past <b>Tofino </b>at <b>1800 </b>hrs.
<br/>Nick Templeman, Weigh West Resort, Tofino B.C. (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/> 
[<b>Orcas</b>] were picked up at approximately <b>1600 </b>hrs traveling very spread out east bound down the coast at Cleland Island which is about 4 miles southwest of <b>Tofino</b>. We viewed them for 1.5 hrs during which I think we saw some fishing, speed swimming with the swells, and socializing. A couple of breaches out of the male I sent the photo of as well. There were somewhere between 20-25 animals. I didn't see all because they were spread out over a mile or more. We left them passing Lennard Island Lighthouse, 1-2 miles offshore at 1800 hrs.

There were <b>over 100 blue and humpback whales</b> feeding, an exceptional number.

<br/>*<br/>
Here in Everett we spotted what appeared to be two (?) <b>gray whales</b>, possibly one much larger than the other. From the beach at Harborview Park below the train track, we saw the two whales last <b>night</b>. They seemed to be playing, coming as close as 40 feet to the shore, oblivious to the Lab dogs fetching water toys, kids with boogie boards and even the sound of the train.
One appeared to be at least 30 feet long (?), both playing and flipping their tails which were black on the top and appeared white on the back side. The body of one appeared black, white, gray mottled. The tide was coming in around <b>7:30</b> as we observed them for a least 30 minutes, while they slowly swam east to the Everett Naval station from the west and just south of the Mukilteo ferry landing. One man with binoculars said it was the second day he had watched them "scraping barnacles off their bodies." When we finally left, they were still swimming close to the edges of the bulkhead just west of the storage silo before the navy base. I've never seen whales this close in Everett in some 35 years.

Jeff Hogan called Orca Network at <b>4:35 pm</b> to report orca <b>calls </b>on the <b>OrcaSound </b>(NW San Juan Island) hydrophones.
<i>Also tuned into the Center for Whale Research Orca Cam and saw several orcas porpoising out of the water!</i>
<br/>*<br/>
The first [<b>orca</b>] I heard (before I was out of bed this morning) was at <b>0630 </b>and it's now <b>0750 </b>and there are Orca still traveling past Mouat Point. Many small groups moving slowly (mainly) going North in <b>Swanson Channel</b> with several short changes of direction and some feeding behaviour. Several "barrel rolls", and tail slaps. Great way to start the day!

<br/><br/>
Jan, my wife, and I were visiting <b>La Push, WA</b> over the weekend and got a good look at a small group of <b>5-6 killer whales</b> off Third Beach on Sunday. We watched the whales for about 30 min or so sometime between <b>4 and 6 pm.</b> The whales were loitering around much of the time at the edge of Strawberry Bay - we viewed them from Third Beach. They eventually made their way from the eastern part of the bay to the west end and were approaching Teahwhit Head (going northwest) when we last saw them. We were able to see them well enough to note the white eye patch and the silver saddle behind the dorsal fin at times, which confirmed our identification. Two were immatures while the other 3 or 4 were adults. All had curved dorsal fins and there were no adult males in the group. We didn't take any photos, but in hindsight, that might have helped confirm them as transients, I suppose. It was difficult to confirm group size because they never swam and surfaced in any organized manner, but there were definitely at least 5 and perhaps 6. I think that about covers it. I never thought I'd see killer whales along the outer coast so it was very exciting!
<br/>Gary Wiles, WDFW 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30 pm Posession Sound</b> area - Saw a <b>gray whale</b> just off shore between Harborview Park and Howarth Park, headed east toward <b>Everett</b>. Very close to shore, constantly rolling and blowing, worked its way toward Everett/Port Gardner. Showed up later in the day around 6 pm or so, also.
<br/>Mary Dulin 
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report <b>J pod</b> at <b>Lime Kiln</b>, heading north at <b>5:40 pm</b>, amongst the wind and whitecaps. 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Arlene Solomon on <b>Mayne Island</b>, reporting <b>~7 orca</b>s went by at <b>4:05 pm</b> heading north, passing Enterprise Reef and entering Active Pass on the west side.
<br/>*<br/>
We saw what appeared to be part of <b>Jpod </b>between Granny's Cove (<b>American Camp Nat'l Park</b>) and Eagle Point this afternoon around <b>3pm</b>. Lots of quick lunging and tracking along the surface--hopefully finding some good fish. 
<br/>Doug Kari and Tim, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
In the <b>morning </b>we met up with part of <b>J-Pod</b> two miles south of <b>Turn Point</b> slowly heading north at <b>11:30 AM</b>. We saw <b>J1 </b>do half a dozen breaches, <b>J2 </b>give to big cartwheels, and <b>J8 </b>clear the water on a breach as well. The "whale fireworks" outdid the traditional fireworks of the evening on this day, as it is always especially awesome to see some of the older whales going strong.
In the <b>afternoon </b>around <b>3 PM</b> we met up with a different group of <b>J-Pod</b> whales right off <b>Kellett Bluffs</b>. They were milling around, not going anywhere in particular, and spending a lot of time rolling at the surface. In the swell it was tough to confirm IDs, but <b>J34 </b>was definitely there, as were <b>K21 and K40</b> who seem to have become honorary <b>J-Pod</b> whales of late. As always, you can see photos of our encounters on my blog.
<br/>Monika Wieland, Western Prince Naturalist
<br/>*<br/>
We headed to the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> today to oo and awe in the presence of our resident <b>J-pod orcas</b>. We spotted the orcas off every direction of the boat. Not to mention that two bald eagles were flying above us. The orcas were spread out from each other, occasionally joining with a family member to travel in a small closely knit group. We spotted at least one calf, with orange markings that will eventually turn white as the orca matures. The J-pod has had four new calves since 2009. Before we turned back to Friday Harbor the orcas gave us a grand finale. They breached and cartwheeled, creating big splashes and allowing us to view the white undersides of their bellies.
<br/>Sally, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
We headed north towards Battleship Island, and before we knew it, we were seeing a very familiar, large dorsal fin with a wavy back edge to it. Yep--our good friend <b>J1, Ruffles</b>. He was traveling like a good son near his mom, <b>J2 Granny</b>. The bulk of whales were behind them by several miles, so we decided to hang out with Ruffles and Granny for a bit. 
Ruffles decided he wasn't so old after all and launched out of the water!! And I guess he must have had some good food last night as we heard on the radio that he breached an additional 5 times that morning! We then watched <b>J27 </b>and gang come by, and they were porpoising as they sped to catch up to J1 &amp; J2. We had a report of another group of whales that were just milling around Kellett Bluff, so off we went. Along the way we made a very wide scan for dall's porpoises, but they have been very scarce this summer. As we floated about 400 yards from the small group of whales, we noticed that they were taking turns meandering into <b>Open Bay</b>, then out along the shore into the current, and back again. Whales were logging on the surface, some for 2-3 minutes at a time. One whale in Open Bay did a large cartwheel. Another spyhopped along the shoreline at Kellett. And then a big male came up and finally an ID--<b>K21 Cappucino</b>! So knowing he's tight with sister K40 Raggedy, we began looking for her tell-tale dorsal fin. But no sign of her, just a whale with about a foot of her nose sticking out of the water. Kinda like she was thinking of doing a spyhop, but just holding the nose out of the water. For nearly 2 minutes! And then she rose to take a breath and voila--K40! The whales had been milling at Kellett for nearly an hour before we got there, and after about 30 minutes, decided it was time to head south. K40 did 3 breaches, there were lots of surface percussives and more spyhops, and the whales decided "rest and recreation" time was over and it was time to move on.

Here is a photo of <b>L25 </b>Ocean Sun (see below under "Save the Date"), taken in the evening.. It was taken somewhere on the south/west side of <b>San Juan island</b>.

We were close to the minke that some of the orcas were interacting with, mentioned in a previous report. It popped up right by the boat!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:15 pm:</b> lots of [<b>orcas</b>] to begin the holiday weekend today- pretty sure there were members of <b>all three pods</b>- lots of breaching and a nice close pass to shore by an entire family group right out front (Hannah Heights, <b>W San Juan Island</b>).

1) We were shut down off <b>Andrews Bay</b> watching the whales foraging and after being under about 3-4 minutes, <b>Granny </b>surfaced immediately along our port mid-ships and then dove under the boat and resurfaced grasping a salmon, flashing silver in the midday sun. Everyone on board cheered her success!
2)On our evening whale watch off Eagle Pt., we watched for about 15 minutes; <b>J27, L41,L25, L12</b> and a few other orca AND a young <b>Minke </b>swimming together. Certainly two rare sighting treats for the day!

We traveled north to meet the whales traveling down the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. The nice weather and holiday brought out many boaters who were also excited to observe the <b>Orcas</b>. After reaching the whales we recognized <b>Cappuccino </b>and <b>Raggedy </b>from the <b>K pod</b>. The whales were very widely spread along the west side of the island and traveling south. Even though the whales were far apart they could still remain in communication with each other. We often deploy our hydrophone to listen in to these private underwater conversations. Each of the different pods sound distinct and researchers are capable of identifying the pods just by listening to them.

We met up with members of the <b>Southern Resident Orca Community</b> off the south end of <b>Lopez Island</b> today. I was immediately able to identify Raggedy (or <b>K40</b>). She is easily identifiable because of her "raggedy" dorsal fin. The orcas appeared to be fishing. They were very spread out, traveling in no particular direction, and taking longer dives than usual. We traveled with the animals as they headed toward Cape San Juan. Some of the orcas were traveling in a tight-knit group off the coast of South Beach (on <b>San Juan Island</b>) and spent some time porpoising collectively.

John Rochsted of WA State Ferries called to report <b>4 orcas</b> near <b>Anacortes</b>, heading south in Rosario Strait at 3 to 4 knots, at <b>8:58 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
We came upon <b>J-pod</b> as they were southbound, just outside of <b>Deception Pass</b> around <b>10:30 am</b>. Looked like they were feeding, spread out, moving pretty fast and changing directions frequently. We saw them again south of Lopez Island a little after <b>noon</b>, still spread out and with lots of breaching, cartwheeling and lobtailing. We saw <b>Ruffles, Mike, Samish with Se-Yi'-Chn</b> (who was imitating mama's lobtail), <b>Oreo, Doublestuff and Cookie</b>; there were others, too, who I couldn't identify. As we were heading back into Friday Harbor, it looked like maybe another pod was approaching from the SW? Everyone was so spread out it was hard to tell.
Calm waters provided excellent spotting conditions and we saw many porpoises scattered around between Admiralty Inlet and Possession Point; mostly harbor porps but there were a few Dall's too.

I've been on your email list for a while now and have paid particular attention to Monterey Bay sightings as I live in Monterey and have never seen an orca (pretty much the last thing on my list of local wildlife that I'd never seen, but wanted to).
Well, today I was heading home from work on the "scenic" route to avoid the San Francisco Bay Area holiday weekend get out of town traffic, so headed from San Jose to the coast and headed down from San Gregorio all the way to Monterey on Highway 1. I stopped at <b>Moss Landing</b> to see if the raft of otters was being photogenic - and they were! By chance I decided to go to the main mouth of the harbor entrance to see if anything cool was happening there. As I got there and looked out to sea, I saw spouts silhouetted against the sun - kind of large spouts for what I've seen before, so I started snapping away.
When I got home and looked at the photos, I realized that I had seen <b>orcas</b>. The photos are pretty bad, as the orcas were a bit offshore and were directly into the sun from where I was standing at the mouth of the harbor, but I've attached a bunch of them (note these are full size crops from much larger photos and I was shooting with a 400mm lens).
Time was between <b>6:50pm and 7pm</b> - there were <b>four or five</b> of them I think, and they kept coming up in the same area the whole time - slightly north of the harbor entrance - and however far out they were (I can't really tell).
I noticed in the harbor entrance that sea lions were heading out to ocean, so maybe the orcas were just waiting for them? I'm just happy to have finally seen orcas! Regards,
<br/>Tim Huntington, Monterey, CA
<br/><i>From Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whale Watch: Thanks for sending the photos, I have been studying the killer whales in Monterey Bay for 23 years now and know the individuals. I think this group is the <b>CA51's</b>, which is mom with her 3 young plus grandkid. When they are around, they tend to hang out around ML more than others do. If you live in Monterey, best time to see them is April and May. </i>

We were with the <b>southern residents </b>in <b>Swanson Channel</b>; they were swimming close together and there were lots of fins in the air at once--at one point I counted 15 on the surface simultaneously. We also saw the UW Center for Conservation Biology's boat with the orca scat sniffing dog successfully collecting a sample.

After watching <b>J's and L's</b> go by the Center for Whale Research (NW <b>San Juan Isl.</b>) around <b>7:30 a.m</b>, Ken Balcomb, Erin heydenreich, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken departed Snug Harbor and caught up with the whales just off Kellett Bluff at <b>8:46 a.m.</b> (48° 60.197 N; 123° 20.528 W). The whales were spread out in mixed tight groups. We encountered most of <b>L pod</b> in two tight groups traveling slowly north. We had all the <b>L's</b> except the L2's, L54's and some of the L5's. The rest of the <b>J's</b> and possibly the other L's were presumably further north.
The encounter ended at 10:20 a.m. off Stuart Island (48° 68.471 N; 123° 23.742 W).

I recorded a two-hour stay of some <b>Js</b> in the <b>Pt. Roberts</b>, WA south side bay. Previously times were approximately 1 hour and then later returns. We should call this critical habitat South Residents Orca Bay. 
The July 1 Canada Day holiday began for Lifeforce as <b>orcas </b>were reported as heading north to <b>Active Pass</b>. Well it was a split so some of the orcas were off Lighthouse Marine Park at <b>3PM </b>heading south. They were very spread out and actively engaged in foraging and socializing. J28 and her baby were there with baby on her back and baby raising the head way out of the water. They moved back and forth generally heading south easterly but at 5PM they made one final turn and kept going heading back to the Fraser River. As whale watch company jargon goes, the others who were ahead as "leaders" followed and they became the "trailers". 
Now it was time to see if the trip north will be long or short by returning to the park in the dark to listen for their passing. It was a beautiful quiet night and at 2308 multiple blows were heard for about 30 minutes. The whoofs, whoofs, whoofs were a night time whale hear experience. Amongst the many, many blows one could hear some slaps and splashes.

We got spoiled with <b>J pod</b> and some <b>K's</b> giving us an awesome show! Playing in the kelp beds, spyhopping, breaching - you name it, we saw it. We followed them from <b>Swanson Channel</b> and into <b>Active Pass</b>. It was a Canada Day that my passengers and I will never forget! Here are a couple pictures, one of a bellyflop from J16 entering the pass and another of a J Pod breach (see photo above) in the Active Pass.

<br/>*<br/>
We left the dock and we made our way over to the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> where the <b>Orcas </b>were reported to be. We traveled south along the island watching the whales calmly moved along. They were in no rush as they occasionally changed direction and milled about. Their slow pace offered some wonderful views of these amazing animals. 
<br/>Casey, San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
This morning the show began just about <b>6:30am</b>- there were whales headed north very close to the shores of the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. I only saw a few at first but within 30 minutes I began to hear pec slaps and blows echoing up the hill. I ran outside to find LOTS of <b>J's and L's</b> spyhopping and rolling around in the kelp along the shoreline. Hoping they would stay close to shore I ran over to Lime Kiln and sure enough---group after group began languidly swimming by the rocky outcroppings, coming incredibly close to the shore. Lots of breaches, rolls, and tight family groupings. 
It was great to see so many L pod members I have not seen "up close" for a while- and the angle at which they passed the shore allowed many chances to see their faces as they rolled through the water.
