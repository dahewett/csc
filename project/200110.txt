<br/><b>Comments:</b>And a report of porpoise off Ledgewood Beach, west Whidbey Island: I have been watching some fins off Ledgewood Beach for the past hour.Using 40-50 x scope.I am pretty sure there are 3-4 harbor porpoises,although they could be Dahl's.They appear black,but I think that is a function of light conditions and distance.The rolling behavior looks more like Harbor,and I saw no rooster-tails. I was sick when I read your note of Orcas at Mulilteo yesterday-I was on the 1:00 ferry,and we didn't see them. Sue Skubinna

<br/><b>Direction:</b> north
<br/><b>Comments:</b>Susan, Was looking out the window this afternoon and saw about 14 killer whales eating and breaching out in front of my home - I live in Marysville, Wa. and have never seen killer whales in Port Susan bay in the past 17 years I have lived here, only grays. My son spotted the whales around 4:30p.m. They were heading up towards Kayak Point and Warm Beach the last we saw. We live at Mission Beach on the Tulalip Reservation for a better point of reference on the whales. They originated from the east, coming up along the shore line in front of our house. We were extremly excited to see them, especially when they would breach!!! There were always two whales further out front of the group. Then the others came along. One looked like it was a young one, smaller then the others. I would love to help out. Next time we see them I will contact you . Thanks Kim Larson

<br/><b>Comments:</b>What perfect timing! We got to the overlook above Lake Hancock (central/west Whidbey Isl.) at 11:45, just in time to watch the long procession of orcas going past mid-channel, still heading north. We watched until after 12:30, at which time they were past Pt. Wilson &amp; the fog &amp; rain was closing in making visibility impossible. There were at least 3 mature males, lots of breaching &amp; splashing &amp; fishing behaviors, especially between downtown Pt. Townsend &amp; Greenbank. Too many whales &amp; too far off to get an accurate count, but we can safely say there were LOTS of them! Susan

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hi Susan, WOW!!! Crashing waves in the afternoon glow of the setting sun; along with whale's blows lighting up like misty explosions of golden light. That's what it was like as a group of 10-15 whales passed the Land Bank, the County Park, and then the Center for Whale Research this afternoon. The whale's were backlit, though, so it was very difficult to identify them in the chop, and they stayed down for long dives between sequences of 4-5 breaths... Ken Balcomb first sighted them along the west side near Hannah Heights, and followed them up the coastline, where we got a closer look at them as they passed Sunset Point just a few moments ago (1845 end of encounter). Sorry not to identify them, but here's the report, nonetheless. Kelley Balcomb Bartok, Orca Conservancy

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hi Susan, We had whales southbound along the Sunset Point (west side of San Juan Island) a little after 3 pm, but there were only L-pod memebers confirmed by Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research. He continued his observations at the Land Bank, and again at Hannah Height and Eagle Point, and it was the same group of whales the entire length of the Island. Don't know where the K-pod or J-pod were, only L-whales, including L-57 and L-41 were observed, according to Ken. It's interesting to note, that after conversations with Mark Sears just a few minutes ago, it seems the whales left Bremerton Harbor after dark and traveled all the way up Puget Sound and around the islands, passing the west side of San Juan Is. this afternoon. That is a FAST trip up the Sound!!!! Anyhow, that's what we know from here. I'd love to know where J's and K's were, if Ron or somebody can give more details, that would be awesome!!! Kelley

<br/><b>Comments:</b>Hi Susan! Our fledgling little North Beach [Ballard] sighting community is submitting its first orca report! Albeit two days late... An estimated 12-15 orcas, three separate groups, were sighted traveling north at a high speed ["porpoising"] about 400 yards off North Beach [waterfront Ballard] at approximately 11am on Tuesday. The sighter reported approximately "five distinctly tall dorsal fins" among the animals, and about five recreational boaters chasing them aggressively. Such is often the case down here when whales show up. More bad news... the whales happen to have passed directly through a raw sewage break that happened that morning near Carkeek Park. It's a good thing they were moving fast. Our neighborhood is shoring up its sighting network as the winter orca season approaches, so we'll be a lot faster in getting these reports out!
