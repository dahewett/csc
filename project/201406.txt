<br/>

The <b>whales</b> were busy on the <b>west side of San Juan</b> today. - Spencer Domico

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was that kind of a day...Parts of <b>J and L Pods, Salmon Bank and the West Side, San Juan Island</b>, WA. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 - Southern Resident's vocalizing on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. Loud calls again now at 8:42 (with ship noise). A tanker coming from the south, enjoyed the quiet ever so briefly. Must be spread out....was quiet all morn then sudden burst of loud calls and echo, been faint to moderate since initial calls. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A group of very lively <b>Orcas passed Point Roberts between 5 and 5:25 pm</b>. One large male with four females. Breaching, spy hopping, and lots of tail lobbing. Heading north and travelling close together. - Sandra Scott

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 PM - Pod of 5-8 killers sighted off Depoe Bay Oregon</b> area heading South to North. Seemed to be accompanied by a few common dolphins. Saw dorsal fins, some breaching, dolphins leaping. - Barbara Bechmann

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:05 - Whales on Lime Kiln</b>. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 PM - Large pod possibly L pod in Boundary pass</b> just off Pender Island, traveling. We encountered a large pod, could not count how many so thinking that it might be the largest, L pod? - Natalie Fallis

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

As we picked up <b>J and L pods on the Canadian side of Haro Strait</b>  they were spread out and most were in resting pattern. Taking a little break as they crossed Haro Strait towards the southern side of San Juan Island. As they approached the island they became more active and appeared to begin hunting salmon. Watching them at rest in tight groups, surfacing and breathing in unison is always wonderful. It was amazing to watch. They <b>gathered in the False Bay </b>area with a couple groups of L's further south. One of the females out in front if False Bay started slapping her tail and the whales to the south made a beeline to join up with the others. L92 was with the southernmost whales. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were out with the<b> Transient Gangs 101's and 102, as well as the 002C's</b>. We came on scene as the T's were coming together out of Hoskyns Channel (<b>far north end of Georgia Strait</b>), west side of Reid Island. We stayed with them as they rounded Viner Point and headed North up the Reid Isl shoreline. Mostly just swimming, resting, some lazy tail lobs and such. we left them @ 1700hrs Northbound up Reid Isl. Of note to us were some new rake marks for 102 here, and the fact that 002C2 Tumbo was lagging behind the family a bit again. Today he was with 101B alot of the time......looked almost like escorting or staying with him anyways. It was interesting to watch anyways. - Nick Templeman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T137's in Boundary Pass.</b> They were SUPER mellow just cruising east through the pass in a very close intimate family group. I love seeing them so relaxed....don't get me wrong, breaches are great but it's just so different and calming to see them like this. - Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Maybe transients -- <b>7:00 PM - 6-8 whales moving westward just east of Thieves Bay Marina, North Pender Island</b>. We are waiting in anticipation for additional whales. May be a transient pod. - Ken Plato

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Last night around <b>5pm I saw 2 whales</b> passing my beach so I kayaked out and followed them from Davis Head to the Richardson dock (going counterclockwise around Lopez) off the <b>south end of Lopez Island</b>.  I'm fairly certain they were gray whales and had barnacles or other white growth on them. - Thomas (Dylan) Cline

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Whale sighting <b>in Discovery Bay by Adelma Beach. Possible Gray Whale</b>. Very close to the beach at low tide around <b>11 AM </b>or so. - Aki Valdehuesa Avelino

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

Yesterday we were out with the Residents, some of <b>Jpod and some of Lpod</b>, towards the <b>southern end of San Juan Island</b>. Boy did we see some interesting things. We saw <b>J35 and J47 'playing' with a harbour porpoise! </b>We also saw foraging and breaching. We had L118 surprise us with three breaches in a row and L95 seeming to come out of nowhere, coming to check us out. Great day out on the water! - Ashley Keegan, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Incredible day  Very curious group of whales. Today was amazing too with more action from<b> J's and L's off the west side near False Bay</b>. Tons of foraging and goofing around. I've attached two pictures of L118 "Jade" breaching. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:08 - Whales on Lime Kiln hydro</b>. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J Pod is headed back in from Trial Island</b>. Enroute now. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transients off Sooke.</b> - Sooke Coastal Expeditions

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Transient Orcas (<b>TO75 &amp; TO75A near Becher Bay</b>). - Andrew Lees

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:45 PM - West side of Whidbey, between Lagoon and Bush Pts. One male and three females</b>, heading generally south, but circling back for about 10-15 minutes, possibly feeding, birds circling overhead. One spy-hopped. - Deborah Heg

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpbacks off Sooke </b>(15 miles west of Victoria). - Sooke Coastal Expeditions

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Thought you might like to see these pictures of a <b>2 Humpback Whales</b>, Big Mama &amp; her Calf, we encountered off Victoria (<b>south of Race Rocks</b>) yesterday morning! There was actually<b> 9 Humpback Whales reported in the area</b> (including "Split Fin" right off Albert Head) as well as <b>Transient Orcas (TO75 &amp; TO75A near Becher Bay)</b> plus <b>Resident Orcas were first picked up south of Trial Island heading east</b>. We do not usually get this amount of Humpback Whales in our local waters until much later in the season, so this is very exciting. - Andrew Lees, Five Star Whale Watching

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 27</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Ts again!!!! 124As</b> (no 124A1). Lots of surface time for most of the encounter and great overcast lighting. Another great encounter with <b>Bigg's killer whales</b>. - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This evening from <b>6:15 to 6:45</b> I watched spread out <b>Js and Ls make their way south in Haro Strait </b>from Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:44 - </b>Just heard them<b> again on Lime Kiln</b>. - Sandy Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:31 - Whales on Lime Kiln hydro</b>. - James Gresham

<b>J's and L's came down from East Point</b> and headed <b>down San Juan Island</b>. - Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5 killer whale</b>s were reported by an anonymous caller who said the whales were at 46.48 x 124.08, which is just south of <b>Gray's Harbor WA</b>, maybe 2-300 yards off the beach, at about <b>2 pm</b>.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 25</font></b></center>
<br/>

Wednesday's Wondrous Whales!!!! Sunny, glassy smooth water, <b>J and L pod</b>, caught up with them, sort of spread out, off<b> Eagle Point</b> (San Juan Island) ....heading north, gave the folks at<b> Lime Kiln </b>a thrill....then further up...formed up into groups, breaching, multiple big tail slaps, and a lot of rolling over and showing that beautiful white underside...two young ones, maybe Joy and Cousteau of L pod? Pictures to follow. Very happy group of passengers aboard Mystic Sea. Whoopee!!! - Bonnie Gretz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

4:13 pm - Orcas on the Lime Kiln Hydros. Boats, too.
Kara E. Clayton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:54 - Calls on Lime Kiln</b> right now! Distant though. - Amber Prewitt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:30 - Lime Kiln still very active chatter</b>. FABULOUS! - Kim Merriman

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 24</font></b></center>
<br/>

The <b>Js and Ls</b> did the unexpected today! They came down <b>President's Channel</b> instead of <b>Rosario or Boundary</b>, and looked like they were going to continue down <b>San Juan Channel</b>. Then they did a U-Turn, and came close to shore at <b>Reuben Tarte County Park</b> (NE San Juan Island, near Roche Harbor) at 1 PM, then went west through Spieden Channel. When they reached Haro Strait they fanned out and slowly made their way south against the strong flood tide, with some whales close to shore and others out in the middle of the strait. It took them from about 2:30 to 5:00 PM to fully pass by Lime Kiln Lighthouse! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I. AM. EXHAUSTED. After striking out with orcas early this morning, ended up with an EPIC (there's that darn word again) encounter from shore at<b> Rueben Tarte. J's and L's</b> came right by the rocks and were literally at our feet. Most of these photos are not cropped - that's how close they were! What a fun place to see them. A first for me! And then caught them again on the west side as they headed south against a big flood. - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today the<b> J Pod and (part of) L Pod </b>took an interesting route through the<b> San Juan Islands</b>. They came down into <b>President Channel</b>, milled around across the top of San Juan Channel, some made it to Yellow Island, then everyone turned back north socializing and breaching all the way back north. They actually tucked in behind O'Neil Island and some orcas went on both sides. I've never seen Resident orcas in this area. What a fun experience. Very happy whales with lots of adult play time in between! - Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It's been so great to have the <b>J's and L's</b> around for multiple days now! So many incredible encounters with them. Yesterday was no exception....J's and L's moving <b>north up Swanson channel</b> along the Pender bluffs. Two big resting groups, <b>J's in the lead and L's trailing</b>. Here is a pic of some of the L's in their resting pattern. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:59pm - </b>They are just <b>talking away on Lime Kiln!</b> So cool! - Jean Karlsson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:40pm - Calls still on Lime Kiln!</b> - Vickie Doyle

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

On our way off island,we meandered to County park at <b>11:40</b> and caught glimpses of the <b>SRKW tail-enders and left at 12:18</b> with leaders at<b> Open Bay</b> (north end of San Juan Island). - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Daylight is dimming and we still don't have a positive visual contact of the humpbacks from south of Bush Point. Hard to imagine they got by us, but about 9:05 we thought we heard two blows already north of us behind the bluff and out of sight, still heading north from the sounds. - Howard Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:06pm - Two humpbacks just passed point no point</b>. They gave a great show with tail slaps and jumping out of the water. They're headed north. - Mary Bright

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:15 PM - Humpback Whale Admiralty Inlet</b>. Watched what appeared to be a <b>humpback whale breaching off Point No Point in the middle of Admiralty</b>. Breathtaking sight. It was headed northwest up Admiralty. We were at our beach house at Point No Point watching. Tail flukes smashing the water, breaching, just spouting as he/she traveled up the channel. It started closer to the Kitsap side but seemed to move closer to Whidbey as it swam away from us. - Sean Hatt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

About<b> 3:30 pm</b> was driving my 24 foot sailboat south from Oak Harbor to Seattle - <b>just off the Edmonds Marina I saw a whale</b> just about 50 yards off my starboard side - <b>about 40 feet long</b> (?). Did several shallow dives (3-4 times) - blew (breathed) several times - saw its tail but do not remember seeing the dorsal fin. Just one whale. Wasn't certain it was an Orca - seemed grey more than black &amp; white. Had a bump on its head. - Kenneth Johnson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I didn't see it for myself, but I was talking with a locksmith at our house in Richmond Beach around <b>11:00am</b>. He was looking out the window towards the water as we were chatting and claims he saw a<b> "big" whale surface</b>. I scanned for 5+ minutes afterwards but never saw anything. Wonder if this was the same animal spotted up north earlier today? - Dave Haas

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0845 - one humpback</b> at 48deg 09'N x 122deg 41'W, <b>about 200 yards off Fort Casey, Admiralty Head</b>, Whidbey Island, traveling south. Observed it sounding three times, then deep dive (flukes clearly in air). - Andy Reay-ellers, r/v JACK ROBERTSON, UofW,  Applied Physics Lab

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 22</font></b></center>
<br/>

I was on the delayed <b>7:25pm </b>WSF Kaleetan <b>to Orcas Island</b>. The whales were headed SSE at a pretty good clip.  They were forward and a bit to Port of the vessel when first sighted. - Cindy Wolf

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Up and down San Juan Island, all day long in tight, affectionate groups, and their emphatic puffs of watery exhales accompanied me as I worked. All day long, back and forth. - Alex Shapiro

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The second day of summer brought calm seas and sunshine along with members of<b> J pod into Bellingham Channel at 11:30 am</b>. The whales looked relaxed, a hint of flirtation here, a little play there, a couple of spy-hops to check out the scene and some tail slaps for good measure. Later they turned and greeted us again with Blackberry (J27) trailing kelp, after we circled Cypress Island. A memorable and peaceful encounter for all to appreciate and enjoy. - Sandra Pollard (SSAMN) - Mystic Sea.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This morning the part of <b>L-Pod that's here (the L26s, L43s, L4s, L47s)</b> went north on the west side of San Juan Island, then they came back by <b>Lime Kiln and Land Bank</b> heading south at <b>about 2 PM</b>. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:26pm - </b>On the west side of Sinclair <b>(2-3 miles north of Anacortes ferry landing). Five Orcas! </b>Same group.
<br/><b>12:24pm - </b><b>Orcas south of Cypress Island!</b> - Kathy Halstead

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:14 - J pod, Bellingham channel </b>(Just North of Anacortes, between Guemes Island and Cypress Island). - Chris Santana

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T049A1 off Victoria</b>. - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had<b> two humpbacks very close to shore, around 7:00 PM going south to American Camp</b>.  not sure of exact time. My rock is between eagle point and false bay on san juan island. - Jenny

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I am on<b> False Bay Rd</b>... I can't see the water, but can hear them when it is quiet. At<b> 5:30 pm</b> tonight... in <b>between Eagle Pt. and Mar Vista </b>I'd guess... the loudest blow ever!! - Cher Renke

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 pm -</b> I suddenly jumped at the other-worldly sound of the deepest, loudest exhale I'd ever heard. Looking up, there it was: my first <b>Humpback whale visitor</b>, in all the years I've lived on this point. The whale submerged and swam further away from shore, and I did not see it again. I gasped as I saw the huge body lumber past me, powerful, graceful, and just 50 yards from my feet. A memorable moment, and of course, photos don't do it justice! - Alex Shapiro

Lucky us. Whales two days in a row! Who wants to cook supper when you can watch whales from the shore of<b> Galiano Island </b>instead? Not us on Saturday around <b>6:30 pm</b>, when a larger and then smaller group of orcas went eastward <b>through Active Pass</b>. - Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

WOW! Kind of day today. We knew <b>Residents were on west side San Juan Island and there were reports of Transients up north</b>. We went up San Juan Channel to intercept the Ressies as they came up Haro Strait headed north. All of a sudden comes a report of a bunch of Transients at Seal Rock, right at the west end of San Juan Channel, where it meets Haro Strait. We stopped on them. It was the <b>TO49A's and TO36A's swimming together. 7 animals.</b> We watched them take a seal and then here comes <b>J Pod</b>! Spread out across the strait. They were only about a half mile apart and that is rare. We hopped over to J Pod with Granny leading up Haro. Then here comes the<b> J 17's</b> in close to us. We hooked up with them and they started putting on an air show. Breaches and cartwheels. While we were with the J's the T's came into Haro Strait and started moving north right along the shore of Stuart Island. Awesome day. Great conditions. Looks like the J's (at least some of them) went up to the Fraser River and the L's stayed down to the south. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A bright, peaceful Saturday as <b>J-pod and part of L-pod intermingled and swam in resting lines towards San Juan Island</b>. It was so lovely to witness so many whales swimming so close together and in no hurry at all. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This morning around <b>11:30 J-Pod and part of L-Pod made their way north through Haro Strait in two big, tight groups</b> - I saw them from Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island. <b>Between 2 and 3 PM some (if not all) of the L-Pod whales made their way back south past Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b>. This time they were very spread out and doing some foraging as they slowly passed by. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Back to those wonderful <b>T's</b> today. We were initially heading to the west side to see the residents but got a report of whales up near <b>Thrasher rock off of Gabriola Island</b>. We headed up that way and picked up the <b>T124A's</b> hammering a seal in the distance. When we got closer they were just eating and celebrating. It's the best when you just shut off your engines and watch....they didn't move anywhere for almost 45 minutes we just drifted with them watching them celebrate and chow down. The breacher is T124A2A I believe, missing part of the fluke. - Gary Sutton

It has just been so spectacular the last few days!! Another treat today as we got to see <b>most of L's with some J's scattered in going through Active Pass</b> and heading into the Strait of Georgia. I would list off all their behaviours but to keep it short and sweet....they did EVERYTHING!!! Such a cool day! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

A double treat for us on the shore of <b>Galiano Island</b> today. Around<b> 12 noon</b>, one group of about <b>6 - 8 orcas went eastward through Active Pass</b>. Then around <b>2 pm, a second group of 10 - 12 went through</b>. The second group displayed many breaches, spyhops, tail slaps, and cartwheels. - Karoline Cullen

I saw a <b>Minke Whale spyhop!</b> Quick note: Minke whales are the second smallest baleen whale and spend about 90% of their time underwater. We were sitting in the water glassing for killer whales, everything was quiet, when suddenly "Koosh"- there's a Minke Whale 100 yards off our port starring at us, baleen exposed and all! Welp, there's a first for everything. I must admit, for a short second, I was wondering what the heck I was looking at!! So cool ... - Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Well not many words or pictures could accurately depict what went on today. <b>L's were racing in from out west and J's were pushing offshore</b> very quickly to meet them. Once they joined up, there was <b>mish mash of J's and L's interacting like crazy</b>. Breaching, spy hops and much more but the highlight is always when they start logging on the surface, vocalizing above the surface, pushing each other around, touching and rubbing. Incredible day <b>3 miles offshore of Eagle pt</b>. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<b>No Ks and NOT all of Ls</b> (from what I heard) - but a very good chunk of them. Today was epic! Lots of rolly polly behavior and BIG groups of very happy whales doing pretty much nothing.

Alisa and Ed Brooks updated their report: <b>12:45 pm, watching the meet up of J and L pods</b>, about <b>1 mile out from South Beach, SW San Juan Island</b>. They <b>first met up at 12:15</b>, with tons of breaches. Sounds like a great whale day off San Juan Island!

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Obviously we have no way of knowing when they last saw one another but heartwarming to know they do greet one another and have "things to say" and activities to share when they come together. Honestly, the breaching and tail lobbing was endless. My only (selfish) wish is that they were closer in or at Lime Kiln.
<br/><b>7:47 -</b> got to County Park a little after 7, looked like they were already well north could see far off distant blows, shimmering bodies and one spyhop. Northbound they go...unless.

<b>J Pod spent the last 3 plus daylight hours off the west side of San Juan Island</b>, engaged in a lovely variety of behaviors going against the tide and in the massive churning rip-current just south of the West Side Preserve/Land Bank off what I think is Edwards Point.

<b>One orca in Discovery Bay </b>(5 miles west of Port Townsend). It seemed to be resting on the waters surface for over a minute. I could also see an aircraft carrier traveling south east through the strait (towards Everett? ) We were wondering if it came into our bay to get away from the carriers noise? It was between my house and Protection Island. After a minute or so, it swam down the bay a bit, dove a little, and exited the bay so close to the cape George shore that I could hear occasional blowing, but not see it. It was a terrific experience, but concerned for its safety/health. - Sharon Mitchel

<b>L pod sighted off Tofino!</b> As I am typing (<b>10:18 pm</b>) a group of <b>10-12 killer whales with open saddles</b> are heading up the coast. The last report was 2.5 miles off sea lion rocks (long beach area). Rod wanted me to send a note. I am sure we will have a more detailed route and photos by the end of the day. Here are a couple of ID shots. The pod was spread out in a long line ranging from off Cleland island to off Tree island when I was out, and the skippers have reported that they are still spread out quite a ways and not moving very much at all. I am guessing there is between 15 and 20 in total. They look like southern residents because of that open saddle on the bull. - Gwen, Strawberry Isle Research on N. Vancouver Island

A really wonderful encounter with the <b>T124As</b>. Very social, and just about the most adorable calves I have ever watched.<b> T124A5 and T124A2A</b>, both almost the same age, were SUPER playful with each other. It looks like they were having a tail slapping competition at one point, as they furiously slapped their floppy flukes on the water in tandem. They were like little pieces of popcorn bouncing around and breaching out of the water, doing child-like back breaches that would turn into wiggly fluke kicks in the air, cartwheels over top of each other, side twists ... just being hyper kids! Their playful energy seemed to rub off on older sibling T124A4 who joined them in the breach fest. It has been a privilege to encounter so many Bigg's killer whales this season so far. I can't imagine the number of times we must bomb past these guys on our way to see the resident whales. The photos do not do it justice, but it does give you an idea of how much they were breaching! - Tasli Shaw

Killer whales in <b>Plumper Sound</b>! My first time seeing them in there. And who else but the <b>T65As</b>, our "resident transients". We watched what appeared to be a classroom situation, with a very unlucky harbour seal being the lesson. Mom and baby sat off to the side while the other three kids took multiple passes at the seal. Many powerful lunges and even a sideways karate chop. The finishing blow sent the harbour seal flying in the air. Lesson over, time for recess. - Tasli Shaw

Well our "resident Biggs", <b>T65A's</b>, were kicking ass again today!! Only the second time I've seen whales in <b>Plumper Sound</b> and they were just hammering a seal! Amazing to see the power these animals can display and really cool to see T65A cruising in circles with T65A5 around the other whales hunting the seal. A live demonstration of how it is done! Got spoiled with getting to see the <b>T137's</b> on the way home too in Boundary Pass. They were the polar opposite of the T65A's.....being super mellow in a beautiful resting line. They were only swimming hard enough to not be pushed up by the flood and were not moving anywhere. Gorgeous day out there. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Hi - we were headed to<b> Desolation Sound</b>, from Gorge Harbor (north end of Georgia Strait), and encountered <b>a small pod of Orcas on the west side of Hernando Island</b>, about <b>9:30 am</b>.

<b>10:21 pm -</b> They were really faint on <b>Lime Kiln</b>, but waiting paid off as they were practically on top of the hydrophone within five minutes! Can't believe how exciting this gets! - Danielle Vance

<b>10:16 - </b>I love this! I've heard some squeaks and squeals, but also some <b>vocalizations</b> I've never heard before and it's AWESOME! - Kristina Louise Dahl

<b>J pod</b> can be heard <b>vocalizing on OrcaSound hydrophone</b>. Earlier Connie Bickerton started hearing faint calls at <b>7:17pm on Lime Kiln</b> which turned into a burst of loud activity an hour later at <b>8:20pm</b>. They were traveling northbound and could be heard on <b>OrcaSound by 8:55 </b>where calls are still audible now at <b>9:37pm</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

As we sat watching the water and enjoying food, up pops <b>a humpback whale</b>! Certainly a bonus to the towering mountains, shimmering waters, and dazzling skies. And then wouldn't ya know about an hour later here come some<b> transient (Bigg's) killer whales! </b>They were frolicking and doing lots of high speed lunges and spyhops as they <b>moved south down the island</b> when suddenly they put the skids on so fast and did a very abrupt about-face, turned tail and started cruising toward Victoria. Hmmm, that was interesting... We look south and then BIG SPLASH! Put up binoculars and... HOLY FLYING ORCAS, BATMAN! Here comes <b>J pod up the west side complete with J2 Granny</b> near the lead. Screw dinner theater - this is the most action-packed cafe I've ever had the pleasure of dining at... - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:17 pm -</b> Several of<b> J pod</b> appear to be feeding after sunset at <b>Mitchell Point</b>, off of the west side of San Juan Island between Lime Kiln Point and Henry Island. They've shuffled back and forth at least twice, and are still going well after dark. It was a beautiful night, though, and it was magical seeing and hearing the whales offshore. - Tom Hoyt

Another incredible day on the water!! Spent most of the day with the <b>T86A's, T137's and T124A1</b>. T86A's mouth seemed to be open the whole day and looked to have some damage. After leaving the scene, we got a report that they joined up with another <b>18 whales!!!</b> We made a quick "U" turn and saw that the <b>T124's, T124A's, T77's and T65A's</b> came steam rolling south, appeared out of no where and joined the party!! 26 Bigg's killer whales! They were in a HUGE hurry bombing through <b>Active Pass</b> and going south. Amazing to such a large group of them! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At least <b>26 Bigg's killer whales</b> today .... a "personal best" for me! We were already privileged to watch the <b>T137s, 86As, and 124A1</b> be very social at the surface when we got on scene ... but then ... on the horizon we could see two lines of white froth and spray. The spray got closer and closer, revealing <b>at least 15 more orcas </b>speeding towards us from the west, all in one long line of porpoising whales (<b>T77s, T124s minus 124C, 124As, 65As, likely others as well</b>). You could practically hear Ride of the Valkyries playing as they steamed toward us. Totally awesome, fabulous creatures. I'm blown away yet again. T86A had her mouth open throughout the entire encounter, leading me to believe something is amiss ...You can see some water squirting out the side.- Tasli Shaw

A glorious day on the water with sunshine, blue skies and seas. Mystic Sea caught up with <b>Big Momma and calf </b>around <b>1:45 pm off Sidney</b>, Vancouver Island, and watched as the pair chopped and changed direction a few times (plenty of good food hopefully) and gave more than one graceful wave of their tail flukes before taking a deep dive. A delight to see these huge baleen whales in our waters performing their own special ballet. - Sandra Pollard

<b>J pod</b> had fun today chasing salmon up and down the west side o<b>f San Juan Island</b>! They started the morning southbound, passing <b>Lime Kiln</b> and continuing to Salmon Bank, where they foraged for a couple of hours. Then they revisited Lime Kiln briefly only to turn south again for Salmon Bank, where they feasted, tailslapped, and breached for quite a while (frustratingly just out of reach of a shore based camera). Back north again in the evening, <b>not quite to the West Side Preserve before they turned south just before sunset</b>. This photo (a cell phone shot of my camera LCD) is from their afternoon Lime Kiln visit. The orcas seem to be eating well! - Meg McDonald

<b>11:15 - 11:48 -</b> I can hear them now! I can hear them now! YAY! I have no idea what that sound was at <b>11:25 a.m</b>.  It sounded like a hideously high pitched fire alarm. I've never heard a boat sound like that before...but then my head isn't usually under water. It hurt MY ears. Can't imagine what it does to the whales. Plus, the squeals have awakened my cats - who are now sitting at my computer listening to the vocalizations, too.  Funny! - Kim Merriman

Ron Bates of Victoria's MMRG says the<b> L12s</b> left today. However, he had a fun report of the <b>Humpback they call Big Mama</b>, with a calf - the 4th or 5th calf she has shown up with over the past years. They were breaching and swimming 1 mile east of Seabird Pt. (the eastern end of Discovery Island, east of Victoria) at about <b>3:30 pm</b> today.

Larry set out to go fishing <b>off Anacortes</b>, but when the orcas arrived, he called me, picked me up at the dock and off we went. We spent about three hours with the <b>orcas</b>, including J34 Doublestuf, saw close to 10 breaches (none captured) and as we sat dead in the water (no motor), one swam right under our boat! - Eileen Eimermann

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:30 - </b>Today I was out at <b>Norwegian Park, in Hansville</b>, with my two little boys exploring and I KNOW I saw <b>a large black animal with a fin</b> swimming in the<b> direction of Point No Point</b>. It was very far out, about the center of the waterway. I watched for a good 15 minutes as it came up to the surface, went back down, came up, just moving about at its own pace with no real hurry or obvious playtime. Nothing at all like the harbor seals we have seen hanging about happily fishing. (too far out for the camera on my phone to get a decent shot). - Jessica Coffman

Today: <b>35 resident killer whales, 4 Bigg's killer whales, and a Big Momma the humpback with her new calf.</b>..all within 5ish miles of each other. Not bad Salish Sea, not bad. Never made it down to the residents, but it turned out to be the <b>T137A</b> show for us! Not once but TWICE he made a beeline for the boat from 100 yards away and appeared to inspect the hull. I'm presuming there must have been a harbour seal hiding under us. Wowza. I am SO FREAKING LUCKY and honoured (??? right word????) to see these things. - Tasli Shaw

Epic <b>Orcas today off Lime Kiln State Park</b> on San Juan Island! Members of <b>J-pod and L-pod came within 100 feet of shore</b> (some were MUCH closer than that even!) and swam back and forth several times. It was one of the most amazing Killer Whale encounters I've ever had. It is such an amazing thing, to see Killer Whales in the wild, and in a huge. - Chris Teren

So if anyone wonders why I get up early, stay up late, freeze, starve, get drenched, run up hills, run down hills, run out of work, keep my bag packed at all times, or in general seem a little crazy....it's for the supreme honor of witnessing moments like this. Today<b> the rest of J-Pod and the L12s (at least) joined in the fun</b>. It was epic stuff <b>on the west side</b> this afternoon. I'm still basking in the afterglow of such an amazing encounter. - Monika Weiland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:25 -</b> I quite simply haven't the words to describe today. Easily one of my best shore encounters ever with<b> J pod and... L pod!</b> That's right! Those little sneakers popped into the islands last night. Our day started bright and early...only it wasn't so bright this morning. Lots of fog, mist, and wind. After sitting on the west side of the island for three hours with nothing materializing, it was time to go to town and grab breakfast. Midway through the meal we get the report: lots and LOTS of orcas at Eagle Point northbound which then ensued the unhealthy shoving down of food and running for the door (we did remember to pay ). Upon reaching the west side at Land Bank we saw <b>J2 Granny, J19 Shachi, J41 Eclipse, and J26 Mike</b> meandering up the coastline. They looked as if they might come close into shore which then caused us to go huffing and puffing quickly up the hill to drive down to Lime Kiln Lighthouse. While scrambling down onto the rocks at the light, Granny came by with the other three, but instead of continuing north, they turned and went back south. OH NO! We made the wrong decision to leave Land Bank which turned quickly into regret and shaming ourselves for not being patient. BUT! That's when things began to change. As we looked to the south, we began to see more and more and <b>MORE orcas rounding Edwards Point</b>. They were in very tight, playful groups and they were so close to shore! Oh...if only they keep coming this way... And did they ever! They came in close at the lighthouse. They were practically at our feet as they socialized and frolicked in the silvery afternoon sun, adrenaline pounding through our systems like a happy wrecking ball, squeals of exuberance. - Katie Jones

Really excited to share this one with you all. What a spectacular sunset pass by<b> J Pod </b>last night. Lots of "dorcas" or "orcaholics" if you will, were in attendance. And no one really left until it was so dark, you could barely see. The clicks you hear in the video were live streamed by<b> Lime Kiln's hydrophone</b> that you can listen to with any wifi ready device. The hammering sounds, are echolocation they use to find fish. There is a special appearance by a River Otter as well that was playing in the kelp beds. - Traci Walter

A great way to start Orca month (June) with <b>Granny - J-2</b> - leading a large J-pod group by<b> Henry Island</b>. <b>Many T's in the area on the west side of Orcas Island</b>....whales all over....calm seas, sunny skies = paradise. - Jill Hein

Around<b> 11:30 AM</b> I watched the<b> J22s and J14s </b>head north close to shore past <b>Lime Kiln Point State Park</b>. I believe the rest of <b>J-Pod</b> that was present was already further north. At<b> 3:30 PM </b>I saw a very distant<b> group of transients from Reuben Tarte State Park</b> - heading from Presidents Channel towards Flat Top Island, then a bit later heading across and around the north end of Spieden Island. From <b>8:30 to 10:00 PM</b> very, very spread out<b> J-Pod </b>whales headed south past <b>Lime Kiln</b> - at least the <b>J14s and J16s</b> were present. It got too dark before we could see if the rest of Js came down with them! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<b>5:40 - </b>Stephanie Raymond called from the Victoria Clipper with <b>four Transients off Partridge Point</b> (west side of north-central Whidbey Island). She saw one adult male and three females or juveniles heading roughly NW.

There were <b>over 20 Bigg's Killer Whales and 16 Resident Killer Whales</b> in our waters today. We decided to spend our time with the the northern groups of Bigg's with just a couple of other boats <b>just south of Nanaimo</b>. The whole time we were with them they alternated between eating Pacific Harbour Seals and socializing. The youngsters were packing seal carcasses with them and clearly very happy about it. - Simon Pidcock
