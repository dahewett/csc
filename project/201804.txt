<b>Hood Canal - T65As</b>
<br/><b>4:27 p.m. -</b> Granddaughter says she saw them from her school bus still <b>heading Northbound passing Eagle Creek</b>.
<br/><b>3:58 p.m. - They passed Lilliwaup </b>continuing northbound about 45 minutes ago. Waiting at Jorsted Creek to see if they continue north.
<br/><b>3:00 p.m. - Still mid-channel northbound approaching Lilliwaup</b>.
<br/><b>2:28 p.m. - saw them at Glen Ayr Resort closer to the West side</b> of the canal but still mid- channel, heading Northbound. Waiting for them at Lilliwaup. -Paul Nelson Jr.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~ 2:15 p.m -</b> We saw them as we were headed south out of <b>Hoodsport</b>! They we're headed North. I saw the blow hole, then it rolled and flipped it's tail up. We were driving so couldn't see everything closely. I feel like we just spotted the baby, because we were debating if it was a Dall's Porpoise or Orca (but we've never seen a porpoise flip it's tail out of the water). WOW!!! So happy that this thread confirmed that we saw an Orca in the Hood Canal. I always tell my kids we won't see them that far south, and now we have! -Sara Kaugman-Bradstreet

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:43 p.m. -</b> Yep, saw them go in <b>Dewatto</b> from a viewpoint on the 101. -Keith Dixon

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Found them around<b> 11:00ish north of Ayock</b>. Saw the Chilkat, so thought it would be a good place to start. SAW THE BABY!!, although from a distance! Followed them to Eagle Creek Tavern, (large hamburger on their roof), where it appears they made a kill, (on the east side of the canal), as seagulls came in. When I left them, (<b>12:10</b>), they were <b>heading south again</b>. Tide still going out. -Harry Louch

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:50 a.m - Hood canal orcas south bound at Hama Hama</b> (heading south per Renee Beitzel). -Christopher Lewman

April 29 - Possession Sound - They're still here! <b>Sounders #44 (Dubknuck) and #53 (Little Patch)</b> greeted us south of<b> Hat Island</b>, followed by <b>#21 (Shackleton) and #22 (Earhart)</b> a little further north towards Port Susan. #44 and #53 were traveling together, as were #21 and #22, although later #44 appeared to have split off from #53. <b>#49 (Patch)</b> also made a brief appearance, keeping everyone guessing with a few rapid directional changes. This was our penultimate whale watch trip of the season in Langley before Mystic Sea returns to Anacortes. We wish the Sounders safe travels on their continuing migration north to their summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea, and look forward to welcoming them back again next year. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

On yet another glorious clear, sunny day, Mystic Sea left the dock to head south towards <b>Everett where Sounders #49 (Patch) and #383</b> traveled in tandem, their heart-shaped blows silhouetted against the backdrop of the Cascade mountains. One of our crew members, Richard Snowberger, took to the skies earlier with pilot Fred Lundahl for some aerial photography of whale feeding pits around Whidbey, always a fascinating sight. Later on our trip we found two gray whales feeding in Port Susan, displaying the skill they have achieved in perfecting this high-risk feeding strategy so close to shore. <b>Grays 49 &amp; 383</b> traveling side by side. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photos Richard Snowberger, Crew)

Whales inshore and offshore today, with our first encounter just five minutes after leaving Langley Marina. #531's heart-shaped blow was clear to see as she headed from the deeper water towards the beach for a tasty snack of ghost-shrimp.

April 21 - Our morning trip began in sunshine and relatively smooth water, and we quickly found gray whale <b>#531</b> about a half mile <b>north of Fox Spit </b>on Whidbey Island. We then turned south and caught up with <b>#49, Patch at the south end of Camano Island</b>. Both were in fairly shallow water, so were not tail fluking, but we got good looks at their distinctive side and back patterns. Patch has especially distinctive markings, with his namesake big white patch on his back.  
<br/>For the afternoon trip, the wind came up and the clouds moved in, but we spent some great time with #49 again, then moved north, toward some big heart shaped blows in the distance around Baby Island. However, one of our sharp-eyed passengers spotted <b>#22, Earhart, off Fox Spit</b>. As we were admiring her,<b> #383</b> showed up! They were traveling north at a speedy (for gray whales!) 6 knots, and engaging in some activity, throwing up their front pec fins and a half of a tail fluke. They both did lovely big fluke up tail dives, so we were able to confirm their identities. One the way back to the marina, we spotted an unidentified whale very close to shore, just north of Langley. Another lovely day on Saratoga Passage, as our time with our beloved Sounders draws to a seasonal end. It's been a privilege to spend time with these amazing animals since March, and be reminded how very lucky we are to share a habitat with them. Bon Voyage, as they head back up to their far north feeding grounds in a few weeks. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

Just got back from the <b>Hama Hama</b> Shellfish Company. Spent an hour, (<b>12 - 1:00</b>, Low tide was at 12'ish), watching <b>orcas</b> just North of the delta. I would guess they were feeding as they weren't moving in either directions. -Harry Louch 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:28 p.m. - </b>I am seeing about <b>3 orcas</b> on east side of Hood Canal out from <b>Hamma Hamma River</b>. Too far away for id photos. No direction of travel, appear to be feeding. -Gayle Swigart

April 19 - <b>Dalco Passage</b>/Puget Sound - <b>9:51 a.m - Three orcas seen in Pt Defiance Vashon ferry lanes</b>. Heading towards Gig Harbor shoreline on Vashon side then we lost sight of them. Like they went down for a feed. They were thrashing about. We think they looked like 3 males. Tall dorsals. -Amy Christensen-Burrows

April 19 - <b>Female gray whale 531 </b>feeding close in shore off <b>Fox Spit </b>today in the presence of a local human resident. The gray whale close encounters afforded around the shores of Whidbey Island have been stunning and has connected neighbors and community to each other as well as the whales in such meaningful ways. -Photo by Allie Hudec, April 19, 2018

April 19 - Case Inlet - <b>12:25 p.m. -</b> Just saw <b>a single Gray surfacing in Case Inlet at Vaughn Bay</b>. Headed around Rocky Point toward Allyn...<b>Only saw the one</b>, breached (surfaced) three times total before it disappeared around Rocky Bay Point. No photos or videos sorry. The whale was close to shore, headed North when it came up. Heard the whale blow first and looked to find it already submerged again except the back near the tail which never came out of the water. It was gray, white, and spotted with markings that look like circles. Quite symmetrical and white shaped marks all along both top sides. Hope this helps. -Janie Zumstein Powell

April 19 - Oak harbor area - We saw what looked like <b>a gray whale swimming oddly in Crescent Harbor</b> off Whidbey Island Naval Air Station at<b> 3:30</b> this afternoon (Thursday)...We didn't get photos since it didn't surface very much or for very long. (we asked for more details): It was swimming in small circles in water that was probably 6-8 ft. deep. From your description it could have been feeding. When it surfaced, it sometimes looked like it was on its side, other times it looked like it was swimming normally with its back on the surface. A few times we saw its side fins slapping the water. Hopefully it was just feeding, but we heard about a missing whale tangled in fishing gear. We have never seen a gray whale in Crescent Harbor before, especially so close to shore in the shallow water. (I would say it is a feeding gray whale - and Crescent Harbor happens to be one of the places our grays feed, more than usual this year though.- SB) -Tom Lowman

<b>2:35 p.m. - #531 was the Baby Island</b> whale. She moved along the bluffs of Baby Island Hts westbound then turned left into Holmes Harbor and started feeding just south of Baby Island. She rolled around and fed for about 20 minutes then headed back north. She exited the Harbor, went a bit north then turned and she is now <b>mid way between Baby Island and the old Orca Network headquarters off North Bluff Road</b>, still well south of Hidden Beach community. Just before heading off island I was graced with some more time watching 531 roll around feasting on shrimp. She tucked into Holmes Harbor and fed for a short time just south of Baby Island. A touching beautiful sunny warm Wednesday moment with a big whale.  
<br/><b>1:35 p.m. - Two grays:</b> One gray at <b>entrance to Holmes Harbor</b> westbound near Green buoy off Baby Island close in AND 2nd gray about <b>1-2 miles north of Baby Island</b> NE bound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

April 18 - Saratoga Passage - We had a very unique experience on Chilkat Express today with <b>3 of our Sounders in Saratoga Passage</b>.  <b>Gray whales 21, 22, and 383</b> were traveling closely together at a slow pace close to Langley when all of a sudden they picked up the speed and started some aggressive behavior towards each other at the surface. <b>383 breached 3 times</b> in a row and the whales started peduncle throws towards each other as they continued southward to Hat Island. This went on for about 20 minutes and then all 3 whales  calmed down and things went back to normal. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Chilkat Express

April 18 - Hood Canal - ...drove to <b>Hama Hama</b>. Elk in the meadow of the Hama Hama river and eagles on the way up, but no Orcas.  ... On the way back at one stop looking from the North to the South I saw <b>a nice blow....It could have been a gray</b>, as the spout was fairly high &amp; strong. However, I wanted it to be an Orca. Watched that area for awhile, but didn't see anything else. -Harry Louch

April 17 - Possession Sound - <b>7:58 p.m. -</b> Hey I'm curious is there <b>a humpback whale</b> hanging around by the <b>Clinton/Muk Ferry</b>? I just saw what appeared to be a humpback but could have been a gray too. It was just off the Clinton Ferry terminal but it dove before I could get a direction. The mate and I both thought we saw a hump on it's back but I haven't heard of any humpbacks in the area, but we only saw it breach a little bit and then dive so it could have just been the angle and the water. The back of the whale looked pretty dark and smooth, usually grays spout water and this one wasn't and wasn't very active. (<i>gray or humpback</i>) -Melissa Simmons

Hidden Beach/Saratoga Passage - <b>5:25 p.m. - 8:15 p.m. Arrived to Hidden Beach</b>, Whidbey at 5:25 and <b>3-4 grays were feeding</b> close in shore slowly making their way south along the shoreline swimming all over each other stirring up the water as they fed on ghost shrimp in the sand. Around 6:00pm they suddenly took off at high rate of speed where we thought we were saying goodbye, then just as quickly circled back slowed their pace and headed back down to the deepest end of the the bay. At this point there were only 3, so we either were incorrect or one continued south as <b>21, 22, &amp; 383</b> circled back. The spent the next 3 hours feeding along the shore moving through the bay at Hidden Beach, circling back wide then moving in again. They repeated this many times. We left them at near dark now in glassy calm waters under a moody dark sky. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

April 15 - Saratoga Passage - <b>6:30 p.m. -</b> Having a bite with Marilyn Armbruster at <b>Village Pizzeria</b> when they rang their whale bell. Everyone in the place moved over to the windows to see at least <b>one gray whale</b> feeding very close in shore off downtown <b>Langley</b>! We downed some of our food &amp; drink, packed the rest to go and hauled our butts down the stairs at Boy and Dog park to catch up with  <b>PCFG #185</b> who was moving steadily along Seawall Park eastbound feeding along his way just from shore! The park ends so we watched him continued on, we then moved east and tried to relocate him. Last sighting was off the tug parked at the Langley Marina somewhere around<b> 7:20-7:30?</b> We searched, but couldn't relocate him. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

April 15 - Saratoga Passage - <b>4:00 p.m. -</b> We made it just in time to <b>Fox Spit to see Grays 21, 22, &amp; 383</b> now on the southside tip of East Point rustling around in the shallows together feeding on ghost shrimp buried in the sand. Barely had time to get out of the car and run to sit seaside just feet from these beautiful giants. They spent the next 20 minutes moving south along the shore, their bodies writhing, pec and flukes rising as they lay on their sides digging up shrimp. They continued along the shores towards Bells Beach. A most wonderful intimate encounter shared with many on shore. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Mystic Sea hosted a fundraising cruise for Orca Network on Sunday afternoon. An unexpected treat was having John Calambokidis from Cascadia Research Collective speak to our passengers prior to departure, with great updates on our local "Sounders" gray whale population.  We headed north from Langley and were treated to <b>3 whales feeding along the shoreline of Whidbey Island. #21 Shackleton, #22 Earhart and #383 (no name)</b>. It's a privilege to see this amazing feeding behavior - showing a pectoral fin and half of their fluke (tail) as they feed on their side in the shallow water. It's unknown where else this feeding behavior has been seen.  We also found another whale by Mabana on Camano Island (#531), also feeding along the shore. Thank you Mystic Sea for the great day, and providing good weather! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Today was Welcome the Whales day in Langley - and we did it in style. After leaving the dock Mystic Sea headed <b>north in Saratoga Passage</b> where <b>Sounders #21, #22, #383 and #531</b> were intermittently resting and feeding between Hidden Beach and Camano Island. New research is finding that, although gray whales are not a pod animal, they seem to be associating more together while spending their annual sojourn in Puget Sound away from the main migration. Judging from the large number of scoters near Baby Island competing with some playful California sea lions, there must be plenty of good food around. As the colorful parade arrived at Whale Bell park and the blessing of the whales ceremony took place, their blows could be seen not too far away. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

April 13 - Saratoga Passage - What an incredible experience this afternoon... I've seen <b>gray whales</b> many times from a boat and at a distance from shore, but I've never seen a gray whale feeding off Whidbey within 100 yards of the beach FROM the shore. <b>Sounder #21 (Shackleton) spent a couple of hours meandering between Whale Bell park and the Dog and Boy park, Langley</b> in his quest for food, digging down deep into the sand for that "oh-so-tasty" ghost-shrimp. It certainly heralded well for tomorrow's Welcome the Whales event in Langley, and was a fascinating insight into how these whales have perfected this high risk strategy of feeding in shallow water. -Sandra Pollard

<b>4:45 p.m. - T137s </b>made it to yellow mid channel buoy out from <b>Kayu Kayu ac Park in Richmond Beach</b>, south of Kingston and have now flipped.

April 9 - Saratoga Passage/Penn Cove - <b>7:00 p.m.  </b>- Mary Jo Adams is watching <b>a gray whale feeding in Crescent Harbor</b>, north of Oak Harbor. More later emailed with photos: Some folks who were out there watching this evening asked me if it was the same one that was there this morning so I guess there was one there then as well. It was feeding right in behind the boat ramps on the seaplane base.  I did not see much of the tail flukes but have some pictures of the flipper that he was holding up in the air and more of the back area.  Hope you can ID it! -Mary Jo Adams

About <b>6:00</b> this evening, three gray whales traveled down mid-passage <b>between Langley and Pebble Beach</b>, taking their time with shallow dives and lots of blows.

Monday April 9th - heading northbound on a truly beautiful sunny day, within minutes of leaving Langley we'd found <b>#49 Patch</b> heading to the shallower water along Whidbey's coastline. He showed off his beautiful fluke (tail) to us a few times, then we headed further north and found <b>THREE whales feeding</b> - hugging the shoreline, southbound. Fun to see their pectoral fin and half their tail as they scooped up the bottom sediment, finding ghost shrimp. These three were<b> ID'd as #21 Shackleton, #22 Earhart, and #383</b> (no name). The next whale we found was the new visitor,<b> CRC #185</b>, who was also feeding along the shoreline. We made it to Baby Island to see many California Sea Lions, and harbor seals and a few harbor porpoise, but wait - <b>another whale was in Holmes Harbor</b>! This was #531 (no name) and we had some great views of her in the mill-pond like conditions in Holmes Harbor. Wow - 6 whales, and sunshine. A great day on Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Tuesday it was moving north to south direction around midday, Wed. &amp; Thurs. late afternoon it was moving south to north. It is solitary.

What a whale of a weekend with Southern <b>Resident orcas off Whidbey Island</b>... With calmer weather conditions today we were fortunate to engage with members of J pod once again near Fox Spit, southbound in Saratoga Passage. There were numerous vigorous tail-slaps indicating that they were finding food followed by energized breaches, and for the most part the whales maintained their momentum slowing just occasionally for a spot of group socialization. With reports of transient orcas and <b>a humpback in the region</b> <b>along with our regular Sounders (gray whales)</b>, we wondered how many other whales we might see. As it was we encountered Sounder #531 near Langley Marina heading north, but no sign of the transients. The last we heard was that <b>they had turned tail and left ahead of the fast approaching residents, as the two eco-types do not interac</b>t. There are few places in the world offering such diversity of wildlife, and the privilege of watching these iconic species in their natural environment. <b>J38, J45  and probably J27 or L87 on his back.</b> -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photo below by Richard Snowberger, crew, zoomed and cropped).

What an amazing day on the water on the San Juan Clipper! We encountered <b>Gray Whale #383 near the SE side of Gedney/Hat Island</b> and saw him spyhop 3 times! Of course, I missed taking photos of them, except the end of one that's slightly out of focus. We left him as he cruised toward Everett, then met up with <b>J Pod in Saratoga Passage</b>! They were breaching like crazy, and again I only caught one, arrgh! But it was so good to see them again, we were even treated to a surprise close pass (engines were shut down). <b>J22 Oreo and J46 Star.</b> <b>J44 Moby under the watchful eye of his mother, J17 Princess Angeline.</b> -Justine Buckmaster

Today's encounter was pretty awesome. We didn't have much time and weather wasn't the greatest, but it was the first time I have seen anything black and white aside from the combination of the two. Gray whales people, gray whales.  First we encountered <b>#44 Dubnuck</b> and <b>#53 LP</b> hanging out together, then we headed north and found <b>Jpod as they foraged southbound</b>. The energy we saw from them when we first arrived was nothing short of amazing. I have never seen such explosive breaching in all my 12 years as a naturalist. Veterans of the area (as I am not) told me that that is how it used to be. It "used to be" because they had enough food and the time to be social and expend energy with little cost to their survival. Things have changed and they no longer have that luxury. With only 76 individuals, they are critically endangered. I am deeply saddened, but at the same time, I am holding out hope that they are finding enough spring "black-mouth chinook" (salmon that never go to open ocean) to keep their energy and social connections high. <b>J46 Star.</b>

<br/>(<i>Video sent to Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "I can't tell for sure either. One of the surfaces looked like it might have a more upright dorsal than the more curved fin of the bottlenose dolphins, and the dorsal seemed a little large for harbor porpoise, but there just wasn't enough resolution to be positive about any of it. Carr Inlet is a favorite hangout of the long-beaked common dolphins that have been down here, so I think that is most likely a common dolphin or a porpoise with a larger than normal dorsal fin, but I wouldn't count bottlenose out."</i>)

<b>1:12 p.m - </b>They were actively changing directions quite a bit (also on Mystic Sea this afternoon). They would go through periods of tail slapping, breaching, and spy-hopping and then be hard to find for a few minutes at a time. It was an amazing afternoon, though! <b>J42 Echo</b>, she's 11 years-old this year! -Amanda Marie Colbert

Mystic Sea left <b>J pod</b> still active off <b>Hidden Beach at around 1.00 pm</b>. When I left home this morning I expected to see transient orcas, not residents. I was as surprised as everybody else to discover that we were encountering Southern Resident orcas from <b>J pod in Saratoga Passage</b> today. I'm not even going to try and describe the indescribable - (actually I will) - spy-hops, breaches, tail slaps, side rolls, heads and tails, flukes and pecs, back rolls and more, every natural behavior seen in the wild that makes each encounter with these iconic whales so special. The lovely J38 powering along in Saratoga Passage! -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:34 a.m - at least 3 possibly 5 orcas!</b> We saw some spy hopping and mostly just milling around. Large dorsal fin stayed above water for a little while. At least 1 large orca and 2 smaller ones. They hung around for about 30 minutes. Haven't seen them for at least 15 minutes and no indication of which way they were headed. They were closer to Camano side. 
<br/><b>10:10 a.m - 3-5</b>, maybe more, orcas heading north in Saratoga. <b>1 mile south of Mabana</b>. -Jennifer Feldman Spanton

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:50 a.m -</b> This morning we had a very exciting view of a gray whale and one or two orcas. Regrettably, no photos that show more than a splash or a bump on the water surface. Directly off of the point at <b>Pebble Beach, Camano</b>, we looked up and saw the back third of a <b>gray whale's</b> body &amp; fluke diving nearly vertically into the water. As we watched it move on to the northwest, we noticed an<b> orca dorsal fin</b> very close to the gray's back as it came up. Lots of splashing, fins in and out of the water, and moving quickly. We followed it with the binocs, and the splashing continued as they moved on, and an second orca dorsal came up. 
I hopped in the car and drove to Mabana, but they had already passed by traveling towards Camano Island State Park. -Peg Boley

<br/><b>7:23 a.m - Orcas </b>right now just <b>south of the Clinton Ferry </b>crossing. Appears to be a male and maybe two others, looked like females headed north. They are about a mile off the Clinton dock headed towards Hat Island/Saratoga Passage. I'm only seeing dorsal fins so it's hard to tell if it's a small female of possibly a young calf. -Melissa Simmons, WSF

<b>10:15 a.m - Grey whale</b>. I saw a whale in Meerkirk bay (a.k.a. <b>Dines Point</b>) about 10:15 AM this morning Saturday 7th April. The whale was on its own, moving west along the bay then turning north towards <b>Greenbank</b> and North Bluff. My attention was first drawn to the whale due to the noise it was making, rather like a roar. When I got to the shore line I saw the whale's head rising out of the water as it came up to breathe. The whale was in view for about 15 minutes as it headed north, rising to the surface to blow water from its blowhole then dropping below the surface. 48 4' 32"N, 122 33' 1"W. -Andrea Linton

<b>7:10 p.m. -</b> on April 7, 2018, my husband &amp; I spotted <b>two gray whales</b> heading south in the Saratoga Passage from our home in <b>Greenbank</b>. They appeared to feeding, but too far away to really see. Event lasted about 15 minutes. Mostly we saw the spouting action as they came to surface, but one time, part of one whale came up out water - don't know if was its' head or tail. Best guess feeding &amp; traveling. Middle Saratoga Passage - east of Hidden Beach. -Kathryn Daberko

Deceased gray whale
April 3 initial report: 
<br/>We at Orca Network/Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network
received a report on April 3rd of a deceased gray whale on a Whidbey Island beach. A team of our Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network (CPSMMSN) volunteers conducted an initial examination that day and a full necropsy was conducted by Cascadia Research Collective and a team today April 5th. It is a common and sad occurrence to have several gray whales die in our region during their migration north, as they head back to their feeding grounds after a long journey south to mating and breeding lagoons. 
<br/>
If you see this Whale on the beach, please keep your distance, and remember it is a federal crime to collect any marine mammal parts without a permit from NOAA Fisheries. Researchers can learn a lot from stranded whales and other marine mammals, and we ask the public to leave the whale alone in her final resting place. 
Cascadia has provided an intial update from todays exam (below), we will provide updates as more information becomes available. To report stranded marine mammals in Island, Skagit or N Snohomish counties, contact the CPSMMSN/Orca Network at 1-866-ORCANET or info@orcanetwork.org
<br/>____________________

April 5th update by Cascadia Research: 
<br/>A young female gray whale that was first reported dead on the west side of Whidbey Island on Tuesday 3 April 2018 was examined today (5 April) by a team that included responders from Cascadia Research, SR3, Central Puget Sound Stranding Network, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The whale was just under 30 feet long and determined to be emaciated and the poor nutritional condition was likely a principal factor in its death. The thorough examination did not reveal any indications of trauma from ship strike or signs of entanglement but a wide range of tissues were collected for examination for pathology, disease, biotoxins, and contaminants. The unique markings on this whale did not match any of the more regular individuals that are typically seen in this region and cataloged by Cascadia Research and was likely one of the more than 20,000 gray whales that migrate past Washington each year in spring. The primary period for strandings of gray whales is April, May, and June so we are still early in this period.

I'm forwarding this orca report (Orcas spotted in <b>Saltair</b>: "I see the <b>T37As</b> in the link photos, Melisa Pinnow, CWR). which was sent to me by my mother's neighbor, Brenda. The whales were visible from Mum and Brenda's condos, which overlook <b>Transfer Beach in Ladysmith, near Saltair</b>, which is between Nanaimo and Victoria B.C. on Vancouver Island. Mum didn't actually see them as we were on a Skype call at the time i.e. Monday, April 2 at <b>10:00 am</b>. Brenda (Bailey) sent another pic which I'll forward - she found it on another Facebook site and did not take it herself. (we forwarded that photo to Melisa Pinnow, CWR :"The male looks like <b>T49A1 maybe</b>.") -Cheers, Sandra Pollard

Coastal killer whales - April 2 -<b> Orcas in Oregon off the Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Newport, OR</b>. <b>At least 7 or 8</b> (that showed up in my pictures simultaneously - most likely several more. One (maybe two) of the orcas circled a Gray Whale for several minutes but did not appear to attack it. The rest of the pod had moved South by then. -Pike Bremer
<br/>(<i>ID notes Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research:  "Those are <b>Ts</b> but not sure who."</i>

<b>SEVEN whales today</b>!! No April Fool's joke either! Just after leaving port on calm seas, we found <b>#383 and #531</b> feeding together between Hat/Gedney Island and Sandy Point on Whidbey. Then <b>#21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart</b> were spotted together just east of Camano Head. Capt Eric then spotted another "blow" and we had quick views of the "new" visitor in town, <b>CRC 185</b>, before continuing to SE Hat/Gedney Island where we found <b>#49 Patch </b>feeding along the shallow bank, and we also found <b>#53 Little Patch</b> a little further west. What a thrill for our passengers - and our crew - to see so many gray whales in such a small area of Possession Sound! Well done, Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

At <b>1:40 p.m. -</b> Eric from Mystic Sea called the Langley Whale Center to report: 
<b>#383 &amp; #531 between Gedney Island and Sandy Point. 
#21 &amp; #22 near Camano Head heading North into Port Susan. 
And #49, #53, and CRC-185 SE of Gedney Island.</b>

It's been quite a 24 hours on the <b>hydrophones</b>! Yesterday a sperm whale, and today the <b>T2Cs</b> who were chatty for well over an hour in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Today was also the first official day of our fourth field season and we were lucky enough to see the T2Cs early in the day and then have an extended acoustic encounter with them in the afternoon. Here's a CLIP of what we heard. -Monika Wieland Shields

April 1 - April Fool's Day? Not for passengers and crew on Mystic Sea, who soon caught up with Sounder <b>#383 and his companion 531 traveling in tandem near Hat (Gedney) Island</b>. Despite chilly, choppy conditions hardy sailors kept track of the whales while enjoying a mix of sea spray and whale breath blowing on the wind, before bidding the duo farewell and heading north in Saratoga Passage to catch up with a raft of barking, frolicking California sea-lions near Baby Island. No Easter bunnies on this trip, but half-a-dozen Bald Eagles dueling above the treetops waited to greet us on our return to the port of Langley on yet another adventure filled day. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
