Hello, I saw the post about the <b>unidentified dolphin at Kingston</b> the morning of Saturday 9/30. Probably the same individual passed by Hansville just off the beach maybe 1 - 2 hours earlier. We had never seen an orca before, so we assumed this was a small orca - it was black, and some of us thought we saw some white on the head. It was repeatedly porpoising to breathe at very regular intervals (100 - 200 feet or so?), but not enough to get the jaws or possibly even eyes out of the water, and blew a spout each time. We could hear the spout/breath from 200 yards. Was it really a dolphin? It was at least 12 feet long and moved a lot of water when it came up...-Rod Lundberg

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Dolphins - September 30 - North Puget Sound - This came by this morning <b>10:15 about 30 ft off shore, Apple Tree Point</b>. I thought it was Orca coming as it was very large (small for Orca) ID type? Steady southbound. From a distance could see a large dorsal fin but as it approached, was more clear. It was much bigger than what I've seen here before. -Sara Frey 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

September 30 - South Puget Sound - <b>10:00 a.m.  - South Puget Sound. Unknown number of common dolphins,</b> heading south into <b>Budd Inlet</b>, near the tip of Cooper Point. Very active and near the western shore. They are now out of sight. -Kim Merriman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

September 30 - Spotted a lone <b>minke whale near Port Madison</b>, north end of Bainbridge Island Saturday afternoon around <b>3pm</b>. Traveling. -Paul Riggs

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

September 30 - We saw it (the <b>bottlenose</b> - ALB) on the <b>southeast end of Bainbridge Island </b>heading south Saturday at <b>6:15 pm</b>. -Bridget Lockett

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

(Sara Frey report was in our previous Whale Sighting Report, including again with ID's by Cascadia Research Collective(CRC) staff)
This came by this morning <b>10:15 about 30 ft off shore, Apple Tree Point</b>. I thought it was Orca coming as it was very large (small for Orca) ID type?  Steady southbound. From a distance could see a large dorsal fin but as it approached, was more clear. It was much bigger than what I've seen here before. -Sara Frey 
<br/>"<i>Yes I think a <b>bottlenose dolphin</b>, which are occasional visitors to our area though their primary range is northern California and south." - John Calambokidis, CRC</i>
<br/><i>"My best guess would be <b>bottlenose</b>. There have been a couple that have come into the Sound in recent years, and the dorsal and rostrum look about right." - Dave Anderson, CRC</i>
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Dall's porpoise -</b> September 30 - Fall is definitely here...we left the marina in a light mist that shortly turned to rain. As we headed north through the San Juans, we received a report of "orcas heard on Lime Kiln hydrophones, but faint." We did come across about <b>20 lovely little Dall's porpoises</b> (who are not easy to photograph!), who sped around the boat, off <b>Middle Bank</b>. We had a great visit with the big handsome Steller Sea Lions at Whale Rocks, including one who is molting. A beautiful, damp, but lovely day on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

Sept 29th trip report - with news that <b>J-pod was near Partridge Bank</b>, we headed south in light rain, passing <b>Minor Island </b>on the way to check out the harbor seals and birds. With a photography group on board, we were rewarded with amazing action from J-pod whales, they were spread out over a large area but we were able to get good looks at them. Those most visible to us were <b>J27 Blackberry, and L87 Onyx</b>, both such beauties. Tons of breaching and huge tail slaps - it was SO GOOD to see them again. We even had sun on our return trip. Looking forward to seeing many more photos from today's trip, hoping members of the photography group will post to our page!! Stay tuned! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:00 p.m. - leaving them at Ft. Ebey. Members of Jpod </b>traveling north and a bit west with lots of activities mixed in.
<br/>11:40 a.m. - About 20 Residents, members of JPod identified plus L87. (Note: Yesterday and today L87 has remained pretty separate and lagging behind the rest of Jpod. Still right offshore slowly moving straight north along shore.
<br/><b>10:45 a.m. - J pod foraging off Ft Casey</b>. -Susan Marie Andersson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

People aboard the Coupeville to Port Townsend ferry crossing this morning had the good fortune to transect with J pod and L87 who were making their way north out Admiralty Inlet after their overnight stay inland Puget Sound. Pod of approximately <b>15 orcas seen at around 10:15 a.m. this morning while on a ferry boat from Coupeville to Port Townsend, WA</b>. They were spread out and traveling at a slow speed in the direction of Coupeville. A few were doing tail slaps. Coordinates: 48 08 419 N 122 41 134 W. What an awesome surprise to see them on our way to set up for my daughter's wedding tomorrow. I flew up from SoCal yesterday and wasn't expecting to see these beauties. -Robin Lowe

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

As of <b>9:05 am the orcas are off Admiralty Head</b>, with a large Coast Guard Cutter floating nearby enjoying the show! -Kathy Pulley

It was one of our more beautiful orca sightings with at least one breach, a couple leaps (do orcas leap?), and the glistening black and white very visible just with the naked eye. The porpoises, a sea lion, and a seal were all right in the same vicinity. -Called in by Marilyn Deroy

Watched them pass <b>between pt no pt and double bluff at 11:10-11:30 currently south of possession</b> seem to be trending south still. They were a bit active with some great lunges! Watching  from point directly across point no point. I saw a lot of fish jump! They were also seals, possibly a sea lion, and two small pods of porpoise went by. Calm waters, perfect temperature, sun in the sky it was gorgeous! -Photo by Melinda Barajas, September 28, 2017

September 27 - South Puget Sound - <b>9:00 a.m. -  4-6 Common dolphins in South Puget Sound</b>. They are traveling back and forth near the <b>mouth of Budd Inlet/Boston Harbor Marina</b>. Water is like glass. I can see them from across the bay. They are in the shadowed area near shore. The lighting is just right that I can actually see them exhale! Then as they surface, the sunlight glistens off their backs as they glide through the water. And without much fanfare, they explode into the air, creating the eruption of sunlit splashes. -Kim Merriman

At the end we were all (crew included) a boat full of smiles and amazement. We watched the<b> Southern Residents almost go through Active Pass (twice),</b> a huge group of B<b>igg's Orcas almost go through Active Pass</b> (once), we saw the Southern Resident orcas engaged in stunning social behavior, breaching <b>Humpback</b> whales, lots of wildlife, and gorgeous scenery.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

September 24 - (<i>reported as Fin whale. Based on size, description, further discussion, and reports of other minke in the area that day (and that we've had no other reports of a Fin whale inland this year) it is <b>presumed to be a minke</b> - ALB</i>) 
<b>6:30 p.m. - </b>We saw a single Fin <b>whale heading NNW out between Fort Casey and Port Townsend</b> at approximately 1830. Traveling.   48°08'56.3"N 122°42'23.4"W.
<br/>You are probably right that it was most likely a minke. I was looking through binoculars and I estimated that once if broke the surface there was about 12-16 feet between the front (not the head, just looked like the top of the whales back) and the fin. It then looked like another 4 to 6 feet until the body was under water (from the fin). So I guess that the part of the whale above the surface was somewhere between 16 to 22 feet long. I did not see a head or a tail. Both were under water. I saw it break the surface about 10 or 12 times over a 5 minute period. When I returned home, I looked up pictures on the internet to try to find one that looked like...the picture I found was of a fin whale but what I am not experienced at all so it very well may have been a minke. -Michael Colquhoun

September 23: On a day of beautiful fall sunshine and flat calm water, we headed out toward Lummi Island and caught up to a very large group (possibly at least 40!) of our Southern Resident orcas!!! What a treat to see them after such a long absence from their home waters. <b>We found them just at Towhead Island</b>, on the north side of Cypress Island, with multiple groups spread out across the water. Seeing very large <b>J26, Mike</b>, breaching and tail slapping, was awesome! We also got a good look at some of<b> L pod</b>, and a few of the approximately 2 year old calves of J and L pods. They continued south down Rosario Strait, grouping up at times, then spreading out again. We stopped to see harbor seals, a Steller sea lion, and many birds at Bird Rocks. After reluctantly leaving the whales at Colville Island, we took a scenic tour around the small islands close to Lopez Island, then under the Deception Pass bridge. -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist

September 21 - (<i>Again, reported as Fin but through further discussion she settled on <b>probably a Minke</b> -ALB</i>)
Just on the <b>tip of South Whidbey</b> and spotted a Fin whale. We were aware of the humpback in the vicinity. The whale only surfaced. There wasn't any breaching. Any pectoral slapping. We have had many experiences in MX with humpbacks. This animal did not appear to be a humpback. It could've been a minke. It was slender in size, dark grey, if I had to guess probably 12' long. It wasn't what struck me as a larger whale. When I look at fin whales, it did resemble the body shape, but the whale never did a full breach so we couldn't see underneath. When I look at the minke whale, the dorsal fin did resemble that as well. The dorsal fin was way more towards the rear of the whales body. Hope that helps. My husband is convinced it was a fin whale but it did look like it could be a minke as well. Were there any other reports of any other whales aside from the humpback? ...All good info. Probably not a fin whale then at that size. Probably a minke. My best guess. -Niboreel Sreyas

Those two were milling about near mid channel of the US side of the strait, close to the position above (probably 300 yards distant) as we floated we saw a total of six confirmed possible more whales heading west closer to shore on the US side, (probably 1/2 to 3/4 mile distant and an additional two milling behind us also roughly mid channel on the US side approximately 500 yards distant. Once the group had passed we continued to Anacortes. -Steve Marczewski

We had a magical encounter with <b>3 humpback whales ID'd as 'Heather' BCY0160, 'Divot' BCX1057 and 'Windy' MMY0006</b> on Sept 20th. They were found near <b>Skipjack Island</b> and travelled together in a tight group all the way down past Friday Harbor when we left them at <b>5:40pm</b>. -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

From the bluffs south of <b>Bush Point, Whidbey Island</b>, we stand in awe watching this breathtaking scene unfold before us as members of<b> J and L pods</b> pass northbound, in two large bunched up groups, their blows illuminated by the late afternoon September sun. What a beautiful surprise it was when they showed up for their first inland late Summer/early Fall 2017 foray into Puget Sound. We are so blessed they stayed overnight and hope they found plenty salmon during their time here. -Photo by Susan Berta, Orca Network, September 19, 2017

September 19 - Puget Sound - (Day report) We found them spread out and foraging scatter from <b>Useless Bay south towards Point No Point</b> (and beyond, most likely). They were actively feeding and there were even gulls around! I hope that means they were finding plenty of food. They continued to forage until the wake of a big container ship rolled through at which point they started surfing the wake and the juveniles nearby (<b>L113 and L121</b>) began breaching in the waves. Of course I wasn't ready with the camera but it will be forever ingrained in my mind. After that the whales began to slowly group up and socialize. They were EXTREMELY chatty. I'll message you a clip of that separately. At this point they were not directional, they would go north a bit and then come back south. They were still doing that when we started to leave the scene. As we did about 1/2 mile away Lpod grouped up and began porpoising together. Though distant it was amazing to see, especially those huge males! <b>Jpod</b> also grouped up and surfaced between us and Lpod in tight social groups, swimming north with purpose. They were social and playful as they went. We left them still heading north. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>6:30 p.m. - Two pods traveling north bound 10 minutes apart passing Bush Point</b> in the middle of channel. Moving quickly. -Lorie &amp; Guy Calkins

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:34 p.m. - Many many Rs in multiple groups moving north mid channel south of Bush Pt.
<br/>6:10 p.m. - large pod of orcas with several males heading N up Admiralty Inlet, 1 mile south of Bush Pt</b>. THIS TIME we believe they are the <b>Ls/Js</b> that have been hanging out in the Possession Triangle, finally heading north -
<br/><b>5:00 p.m. -  - The 5 or so probable Ts came south in mid-channel down Admiralty Inlet </b>accompanied by well-behaved whale watch boats <b>to about even with Foulweather Bluff at the entrance to Hood Canal. At that point they turned about, making a wide U-turn and heading back north.</b> They should be approaching Bush Pt. light about now. Meanwhile the Ls and Js who had been milling and foraging for hours between Possession Point and Point No Point were still there at 5PM. Could it be that the Ts came within acoustic range of the Rs and decided it would be prudent to turn around and avoid an encounter? They often turn around so there's no way to know, but it was an interesting U-turn when they reached about 7-8 miles from the Residents.
<br/><b>4:20 pm - At least 8 orcas 1 mile south of Bush Pt</b>, headed N, close to Whidbey side. We THINK these are maybe the Ls/Js that were off Possession Pt. earlier (?), however we had reports of a pod coming SOUTH in Admiralty Inlet that we were expecting to be here about now - hoping someone on the boats that are with the whales will kindly post any IDs here and help us out! -Susan Berta and Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b>3:40 p.m. - </b>The <b>orca</b> I earlier reported swimming south toward <b>Point No Point (from Possession Point)</b> are now heading North toward Double Bluff, and it looks like the NOAA Research boat is off Double Bluff as well. I believe the orcas that were off Marrowstone earlier (turned out to be Ts) are headed down our way and may be approaching the Bush Point area.
<br/><b>3:32 p.m. - </b>Seeing distant whales from our home/office <b>S. of Bush Point</b><b></b> through the "Big Eyes" - the orcas we can see are swimming south toward<b> Point No Point</b>, but it could be the larger group is just milling/fishing in the "Possession Triangle" between Point No Point, S.

Aboard the <b>11:10am Edmonds to Clinton ferry</b>: while still at port I see an adult male and a few others (including wee one) grouped up heading northbound south and west of the ferry terminal. I see another group closer inshore. Just as the ferry begins to depart I then see more (first just the blows) beyond the jetty off south end of the marina very close to shore (at least 4-5 separate blows). As we left the dock they were all south of us, with those furthest offshore off our bow...by the time we met up with them the others were now at our stern. I then ran to the back decks (squealing with excitement and telling all the passengers who we were seeing along the way) to watch spread out  groups who I later learned included Js with the Ls heading steady northbound. People lined the interior windows and the outer decks to watche these beauties. As fate would have it, on my time to get away, I was gifted a crossing with these beloveds. Heart is a lot more full at this moment. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Just one from tonight as my eyes are shot from the smoke. After watching <b>Transients come out of Sinclair Inlet and into Rich Passage</b>, I took a painfully long detour to <b>South Beach (Bainbridge Is.</b>). I was sitting on the bench there, not knowing if I was behind or ahead of the whales, when I heard the first blow. Then I heard a second much closer and louder. They swam by so close, and it was just me and the whales.<b> T36B, T36B1 and T37A1</b>. -Photo by Connie Bickerton, September 16, 2017

On September 16th we encountered <b>6 of the 9 whales in the T65A and T99 matrilines</b>, pictured here (see photo below).This encounter for us was in <b>San Juan and Spieden Channels</b><b></b> in the evening about<b> 5-6 PM</b>. It's not unusual for some members of a group to seemingly "appear" and "disappear" throughout an encounter, but apparently this was a bit of a longer separation than usual, because our next two transient encounters included those "missing" three whales and not the rest of their families! It seems unusual to us that <b>T65A3 (age 10), T65A4 (age 6) and T99B (age 10)</b> would separate from their families for several days at their age, so we're wondering if it was an intentional separation or if they "got lost", but we will never know for sure! We did hear today, however, that the three roaming sub-adults were reunited with their mothers today! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

San Juans - Trip Report from 9/15/17 <b>3:30 - 7:30 PM</b> - Departed Friday Harbor aboard J1 heading out into San Juan Channel where we encountered lone male <b>T049A1 just off the shore of Lopez Island</b> with some directional changes and long dives, possibly looking for dinner. We had a few looks at him but he eventually did a long dive of several minutes crossing the distance more than halfway over to the San Juan Island shoreline. We left him and headed up to <b>Kanaka Bay in Haro Strait where we found the T123's</b> accompanied by a NOAA research skiff. They were traveling in a group very close to shore. Mind blowing to see T's in the kelp beds off Eagle Point in September which is where we should be seeing southern residents foraging for Chinook. They traveled south and did a large circle south of Cattle Point at one point heading directly into the majestic peak of Mt. Rainier visible on a clear and calm evening from more than 100 miles away. At this point they had also separated with T123 and T123C traveling closely together and T123A always about a mile away, still well within vocal range. We left them to travel out toward Hein Bank to see if we could find a humpback that had been spotted earlier in the day and encountered a small group of four Pacific white-sided dolphins who played in our wake at times. Leaving them, we almost immediately encountered a minke whale who was surfacing frequently and we got at least a half dozen good looks at this slim, sleek baleen whale. We then pointed back towards San Juan Channel and got many more looks at the T123's still traveling in the split grouping but directionally pointed into San Juan Channel with the Cascades alpenglow making them appear dreamlike. At one point we were drifting idle looking at T123A about 300-400 yards on the starboard side, when T123C surfaced very close to the port side. The engine was immediately shut down and T123 came up within feet of the boat, rolled on her side and looked up. As darkness became imminent, we went over to take a look at Steller sea lions hauled out and vying for real estate with one another as we pondered if one of these giant mammals would eventually become a Friday night feast for the T123's coming up behind us. There is no prettier place on the planet than the Salish Sea in September! -Debbie Stewart 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 
 
While the Southern Residents were here, there were only <b>2-3 groups of transients spotted per day in the Salish Sea</b>. Now that the Residents have left again, <b>we were back up to 10 groups of transients in the Salish Sea today</b>. <b>The T123s (including T123A Stanley</b>, pictured here) in <b>Haro Strait </b>were just one of them. Coincidence? Do we not find transients as much when we have residents to look at, or do the transients clear out when the residents are here? -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, September 15, 2017

September 15 - Thought I would share an Orca sighting from 9/15/2017 (<b>8:30 a.m.</b>). Was trolling (fishing) Puget Sound, just south of <b>Richmond Beach </b>when behind me, to my left, maybe 200 yards we spotted <b>an Orca, T137A</b>. It was heading south as well. Was the only boat in the area at the time. Saw the Orca go down and 10 seconds later it surfaced about 30ft off my right side. Must have just wanted to check us out because it altered its path south to make a loop around me. I also thought it strange to see a lone Orca. I've seen the pods go by in the past but never a single Orca. Attached a couple pictures I was able to take and one shows some pretty good tail markings. If you're able to tell me the Orca number by those markings that would be pretty neat. Also, maybe a couple hours later I saw the Edmonds whale watching boat heading South as well.

September 15 - Admiralty Inlet -<b> 9:45 a.m. -</b> We saw a small <b>Humpback</b>). Too big for a sea lion and not an orca. Surfaced many times. It did look like an irregular dorsal fin. There was definitely a fin though.  Heading north about 150 ft from shore. <b>Smugglers Lagoon Lane , Greenbank.</b> It's just north of S Whidbey State Park on the west wide of Whidbey Island. Would love to know if others were able to give it a positive id. -Nancy Ritzenthaler

Gray whales - September 15 - We saw <b>a single grey whale at 5:30 pm</b> this evening in <b>Holmes Harbor </b><b></b>right at Dines Point. It was small. Maybe a baby. That's the best shot I got. I was so fascinated by watching it. It came up for breaths 4 times. Each time it was pretty close to the shore, maybe 50 feet away from me. I'm pretty sure it was feeding. It was small, maybe a baby? We could clearly see the barnacles on it, and it was light in color. Each time it surfaced we could hear the exhalations, short but loud enough to hear. In fact, that's how I first saw it, I heard it out there and then I turned around to see it. It was going south, into Holmes Harbor around 5:30 last night. About 30 minutes later we saw it again, farther out, maybe 200 feet or so, and it was headed north west, towards Greenbank Farm. It surfaced 2 more times that time, and we got to see much more of the body, longer and out of the water a little longer each of those times. It was clearly a Gray. -Debi Wayland

September 15 - WA coast - We lucked out at <b>Kalaloch Beach</b> on Friday with grey whales passing close to shore and feeding in the surf. They looked near enough to walk out to, but we respected the 100 yard distance regulation and were too scared of the water anyway! Seeing their blows highlighted against the blue of the sea and sky and watching them feed in the shallows was an unexpected treat and a booster to the soul. -Sandra Pollard/Richard Snowberger

Watched <b>orcas from just north of Clinton Ferry terminal to Langley 4:45 - 6:30 pm</b>. First saw them in the ferry lanes, somewhat closer to the Whidbey side, active and splashing...pretty sure hunting and killing prey...hard to narrow down photos, but truly I did. There were around 7 of them, at least 2 males and a young one and 4 females, just making the best guess...Still in awe, loved hearing them breathe and exhale. There is something about shore/land based whale watching, hard to explain... some of the photos zoomed, most are cropped.

September 14 - Trip with <b>Humpbacks</b>! <b>Humpback BCY0409 "Yogi" off San Juan Island.</b> Orca reports today had those whales far south, far west and far north - so we headed towards <b>Cattle Pass to find two humpbacks</b> reported traveling southbound. We found them in beautifully calm seas, and had excellent views as they continued on their journey, with a lot of diving and showing of their flukes (tails). Lots more wildlife to see, by Smith/Minor Islands we found Tufted Puffins, lots of harbor seals hauled out and at Bird Rocks a bunch of Steller Sea Lions enjoying the sun. No two days are alike on the Salish Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Monday morning Mystic Sea left port with warm air, sunny skies, and flat calm waters. We first cruised to Colville where we stopped to see harbor seals lounging about in one of their favorite places. We continued on towards <b>Salmon Bank</b> where we were so thankful to find members of<b> L-pod</b> (finally!), including the <b>L12s</b>. We stayed with L-pod for the day, and Mystic Sea passengers and crew saw something that is very rare - <b>L85 (also known as Mystery) swimming alongside a juvenile minke whale</b>! One of our crew members caught a short video of them surfacing near each other, as everyone looked on excitedly. To round out an already amazing day, Captain Eric cruised us to Smith Island where we found nearly 20 puffins and Minor Island where additional harbor seals could be seen. We were back at port by 4pm with a fantastic day of whales and wildlife etched in our memories. -Amy W., Mystic Sea

September 11 - Today on 9/11/17 at <b>2:45pm</b> we were approximately 3 miles northeast of the RA buoy headed back <b>towards Cattle Pass when a minke whale breached</b> in the distance twice, lunged in the water twice, and then breached again! There were Southern Resident orcas in the area including <b>L25</b> who was about 250 yards away from him, and <b>L41</b> who was about 400 yards on his other side. We also heard on the radio that there was <b>a small juvenile minke whale hanging out near L85</b>....We saw another <b>minke</b> in the distance who was traveling towards <b>L77 and L119</b>.

September 10 - Juan de Fuca - An incredible trip today with three different species of whale - <b>transient orcas, a humpback and a Minke</b>. Time of<b> transient encounter was 1:00 pm at Eastern Bank </b>(Strait of Juan de Fuca) The <b>T65As</b> joined forces with the <b>T99s</b> to make a formidable foe for the resilient harbor seal on their radar, fighting hard for survival. The orcas worked cooperatively and systematically to wear down their prey, leaving much of the work to the younger members of the group. This was nature in the raw with the full power of the ocean's top predator in sharp contrast to our later encounter with the gentle humpback and Minke baleen whales. The HB and the Minke were both in the same area between Smith and Minor Islands and NAS Whidbey spotted 2:45pm. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<b>7:22 p.m. -</b> Last I saw they were heading north on the <b>east of Vashon towards Pt Robinson</b>, we were at Brown's Point! We left about 5 mins ago.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:25 p.m. - </b>I was sitting on the deck of the <b>Tacoma Yacht Club facing out toward Vashon Island</b> when I saw what I thought were <b>orca whale fins</b> emerge from the water. A small sailboat was nearby, and I saw it maneuver to give the whales some distance. I saw a <b>large male, and one or two females</b>. They each surfaced a number of times. They were too far for me to capture on my phone, but I was so thrilled to see them. I grew up in Tacoma, and I've only seen orcas once in the South Puget Sound, so this was exciting! I thought they were feeding at first, because there were 2-3 whales just east of the Pt. Defiance-Tahlequah ferry path between Pt. Defiance and Vashon, and they appeared to stay in one spot for a little bit. However, then they started to travel, and I saw them surface around Neill Point and then glimpsed them again near Piner Point. 47°19'44.6"N 122°30'20.7"W. -Maria Manza

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We saw them from the ferry on <b>Vashon (we were headed back to Pt. Defiance) at approx 6:25 p.m.</b> Looked like they were right off the Point headed east towards the ferry dock at the time. Saw at least <b>3 different whales</b> surface at once. Very exciting! -Tishelle Atkins Ward

6:18 p.m. - <b>Passed the point at 6:05, heading into Vashon inlet currently at 6:18</b>. last I saw they were headed into this area (indicated Dalco Pass, south Maury/Vashon). Boats are still over there (6:36) but I'm on a paddleboard at Owen beach so I can't really get closer. -Britt Birdhouse

We got to see <b>T137A</b> travelling north today from the <b>Narrows Bridge to Pt. Defiance</b>. One of the remakarable observations was seeing a Sea Lion near our boat with Orca's travelling about a 1/4 mile away or less at Pt Defiance. T he Sea Lion came up with a fish in his mouth as the Orca's travelled away. Usually we don't see Sea Lions or Harbor Seals anywhere near the T's. I think the Orca fed well in the south sound. -Zeno Martin

We got to spend an hour watching an <b>Orca family</b> hunt down their Sunday dinner along <b>Narrows Beach in Gig Harbor</b>! There was a large male (<b>T137A</b>), two smaller adults and an adorable Juvenile. At the 4:00 mark of the video there are three tail slaps and a nice side fin slap too. That slap was so loud it sounded like a crack of lightning! At the 6:15 mark you can see the male appear to do an end-over-end underwater. A mini-jump at 9:35. Thanks to the Orca network and all the followers for all you do! Hope you enjoy. -Mark Schurer

September 9 - <b>Puget Sound</b> - Who doesn't love a good breach shot, or a spyhop?! Not one person will tell you they don't. In fact I LOVE spyhops. BUT, I think what I love even more than either of those is when a <b>killer whale</b> surfaces right next to the boat and the water is flat calm. Conditions need to be right for it to work, but I think this mini series shows what I mean. Seeing them underwater and then gliding to the surface to take a breath is a complete moment of zen for me. Lucky for me, my subject, <b>T36B1</b> and the water around him/her were very cooperative. -Renee Beitzel

I've only ever seen something like this once before, and it was in Monterey Bay, California in 2014. But as we got on scene last night it was almost a flashback to that Sunday morning when I'd watched a group of nearly 30 California transient killer whales take down a gray whale calf. It was different whales, a different place, different prey, but the scale was the same. The smell, the sounds, the mood.  We could see the slick before we had reached the whales. It was huge, stretching for over a mile and you could trace it's path through the waves to where the whales were actively feeding. It was two families we know well---the <b>T65As and the T99s</b>. Two excellent moms, two excellent hunters.
<br/>The gulls had gathered by the hundreds and they hovered over the whales, even when we couldn't see them, waiting for any scrap they could snatch up. We saw some with pieces of blubber, squabbling with the others as they tried to steal it. The whales didn't notice them, they were too busy feasting and playing. The youngsters rolled in the waves, pec slapping and tail lobbing. Sometimes even launching themselves in a half breach between long dives.
<br/>The passengers on board were hearty souls, braving the rolling seas for glimpses of something rarely seen here in these inland waters. Their own observations sparked questions: Do they eat it all? How long will it take them? What was it? How did they kill it? I explained their tactics in hypotheticals, we didn't witness it after all. I told them what parts they seem to prefer, generally of course, we've never witnessed these particular families taking a whale down before. I assured them that even though the whales wouldn't eat it all, nothing would go to waste.
<br/>In all the time we spent with them they didn't move. We left them where we found them, still feeding. It was incredible to witness, even just the aftermath of what must have been an epic hunt, and I feel a great privilege in having been there to see it in the first place. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

September 8 - Admiralty Inlet - We headed north today around Blakely Island, through Peavine Pass, scouting in the very foggy conditions for whales. The fog persisted as we headed out Cattle Pass, with a brief stop at Whale Rocks to check on the Steller sea lions. Continuing southward, we eventually received a report of <b>whales by the Port Townsend ferry</b>! Off we traveled and it was well worth it - Transient/Biggs killer whales - the <b>T28s</b> - rarely seen in the Salish Sea were off Admiralty Head, and heard whispers that the T124s were with them! Good to see these whales, lots of tail slaps and some great looks at them. It was a 100 mile round trip today - but well worth the long trip! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

I told Moby (their dog) the whales were coming, and he spent the next hour on his 'whale rock' we call it on point waiting to let us know when they were here. This guy is in doggy heaven here, loves the whales! So literally less than 5 minutes before these <b>Ts</b> swam by, two large males together close to shore on the Kitsap side, and several females paralleling them 1 mile across tight to Vashon, I see this guy (again) snoozing on my boat. (here was a seal on the stern of Tim's anchored sailboat)  But he went into the water just minutes before they came by. I thought we were going to witness some activity, kind of hoped for it as this juvenile delinquent testosterone rich seal has been very aggressive making me paddle him off the boat when I row out to sail. Then he takes over my dingy until I get back, seemingly waiting for his big boat! And then these guys popped up right in front of the house...God I love living here!...-Tim Ferris

Friday evening I was alone on the beach and got a chance to see Transient orcas (<b>T101's, T36B's, T36, T37A) pass by Cove on Vashon Island</b>. The sun was going down, the water was flat, still, and all I could hear was the sound of orcas surfacing and breathing before they disappeared under the water again. Catching orcas twice in one week, hope there is more to come this season. -Photo by Kelly Burns Keenan, September 8, 2017

September 7 &amp; early hour of 8th - Saratoga Passage - My wife and I were fortunate enough to see and hear <b>orcas</b> for our first time, tonight. I first heard a heavy breathing sound about 200 yards off shore at around <b>8:45pm</b> at 2300 block <b>Hidden Beach drive, Greenbank</b>. I just checked again at <b>12:15 AM</b> 9/8/2017 and more breathing noises in very calm waters. Extremely humbling experience and somewhat sad as I read they may be having difficulty finding food. There are too many of us on the planet. Thank you for the work you do. To complete the report as requested. 2 confirmed 5-6ft dorsal fins swimming together. First headed southbound towards Baby island but then 3 1/2 hrs later we could hear more breathing off shore about 200 yes from our bulkhead. There were two other females at the 8:45 pm sighting. Behavior was breaching, blowing steam and what I would characterize as feeding given distance covered in seconds. -Michael Curneen

September 7 - East Bank - No whale reports so we headed in the smoky haze towards <b>Lopez Island and found a humpback whale</b> - waiting for us!

After some quick looks we headed towards a new orca report - south towards<b> Eastern Bank where we found Transient/Biggs killer whales, T18, T19 and T19C -</b> had a nice visit with them which rounded out the day. Every day is different - who will we see tomorrow? Can't wait to find out -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Dave was working at home when John Durban called mid-morning to say the drone photogrammetry team had found southern residents heading our way off Blunden Island in Boundary Pass. Dave and his sister Sally grabbed their stuff and met Erin down at Snug Harbor. Ken had also got the whale report and he and Gail got off the dock and on scene with the whales first in "Shachi". "Orcinus" left a little while later and got on scene a<b> mile or so southwest of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island at about 1100</b>. The first whales the crew in "Orcinus" saw were the <b>J19s, L77s, J39, and L85</b>. These whales were loosely spread in small groups and singles and were traveling south at a high rate of speed....Full encounter report &amp; photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 74.

<b>J16 and J50 - Georgia Strait</b> - One for the memory bank... watching the socializing and logging was the best part. Shut down in the middle of [Georgia] Strait with smokey skies made for quite the scene. Tons of vocals and lots of surface active behaviour. Missed this amazing culture of killer whales....welcome home. -Photo by Gary Sutton, September 5

September 5 - <b>Admiralty Inlet &amp; Possession Sound - 8:03 p.m -</b> At one point they started going off like popcorn with three different animals breaching and a boat came charging at them which settled them right down. I was so mad. Can't make out the registration of the boat.
<br/><b>7:02 p.m. -</b> Just when I thought they resumed travel they stopped again. Tail slaps, headstands, breaches and spyhops. Can still hear blows from <b>north of Glendale</b> but heading towards mid channel and northerly. A female does a headstand during a predation event near Glendale Boat Launch about 7:00 PM. I saw more headstands in this one encounter than all other orca encounters combined. -Debbie Stewart

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Still after it got dark it was so calm you could hear every breath and breach. A very surreal experience.
<br/><b>8:01 p.m. -</b> They just <b>crossed the ferry lines heading nort</b>h still. Lots of surface activity still. Mid channel.
<br/><b>7:33 p.m. - Seeing them now from Clinton</b>. Still heading north. Still close to shore on whidbey. Also still a lot of surface activity. Lots of tail slaps.
<br/><b>6:47 p.m. - past Glendale still super close to shore Whidbey</b>. Combo milling and travel in two tight groups. Maybe taking some dinner along?
<br/><b>6:40 p.m. - super close to shore now</b>! I've never seen so many headstands!
<br/><b>6:34 p.m. - We were just down at Possession Park</b> for an amazing display. So calm. You could hear every breath and tail slap. They continued north. I'm up at the Clinton ferry terminal now. <b>T137A in Possession Sound off southeast Whidbey Island.</b> -Danielle Pennington

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:45 p.m. -</b> After lots of socializing they all turned north, harassed a sea lion on the <b>Possession Point </b>buoy but then moved on. Looks like they're all <b>heading up Possession Sound close to the Whidbey Island shore</b>! -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:40 p.m. -</b> they slowly moved north and are right<b> off the green buoy at Possession Point</b>. Saw some breaches...but still visibility terrible at this distance. 
<br/><b>5:15 p.m. -</b> After stalling out for a bit Bart reports they are now trending northbound towards Possession Point. I'm in North Edmonds now and even with binocs visibility is very limited due to wildfire smoke. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:23 a.m. -</b> amazing hunting action at <b>Possession Point</b> multiple kills. Hunting common murres! <b>T137A</b> breaches 5-6 times. Now they are slowly southbound again from Possession. 
<br/>3<b>:50 p.m. - many of them flipped north toward Cultus Bay</b>. On the chase!
<br/><b>3:45 p.m.- Ts very spread out south east of Possession mid channel</b>. Mostly southbound but one pod heading east at the moment.
<br/><b>3:00 the Ts are just outside of Useless Bay</b> aiming toward Possession Point. -Bart Rulon

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:30 - 1:50 p.m. - Ts</b> meander south slowly passing a tug boat, down the middle of <b>Admiralty Inlet, from the bluff south of Bush Point</b>, looking across Admiralty toward Hood Canal. -Photo by Howard Garrett, Orca Network, September 5, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:21 p.m. -</b> They are moving south at a good clip. <b>Almost at Bush Point </b>now.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:06 p.m. -</b> Half way <b>between Lagoon and Bush pnts</b>, mid channel still southbound tightly grouped. -Bart Rulon

Unidentified killer whales -<b> Orcas spotted Kayak Point</b> today! Wasn't fast enough/close enough to get pictures but they were there! Hard to tell how many, we saw 3...could have been more. Yes, <b>Port Susan</b> at Kayak Point. We were beachcombing on a field trip. We had been on beach for hours. Can't be exactly certain of the time, I would guess somewhere <b>between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM</b>. -Julie Urie

September 5 - Juan de Fuca - We Love Sooke for the diversity of marine wildlife and anticipation of what we will experience every day! <b>Humpback whales were encountered all around the Juan De Fuca Strait.

September 5 - South Puget Sound - <b>4:52 p.m.</b> - looks like he is headed <b>towards Colvos Passage</b> now.
<br/><b>4:35 p.m. - He's closer to the Tahlequah ferry dock</b> now. Very active.
<br/><b>4:15 p.m. - </b>Lots of tail slapping
<br/><b>4:10 p.m. - </b>Just saw him <b>between Tahlequah and Ruston</b>! Cruising towards Ruston. -Lori Patch

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:55 p.m. -</b> Still there, just <b>west of Owens beach</b>. Just surfaced closer to Tacoma eastbound.
<br/><b>5:37 p.m. - </b>He's making his way westbound again <b>between Anthony's and Owens beach</b>.
<br/><b>5:15 p.m. -</b> He's now eastbound mid channel at the <b>Point Defiance/Talequah ferry lane</b>.
<br/><b>5:00 p.m. -</b> Activity patterns suggest this is the same whale from the last several days. The tendency is that he is pretty slow moving and under for long stretches on deep dives, then has 2-3 30 minute periods per day of wild vocalization and pectoral slapping (usually when surrounded by way too many boats way too close). My house is one of the cottages that sits out over the water, (the last one with the Oregon Duck flag). I heard him overnight a bit and saw him all weekend. I'm a little worried about this guy. He's still out just northeast of Owens beach, just saw him surface 5:00.
<br/><b>3:41 p.m. - He's still out there in front of Owens beach</b>...deep dives and not a lot of action, but still meandering (no real direction).  Seen from my deck at Point Dalco. -Sarah Bradford Honeywell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:42 p.m. -</b> visible hump then fluke seen from the port side of the WSF Sealth <b>en route to Tahlequah nearer Vashon</b> on a sightline to Point Defiance (not Ruston). -Andrew Casad

September 5 - North Puget Sound -<b> 7:45 pm. Humpback at Point No Point </b>close to shore waiting for a moonrise and now a pleasant surprise! -Elyse Sollitto

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:06 p.m. -</b> Just crossed the ferry lane might be headed more <b>southwest now towards Kingston</b>.
<br/><b>4:59 p.m. - Humpback Edmonds Ferry Terminal</b>. Headed south. Appears to be alone, may be a different humpback than the one reported earlier this morning. -Courtney Burrell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:00 p.m. - Watched 2 humpbacks milling about just south of Whidbey island </b>east of the northbound shipping lane right about 1.00pm. They turned and headed North, up Admiralty Inlet. -Shannan Epps

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:55 a.m. -</b> It is glassy calm out here, I've not seen the humpbacks. <b>Whales headed NWerly directionally towards Admiralty</b> well over 30 minutes ago according to a woman I spoke with in Edmonds.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:13 a.m. -</b> Now with them on Chillkat Express, <b>Edmonds ferry terminal</b> north maybe 3/4 mile offshore. -Trevor Tillman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:00 a.m. -</b> WS Ferries reports a <b>humpback in the Kingston-Edmonds ferry lane</b>. No direction given. 
<br/><b>8:03 a.m. -</b> Trevor Tillman reports seeing <b>2 humpbacks heading northeast along the Edmonds/Kingston</b> ferry route. Approx 2 miles off Kingston.

September 5 - Juan de Fuca - Email received <b>8:53 a.m.</b> - And, a <b>resident Gray is</b> still poking around <b>Bullman Beach</b> this morning.  Not so close as before/tide is very low, but still around. -Scott Hartman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

September 5 - <b>11:33 a.m. -</b> Sounds like there are two. We just got back home to<b> Manzanita beach</b> and heard there was a whale that came up into <b>Quartermaster Harbor</b>. In harbor now going towards Burton. That must have been the one that surfaced next to our canoe at Point Piner. -K Rachel Keil
<br/>(<i>possible 2nd whale is <b>gray whale</b> - see Ehret report below</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:09 a.m. - </b>(reported as humpback) just passed us on <b>SE Maury (Sandy Shores area)</b>, in very shallow water, quickly heading south close to shore. After some discussion: ...given the speed it was traveling and the very shallow water it was in. I thought it was a humpback based on the fin that surfaced the two times I saw it rise and blow. But gray makes more sense. I've gone out and polled my neighbors who also saw the whale as it passed. They all agree that it wasn't a true fin, and was more of a ridge. -Jon Ehret

September 5 - Puget Sound - We encountered a transient superpod off <b>Possession Point</b> on our afternoon trip for Chilkat Express.  They were very spread out in the beginning, but it didn't take long before things got really exciting. The <b>T137s, T99s, T36Bs, T36, and T37A1</b> were aiming <b>southward toward Kingston and Edmonds</b> when all of a sudden they turned around and started porpoising (speed swimming) <b>toward Possession Point</b>! The chase was on! As we kept our eyes on<b> 4 of them racing north</b> another few whales, to the east of us, busted into a bait ball! 75 -100 gulls all shot into flight at the same time to avoid them. Chases were going on in all directions, and <b>T137A</b>, a big 15 year old male who was the farthest away and swimming by himself at the time, burst out of the air 5 times in a row, for some very impressive breaches!! It took us a while to realize that these killer whales were <b>hunting common murres</b>. The murres were scurrying around at the surface trying to get away, and the transients were exploding out of the water attempting to catch them, or slapping them with their tail flukes to stun them! It was a truly remarkable experience! No common murre within 400 hundred yards was safe. The anxious birds were frequently plunging their heads into the water over and over to try to spot any black and white torpedoes shooting toward them! Most of the adult common murres can't fly right now because they molt their flight feathers after nesting, which leaves them flightless for 1-2 months! It makes them much easier targets! -Bart Rulon,  Puget Sound Express naturalist

Morning Trip: September 5 2017 - a very memorable day for our passengers with Puget Sound Express! A transient superpod swam <b>into Puget Sound from Admiralty Inlet</b>! The pods included the <b>T137s, T36Bs, T99s, T36, and T37A1</b>! They were grouped up together very tightly, as if they were sleeping, to start things off. After about 20 minutes we noticed a nuclear submarine coming in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, with its various escorts. As the submarine approached the killer whales from behind the animals woke up and started getting very active. We witnessed several breaches and tailslaps from the killer whales as the submarine approached and passed by. One of the frequent breachers was T37A1, who is a 10 year old killer whale that does not travel with its birth pod anymore. This is a rarity among killer whales! -Puget Sound Express naturalist, Bart Rulon

Taken from <b>Lime Kiln, west side San Juan Island. Lots of whales</b> back and forth for hours. Night came, and there was the orange moon. It was dead quiet and calm, the only sounds to fill the air were crickets and the blows of several orca. They didn't come super close to shore but it was amazing to spend hours in their presence. And did I mention an incredible sunset too? So glad to have the residents back, hope they stay! -Photo by Rachel Haight, September 4

They're back! See Center for Whale Research Encounter #73 Sept 4 for full report and photos: For several weeks there have been reports of whales coming in off Jordan River in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and whale watch boats have been dutifully going west from Victoria to hopefully encounter incoming residents. But, each time it has turned out that the whales that are found are Bigg's Transient killer whales, and we now have a record number of sightings and encounters of this ecotype in Salish Sea waters. Today, however, Mark Malleson was able to confirm that <b>incoming whales he encountered west of Sheringham lighthouse at 1030 AM were RESIDENTS!!</b> We decided to launch in two waves, with "Shachi" leaving Snug Harbor at 1128 as the whales were reported to be nearing Otter Point, and "Orcinus" departing a couple of hours later if the whales came in as far as Victoria. "Shachi" encountered the lead group of whales at 1310 just east of Secretary Island, and the first whale identified was J19, who seems to have taken over as leader after the passing of J2 in the winter of 2015/16.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Today we welcomed back our Southern Residents after an extended absence from the Salish Sea. Wherever they were I hope they were finding enough to eat and I'm so happy to see them. Here is a spyhop from <b>Slick (J16) alongside her daughter, Scarlet (J50)</b>. Sunset was stunning, and better yet it was spent in the company of <b>members of J, K, and L pods. Here's Matia (L77)</b> and a friend under a swiftly setting sun. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, September 4

Tim and I went out on our own boat today and got word as we were leaving the dock that there was a breaching <b>humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" at Apple Tree Cove</b> near Kingston! We joined Chilkat and watched Two Spot surface and dive a few times. Eventually Chilkat and all the other boats around left, as they were leaving Two Spot surfaced right in front of our idle boat!! She then circled us slowly, checking us out, she stayed right under the surface and kept circling, then she went under the boat and came up next to us again! Then she fluked...-Janine  Harles

<b>6:47 p.m. - Pod of 5 or 6</b> just rounded West point headed towards <b>Golden Gardens</b>. They hung around the Fort Lawton side for about 20 minutes, lots of milling, diving, tales flying every which way, quick course changes and even had a seal try to escape unsuccessfully under my boat. I took about 400 photos from todays orcas from the West Point beach area to Golden Gardens before they headed towards mid channel and off into the sunset North Bound. A shot of the youngest breaching one of three times while I was shooting. Off Golden Gardens north bound at a good pace. Lots of breaching..made a kill off the channel to the locks and celebrated then took off. What an experience when the male surfaced 20 ft from us....This shot is just off the Shilshole Breakwater, ...what ended up as about three kills, lots of milling, diving, quick course changes and even a seal trying to hide under my boat causing the big male to charge towards us out of nowhere. -Gary Peterson

<b>6:45 p.m. - </b>I arrived at a very busy<b> West Point lighthouse, Discovery Park in time to see at least 4</b> just south of the point. Female and calf in lead...male and juvenile trailing. They rounded West Point lighthouse close to shore. I ran to the north side to catch a glimpse of the male directly out from me descend quite vigoroulsy underwater as if to catch up. All eastbound headed towards Shilshole. Such a Long dive, I think they changed course underwater and surfaced more directionally to the north than they were heading when they went down. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

San Juans - There were <b>transient killer whales in a dozen different locations around the Salish Sea today, totaling more than 60 whales.</b> I was lucky enough to see the T<b>65As and T100s</b> this afternoon in northern Haro Strait, and then the T36Bs and T99s this evening. Here's a shot from tonight near sunset as the <b>36Bs and 99s</b> rounded the point at the Cattle Point Lighthouse to head up San Juan Channel at dusk. The "back side" (aka north side) of <b>Spieden Island</b> is always a perfect setting for those backlit blows. This shot is from  September 2nd, when we were there with the <b>T65As</b>. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, September 2, 2017 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Hi ON, we saw <b>T65As and T100s around 15:00 9/2 near Spieden Island</b>. The groups split with T65As heading east and T100s I believe going north. Observed T65As circle Gull Rock 3x, then passed Flattop Rock &amp; kept heading east. Appeared to be possible foraging activity but not confirmed. We left <b>T65As around 17:00</b>. 
<br/>Earlier 9/2 around <b>13:00 in Moresby passage </b>(Canada) we saw <b>T36As</b> actively hunt a harbor porpoise. Sorry porpoise, but it was spectacular! I didn't personally ID - going on what nearby WW naturalists said. There was some confusion about who was who b/t the 100s &amp; 65As... but you're right, it was a wonder day with Ts. The earlier group in Canada was especially active- tons of leaps, tail-slaps, spy hops, etc. ( Ok, confirmed it was the T36As in the 13:00 Moresby group - though we saw 5 animals, not 4. Suspect T37A might have been traveling with the T36As as the transient guide says she will sometimes do - her fin seems to match what I saw but not sure). -Michelle Leann

September 2 - Admiralty Inlet - Yet another beautiful day with orcas reported in 3 different directions - hmmm - Capt. Eric chose <b>Admiralty Inlet </b>(west side of Whidbey Isl.) and we found the <b>T046Bs</b> who were maneuvering through the really strong riptide currents at the <b>north end of Marrowstone Island</b>. The tides pushed us in many directions, and it was exciting to watch the whales also maneuver these strong currents. We had good looks at the T046Bs, before heading homeward passing Partridge buoy with Sea Lions, and Minor Island with many harbor seals. Another outstanding trip aboard the Mystic Sea! <b>2:00 p.m. - 7 or more Transients in Admiralty passing Fort Flagler</b> (north end Marrowstone Island) northbound. Tentatively ID'd as T46Bs (&amp; possibly some T37s) -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

September 1 - <b>5:30 p.m. -</b> Twice I saw a (grey) whale arch up showing her dorsal. I was at<b> Rocky Point, Whidbey Island</b>.  It had slanted dorsal, not like an orca but smaller. Wow I've never seen a humpback like this before. She seemed to be feeding, following krill or these shiny schools of silver fish. And a sea lion bopping up his head from time to time. What a beautiful place to enjoy such nature. -Diane Jandreau
<br/>(<i>reported as gray but w/dorsal <b>sounds like humpback</b> - ALB</i>)
