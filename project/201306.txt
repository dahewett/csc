<b>June 30</b>
<br/><br/>
I was boating <b>between Seattle and Bainbridge Island</b> around<b> 5:pm</b> and came across <b>a group of orcas</b> heading north.
<br/>David Bernstein
<br/>*<br/>
I saw <b>2 Orca, one male, heading out of Admiralty Inlet</b> past Point Wilson at about<b> 4 pm </b>this afternoon. Moving fast. 
<br/>Kippi Waters
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:50 -</b> Have heard a second hand report of someone crossing on the <b>Edmonds ferry seeing a small pod of 4-6 orca</b> headed north, closer to the Kingston side.....anyone else seen or heard anything?
<br/>Pam Ren
<br/>*<br/>
Beautiful day for kayaking! AND whale sightings! We launched off <b>Possession Point about 11am</b>, and as we were rowing along the homes to the south, several people told us that they had just seen <b>Orcas </b>going by.  Sure enough, as we rounded the furthest point, we saw several!!  They were too distant to id them, but close enough to really enjoy! They turned west and then disappeared. What a treat!!  The one funny thing we noticed were an usually high number of seals that had swam into the shallows! It was probably a good idea, unless they wanted to become lunch!
<br/>Jerry and Kathy Hitzemann
<br/>*<br/> 
So much life out there today! We had an incredible encounter with about <b>4 Minke Whales at Eastern Bank</b> this <b>afternoon</b>. At one point there were three large bait balls all around us with 2 Minke Whales lunging through them!

<br/><br/>
Since I know she's got some fans out there...here's a shot of <b>L25 Ocean Sun</b> from last Saturday, taken from shore on the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. She was in with an interesting mix of L-Pod whales: <b>L41 Mega, L95 Nigel, L82 Kasatka, and L116 Finn</b>.

<br/>Chris Teren
<br/>*<br/> 
At <b>San Juan County Park with L-pod around 11:30am</b>.
<br/>Nishan DeSilva
<br/>*<br/>
Lots of calisthenics from our <b>orca friends</b> this morning, as pods went west to east, and not long after, east to west, very close to shore passing <b>Eagle Point</b>. They had some competition for their salmon however!
<br/>Alex Shapiro 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:08 am -</b> Large group of [<b>orcas] approaching Eagle Cove, San Juan Island</b>, close to shore, heading north, breaching and spy hopping!
<br/>Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Large orca pod 8 pm off Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island heading south toward Seattle on a bullet.
<br/>David Smukowski
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Three orca spotted 13.5 miles west of Westport, WA</b>. Assume T's - what a surprise. Hopefully ID's in a day or two.

<br/><br/>
We were coming back from a <b>humpback whale </b>near <b>Race Rocks </b>and came across the <b>L054s: L054, L108, L100</b>.
Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10 pm -</b> Wonderful night watching <b>Orcas coming north in Haro Strait</b>, breaching, and tail slapping south of Lime Kiln State Park. So happy to see them having fun. Having a great time on San Juan Island.
<br/>Marcia Kalchik Lewandowski
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:46 - L Pod Inbound!</b>
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:43 - With L pod! near Sooke</b>, British Columbia. 
<br/>James Mead Maya
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11 am -</b> After leaving the area on 6/23/13, <b>L pod is heading for San Juan Island</b> right now!!!

<b>June 27</b>
<br/><br/>
What a bonus! <b>A humpback whale (BCY324) near Bird Rocks</b>, only 30 minutes from leaving Anacortes on "Mystic Sea." Passengers enjoyed hearing the powerful blows and seeing the flick of those magnificent tail flukes before they disappeared into the depths as the whale headed around the <b>south end of Lopez</b>. Just one thing missing - the memory card from my camera.
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Naturalist on "Mystic Sea"
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw <b>humpback whale at 7:15 pm</b> near entrance to <b>Snug Harbor</b>. Watched it for several minutes until it dove!
<br/>Rebecca Spurgeon
<br/>*<br/>
Received at<b> 1:30 pm</b>: Tammy Fisher called to relay a report of <b>6 orcas, including 1 male, just north of Depoe Bay, OR </b>heading north. Someone also saw <b>a Gray whale spout</b> and thought the orcas were following the Grays. 
<br/><br/>
<b>June 26</b>
<br/><br/>
A <b>humpback was at San Juan Island National Historical Park</b>.
<br/>Justin Time Davis
<br/>*<br/>
So cool. We went out to <b>Constance Bank</b> and saw a humpback feeding, and then on the way back home Ivan Reiff had another <b>humpback</b>. Same one we had last month, and the same from Saturday. He/she was very active when he hit the currents, with lots of fluking and then he began to roll in the kelp and slapping his pecs with streaming kelp! Awesome!
<br/>John Boyd 
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>humpback </b>was on <b>Constance Bank, SE of Victoria</b> in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/>
Received this morning at 4 something am: Ken, on the Pilot boat Chehalis, reporting <b>3 - 4 orcas near buoy 13 near Westport/Grays Harbor, WA</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>June 25</b>
<br/><br/>
The Minke Whales were fantastic today! On our 12 Noon Western Explorer trip we found <b>4 at Eastern Bank and then 3 at Hein Bank</b>. We heard reports from other boats of at least 4 more in the general area too! On the way in we spent some time with our Harbor Seal friends and found a mating pair of Bald Eagles. Beautiful day!

<br/><br/>
From KitsapSun @ 5:23 pm: Someone just called our office to report seeing a<b> whale in the Manette area</b>, northwest of Bremerton. She couldn't identify what kind. Anybody else seeing this?
<br/>Susan Marie Andersson
<br/><i>This is probably the gray whale that's been seen in Puget Sound recently</i>.
<br/><br/>
<b>June 23</b>
<br/><br/>
Mike Lorden was waiting for the moon to set at <b>Ebey's Landing on Whidbey Island</b> in the wee hours of the morning <b>before 3 am</b> and saw and heard <b>at least 2 orcas </b>blowing and breaching. Too dark for photos obviously. 
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:38 pm - The gray whale at Elger Bay </b> (Camano Island) was here only 15 minutes at the high tide of the day. It seemed to feed 5-6 times and swam around the rest. It didn't feed like the other whales that visit here. There is lots of sand shrimp, but it was in and out, and did not try the most common and best spots. It surfaces about 10' off shore (no other whale has done that) and at one point was swimming directly at shore fast when it was only 100' out. Most other whales swim parallel. I felt like it was frantic, semi-feeding activity, and certainly not efficient. Definitely a smaller whale maybe 20-25 feet.

<br/><br/>
I wanted to report a sighting of a <b>[gray] whale</b>. We saw it in <b>Little Skookum Inlet </b>on Saturday. It's a very small shallow inlet so we were worried about it stranding itself, although I haven't heard reports of a stranding yet. Also in 2006 there was a minke that stranded itself right near where we saw it.
<br/>Marshal Hoy
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>humpback </b>was just here off the south/west entrance to<b> Active Pass</b>, Galiano Island about <b>8:30 pm</b>.
<br/>Janusz Kowalski
<br/>*<br/>
WA State Ferries relayed a report from the Captain of the ferry Sealth, of <b>a humpback whale in San Juan Channel at 12:30 pm</b>, just NE of Cape Caution, northbound.
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>humpback </b>was just here off the south/west entrance to <b>Active Pass</b>, Galiano Island an hour ago (about <b>8:30 pm</b>).
<br/>Janusz Kowalski
<br/>*<br/>
What a cool day on the water! We were watching <b>L77 and L119</b> aboard The Odyssey of San Juan Excursions today when suddenly, this <b>minke whale </b>appeared alongside them! <b>L77, L119, and the minke all surfaced together</b> several times alongside the vessel. The same minke was later that day seen swimming with L41. Absolutely incredible.
<br/>Brittany Bowles, naturalist for San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Grey Whale in Nisqually.</b>
<br/>Nisqually Reach Nature Center
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>a small gray whale</b> while boating near fish trap/<b>Johnson point</b> (south Puget Sound) around <b>3pm</b>. 
<br/>Janet Singler
<br/>*<br/>
From <b>8:37 am</b> reporting what sounds like the little <b>Gray whale in Little Skookum Inlet</b> about 1 mile from the head of the inlet, headed out of the inlet.
<br/>Steve Ness 
<br/>*<br/>

<b>12:02 - Orcas heading North past False Bay</b>.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L22 Spirit &amp; her sons L79 Skana &amp; L89 Solstice</b> reached the south end of <b>Lime Kiln</b> just shortly before the start of Orca Sing. Skana must have turned back south as Spirit &amp; Solstice rode the tide to the lighthouse, surfacing back and forth in the calm sea, as friends visited and the music played on. Perfect beauty. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
There was <b>a Humpback in Bedwell sound @ 14:30</b>, <b>L's around salmon bank all day</b>, with a <b>minke </b>or two!
<br/>Mowgli Lupus
<br/>*<br/>
We had a very interesting day of sightings today. The Western Prince II found <b>a Humpback Whale in San Juan Channel at about 10:45 AM</b>. In the afternoon we encountered <b>4-6 Minke Whales</b> lunge feeding near <b>Salmon Bank</b>. Later, with the <b>L12s </b>we had a <b>Minke Whale</b> swimming with <b>L41 </b>for about 20 minutes.
<br/>Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching &amp; Wildlife Tours
<br/>*<br/> 
From <b>8:30-9:00 PM</b> I watched part of the <b>L12 </b>sub-group of <b>L-Pod </b>head south from <b>American Camp on San Juan Island</b>. They were quite a ways offshore, but it was a beautiful sight in the sunset with flat-calm waters and the Olympic Mountains in the background. The sounds of the blows really carried. The only whale I could ID for sure was <b>L85</b>, but my guess was all but the L22s were there.
<br/>Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L22's </b>today along <b>San Juan Island</b>. It was great to watch <b>L22 cruise along with her sons L79 and L89</b>. Then on the way home, we ran into<b> a Humpback at Monarch Head</b> along Saturna Island! Beautiful flat calm seas all day long....life is good!

<br/><br/>
I was sitting on the patio around <b>7:30 a.m.</b> and heard a whale breath. I looked out to see a small whale, <b>could be the gray</b> spotted the other day. I am not sure what kind it was. It was in <b>Eld Inlet South of Flap Jack Point</b>, swimming north. It hung out in the area between Flap Jack and Green Cove for a few minutes and then I lost sight of it.

<br/>*<br/>
I received a report from Gotcha Fishing Charters that a group of<b> T's</b> were east bound at <b>6:30 am</b> near <b>Secretary Island, East Sooke Park</b> in the morning. We found the <b>T069A's and T069D at 10:30</b> east bound at Albert Head. They then turned around and backtracked out west along the shoreline of Vancouver Island.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
<br/>*<br/>  
Whales everywhere! We had some early morning reports of <b>whales near Albert head and whales off Eagle point</b> so we started to head down that way. En route, we bumped into the<b> T65A's with T75C in Active Pass</b>! They headed north into the Strait of Georgia and then started to go west up Galiano Island. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:04 pm - L pod calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone!</b>
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:50 - I can see Mega L41, Mystery L85</b>, and the rest of the <b>L12s </b>heading North from <b>False Bay</b>.

Recent sightings of <b>orca on the Oregon coast</b> from a halibut fishing trip (6/20/13). Courtesy of Naked Whale Research.
<br/>Greetings on this Full Moon weekend! Our friends from 5Star in Gold Beach, Oregon called in a belated killer whale sighting from their halibut fishing trip. The details from their encounter is as follows:  
<br/>Time: <b>1200PM </b>
<br/>Location: <b>4nm W Gold Beach, OR</b>
<br/>Number of Animals:<b> 6-8, females with at least two calves</b>
<br/>Behavior/Direction: non-directional milling with percussive surface behavior.
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>T65As </b>were in <b>Fulford Harbor (Salt Spring Island)</b> today, a long trip but well worth it, and we didn't even notice the rain!
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Five orca</b> were in <b>Fulford Harbour, Salt Spring Island</b> for approximately one hour today. At <b>3:30 PM </b>tThey were swimming southward toward Isabella Point. The group seemed to consist of females and juveniles. I assume that they were transients. Even though they were followed by about ten whale watching boats, they appeared to be in a relaxed swimming mode.
<br/>Susan Thorpe MacLeod
<br/>*<br/>
<b>07:30 - about 20 KW off the Ucluelet</b> ocean front heading W. right now off Long Beach Rocks still &gt;W some open saddles. Last seen <b>13:40</b>, .5nm off Cox Pt. still &gt;W.

KOMO news: <b>Gray whale spotted in backwater of south Puget Sound</b>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10 am - </b>A friend has sighted<b> a small whale near the Purdy Bridge</b> (Gig Harbor area).
<br/>Clare Honn
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10 am -</b> there is <b>a baby gray whale near the Purdy Bridge</b>. I got the news off your facebook page, and I've been watching a live feed from Kiro 7. The whale does not look healthy. It is very weakly swimming back and forth, and was stuck on a sand bar for a while. Hopefully there is something someone can do for this little whale. 
<br/>Sara Troyer
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:14am - The Gray whale</b> that was seen in Allyn bay the other day is at the <b>Purdy spit</b> right now. 
<br/>Ti Zurfluh
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:48pm - The<b> Gray whale</b> is at the Purdy Spit</b> today. 
<br/>Andrea Talmadge
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>Purdy Bridge whale</b> waved goodbye w/a giant pectoral fin, moved out into deeper water, and is no longer visible.

Sweet little <b>gray whale</b> in <b>south Puget Sound</b>, among other big concerns, appears to have a sizable chunk out of her/his pec fin. Holding little one in my heart.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
At<b> 09:17</b> we spotted a minimum of <b>three killer whales</b> approximately three miles offshore of Wedding Rock, Patrick's Point State Park, <b>Trinidad, CA</b>. The individuals were either immature males and/or females. I am a graduate student at Humboldt State University studying gray whales. I was conducting shore surveys with an intern. Because they were far out it was hard to track and see what they were doing but within our hour of surveying we saw multiple surfacings. From our position they moved from compass bearing 265 to 280 throughout the survey. Hope this is helpful.

Working in my boathouse at <b>Olympia Yacht Club last evening (6pm)</b> and heard the familiar "woosh" of air as a whale was taking a breath approx 20 feet from the open curtain. Did see a bit of a brown gray back as it dove with what appeared to be spinal cord type of bumps or surface bumps at the peak. Saw another gentleman on my walk to get a better view and he then saw the whale thru an open boathouse to the west of the yacht club moving north. We both walked to the northern most floats and saw the whale again surfacing (heading north about 200 ft away) and the tail appeared to be in the 5-10' in width at the flukes. Last sighting but others at the club had heard there was a whale in the neighborhood. I have seen a whales in this most southern part of Puget Sound and have experience with them in inland waters between here and Alaska, the open ocean and several parts of Baja California, Mexico.

<b>12:25 -</b> wow, ship noise is loud, but can still hear them on <b>Lime Kiln</b> as well.
<br/>Susan Marie Andersson 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:02pm - Hearing them on the Lime Kiln</b> now.
<br/>Sara Troyer
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:31am - Hearing calls</b> amid the ship noise on <b>Orca Sound</b> hydro's now...

<b>4:38pm - </b>MV Sea Hawk and Center for Whale Research are with a small pod of <b>Transients </b>just passing <b>Eagle Point </b>heading up island. Approximately five in the pod including a big male and a calf. The Transients are IDed as the<b> T036s</b>, including little <b>T036A2</b>, born in 2012. Also in the group were <b>T075 and her offspring T075A</b>, a male born in 1991. T075A was tagged in Southeast Alaska in 2011 and hasn't been encountered in these waters in seven years!
<br/>San Juan Outfitters
<br/>*<br/> 
We had an amazing encounter with the <b>T65As and T75Bs</b> just north of Parks Bay. They spent over 30 minutes trying to get these seals. The seals survived this encounter.
<br/>Ivan Reiff
<br/>*<br/> 
We had the <b>T065A's with T075B, 075B1, and T075C</b> in the <b>morning</b>. They were north west bound north of <b>Pt. Wilson</b>. In the <b>afternoon </b>the rest of the <b>T075's  (T075 and T075A)</b> along with the<b> T036A's</b> were found making a kill near Whale Rocks. They continued north west inside Salmon Bank towards Eagle Point while the <b>T065A's and T075B group went north up San Juan Channel</b>.

Spent time with <b>L25, Ocean Sun and L41, Mega, off Victoria</b>. They were quickly heading out and towards <b>Race Rocks</b>. The two made time however, to goof off, with Ocean Sun seemingly chasing a fish out from under the boat and over towards Mega where the two of them thrashed as they took it down.

I can't say anything but WOW about todays trip! We left <b>Vancouver </b>and within 20 minutes, we found the<b> T86A's and the T101's </b>around <b>Point Grey (UBC)</b> heading straight for downtown Vancouver. I didn't think they would go all the way but they proved me wrong! They went all the way <b>into Coal Harbour</b> right in the heart of downtown!!! Pedestrians gathered all over the seawall at Stanley Park as the whales swam by. The T101's made a pit stop under the lions gate bridge to make a quick kill and then continued on their way.

We had word of 'about <b>10' orcas near Porlier Pass</b> (Gulf Islands) just before we left the dock. We scurried over and soon found a cavalcade of whales, about <b>20 in all</b>. These included <b>T65As, T124As, T20/T21 and T86As</b>. It was a drizzly day and they weren't doing much more than just a fairly swift travel north, but the weather and the amount of whales made it a spectacular sight.

 I called a few days ago about the possible <b>orca sighting in Port Orford, OR</b>. We were standing on the port dock around <b>8:30 pm</b> on Monday, June 10, and saw what looked to be an orca. The markings on the whale were very similar to those on the flyer from which I got your number - black upper body with white sides/belly. As you can see from the attached photo, the fin is also similar to that described on the flyer. We tried to get a better shot of it, but were unable to. The whale came to the surface several times while we were on the dock - it looked to be heading out of the port and back towards the sea. It was a pretty amazing sight. (We are from Detroit, so not many whale sitings there, I'm afraid!)

This afternoon from <b>3:45-4:15 PM</b> I watched<b> L-Pod </b>head south against a strong flood tide from <b>Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island</b>. The numbers seemed right for all the L-Pod whales that have been around the last few days, though it was hard to get too many IDs as they were backlit in choppy water. I definitely saw the<b> L22s, L92, and L95</b>. No L11s as far as I could tell. Word was J-Pod was heading north towards Turn Point at the same time.

This evening from <b>7:00-7:45 PM</b> we watched a group of <b>L-Pod whales</b> head south past <b>Lime Kiln Point State Park</b>. They were mostly in travel mode, but the L55s stopped to forage for a few minutes and at one point launched a salmon into the air! Those of us that stayed to watch the sunset were surprised at 8:50 PM when L22 and her two sons L79 and L89 came by close to the rocks heading north at a good clip. They, along with the rest of the L12 subgroup, had been off the south end of the island, but it was only those three that came north. Perhaps they were going to meet up with J-Pod, as they were still to the north?

They were nice and close for us today! We found them right at <b>Sand Heads</b> (a few miles west from the mouth of the Fraser River) heading south and they were VERY spread. I saw <b>mostly L's (L95, L92, L55, L103, L53, L72, L82 and L105)</b> but there were J's in the mix too (we only ID'd J27 and J34). It was such a gorgeous day on the water.

Another shot from this afternoon's encounter with the <b>orcas</b>. This is my absolute favorite whale, <b>L87 Onyx</b>. You can see he is swimming through a kelp bed and is absolutely covered with the stuff. Orcas have very sensitive skin and they do enjoy touching each other or swimming through kelp beds. Perhaps they do it to scratch an itch or perhaps they just like the way it feels - a bit like a day at the spa complete with a seaweed wrap.

It was another incredible day on the <b>west side of San Juan Island. From 4:00-5:30 PM J-Pod and most if not all of L-Pod</b> slowly made their way north past Land Bank's Westside Preserve. They were in tight, slow moving groups with no apparent hurry to go anywhere, as they went back and forth several times before finally meandering north. It's always fun to see how the whales mix and match with each other. A couple examples from today: <b>L41 was with J19 and J41, and J27 was in hot pursuit of L53</b>. It's shaping up to be an amazing season for shore-based whale-watching here!

Saw <b>J Pod and many members of L Pod </b>together northwest of <b>San Juan Island</b>. An amazing show! See www.facebook.com/chasedekkerimages

What a way to kick off the new month! <b>L12's</b> return with <b>J pod</b> and there was a lot of excitement out there. We got to watch L41, L79 and L87 getting frisky with each other around <b>Battleship Island</b> (Haro Strait). Lots of action all over the place and to top it all off, we got to see "Big Momma" in the Strait of Georgia on the way home lunge feeding!
