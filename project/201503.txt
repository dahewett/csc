Orca watchers, here's your latest update on tagged orca L84. March 30--The previous update on 24 March found the whales northbound just south of Cape Blanco, Oregon. They continued north and by the 26th they were off Tillimook Bay in northern Oregon and by the 28th they were off Grays Harbor, Washington. There they turned south, and as of<b> this morning (30th) they were off the Columbia River</b>. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

<b>5:45pm - </b>My husband and I spotted <b>6 transient orcas off the Oregon Coast at Boiler Bay</b>. They were a half mile from shore.  We watched them for an hour and a half during that time we saw them attack and feast on two sea lions.  We are volunteers for the Whale Watching Spoken Here Program.  Today was the most spectacular whale watching we have ever encountered. The deliberate and calculated behavior of the orcas was phenomenal. In addition to attacking the sea lions we watched them breach, fluke slap, head lung and gracefully surface to breath. There was <b>1 calf among the 6 orcas</b> we saw this evening.  After we left Boiler Bay we went south to Depoe Bay to see if we could see them going by, we spotted them <b>just north of Depoe Bay</b> and watched them swim south and beyond the buoy markers at Depoe Bay.  We last saw them going south around <b>7:30 pm</b>.   I have included some photos in hopes that you will be able to identify some of them. Have a wonderful day! -Kent &amp; Edith Hitchings

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We left Langley marina and immediately a Bald Eagle scooped up his fish lunch, right in front of us, what a catch! We headed towards<b> Gedney/Hat Island</b> and found our first two whales, <b>#383 and #22 on the east side</b>, traveling close to shore. These two stayed together as we caught up with them later in the day, and <b>#22</b> gave us a nice close pass-by, what a thrill. Single spouts were seen further east towards Everett, and towards Camano Head, but those whales were on long dives, didn't see enough of their bodies for identification. The weather held, and the sun even came out - another great day aboard Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein (Volunteer Naturalist)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>16:50 </b>saw a spout (apparently a <b>gray whale</b>) heading east 1/4 from<b> Polnell Point</b>, heading towards Mariners Cove, just 200' or so off the beach. This is Saratoga Passage and is on the north end of Whidbey Island. -Steve Rothboeck

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:20 pm - From Baby Island Heights</b> area on Whidbey Island,  I see<b> 2 grays</b> and looks like to me near <b>Onamac Point on Camano Island</b>. -Marilyn Armbruster

I was blessed to see <b>two Orca</b> close to shore (20-40 feet away) at <b>East Sooke Park </b>(S. Vancouver Island, BC) this <b>morning</b>. I only got one decent picture as they went around a point. By the time I could get to the trail that ran along the shoreline, they were gone. I waited in the area for a couple of hours hoping they'd return but it didn't happen. A magical experience! -Karen Kehler

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:34pm - </b>They're heading past <b>Onamac on Camano</b> right now! -Desi Tracy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Yet another wonderful whale day starting at<b> 9:30 am</b> with <b>half-a-dozen gray whales</b> seen feeding close to<b> Langley shores</b>. Twenty minutes out of Langley 'Mystic Sea' spotted heart-shaped blows south of Sandy Point again close to shore, followed by sightings of<b> #49 Patch and #53 Little Patch</b> traveling side-by-side. Later pecs and tails (possibly #22) were seen close to shore in feeding mode on the Clinton side of the ferry lanes. Seems all whales today were having a gourmet lunch! -Sandra Pollard (Naturalist)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:35am -</b> Sandra Pollard aboard the Mystic Sea reports seeing <b>six gray whales off Langley</b> this morning, and Patch and Little Patch just north of the Clinton ferry dock.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:05am - </b> For the past 1/2 hour I have been watching <b>four Grays</b> (no ID) feeding below our bluff on <b>Whidbey Island</b>, Saratoga Passage, moving from <b>Langley Marina toward Sandy Point</b> (southbound-ALB). I haven't seen evidence of Gray's, on our beach, for two years. I can still hear their "blows" through my open window. Very exciting. -Noel Goforth, Langley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:48am - 3 grey whales</b> feeding in shallow, in the <b>Saratoga passage</b> just north of Langley, slowly making their way towards Langley! -Rachel Kellog Franklin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Thar she blows! Woke up this morning and said, "I think the whales will visit today." Walked outside with coffee in hand and within minutes heard the beautiful breath of <b>three gray whales</b>. Just passed by. At the <b>Inn at Langley</b> now. I may have gotten my first fluke shot in the passage. It's going to be a great day! -Debra Campbell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Pacific White-sided dolphin, March 24, 25 &amp; 26, Point Defiance and the Narrows</b>. First encounter was under sail, he joined us and and sailed all around with us for an hour following us. Then the next day he met us on the dingy going, we stopped ashore to drop off trash we collected then he joined us again when we left. He performed a few acrobatic jumps and spins. Then the 27th he showed up as we motored in the sail boat near the narrows. And we have more video from this day of him rubbing on the rudder. Very Odd. -Alan Niles

Magical encounter with <b>J-pod off Victoria</b>. -Val Shore

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were incredibly fortunate to have caught up with<b> J Pod</b> again just <b>south of Discovery Island</b>. The day was glassy calm and warm - very out of the ordinary for March, but we're not complaining! We were also able to spend some good quality time with <b>J2 Granny</b>... At an estimated 104 years of age, she was acting quite spunky and spending a lot of time rolling around with J38 Cookie (born in 2003). She appears vibrant, healthy, and not a wrinkle on her! Must be all those Omega-3's in that lovely salmon...this was my first really good look at DoubleStuf this spring and I am amazed by his size! DoubleStuf was born in 1998 which puts him at 17 years of age and he still has growing to do. Onyx was born in 1992 and is considered to be fully mature, but I think after watching them the other day, DoubleStuf may have already passed him in terms of size. I also noticed DoubleStuf's little brother, Cookie, seems to be noticeably sprouting his dorsal fin this year. At 12 years of age, Cookie is just beginning those awkward teenage years....-Katie Jones

Today I had a fantastic encounter with <b>J pod</b>, including both new calves - <b>J50 and J51</b>! The pod was in resting formation, but <b>L87 Onyx and J34 Doublestuf </b>were happily causing a ruckus on the side as the rest of the group 'slept'. We were with the group from Constance Bank, near Trial Island, to Race Rocks. -Marcie Callewaert

Received a call from commercial crab fisherman Guy Lee, reporting <b>a pod of orcas - 5 adults and 1 calf - about 7 - 10 miles from the harbor at Halfmoon Bay, CA</b>. The calf was breaching, and they all came close to the boat, and Guy said they saw chunks of what looked like sea lion or some kind of marine mammal meat/blubber floating in the water.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We just received a call from Meg at <b>3:50 pm</b>, reporting a pod of<b> ~4 orcas ~6 miles outside the harbor at Halfmoon Bay, CA</b>, today.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Gray whales off Gedney (Hat) Island, including #49 (Patch) and #723.</b> The whales were well into the shallows waving their pectoral fins as they dug deep for ghost-shrimp, attracting a dozen or so Pacific Harbor seals to the area and a group of Harbor porpoise. Passengers could not have wished for a better day with sunshine, snow-capped mountains and the best the Pacific Northwest has to offer. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist

What a day!! -Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:31pm -</b> Moments ago, a pod witnessed from our home above <b>Brighton beach</b> (just north of the Clinton ferry dock).

<b>5:00pm - Sighted 4 Orca whales in Discovery Bay</b> off of Beckett Point.  This is my <b>second sighting of these whales in the past 3 weeks</b>. Very unusual to see them in Gardiner.

While watching grays as a volunteer, "whale watch spoken here" I spotted <b>7 orcas about 1/2 mile from shore</b>. There were 2 males in the group and 1 calf with mom. At first they appeared to be tracking a grey and her calf, but then they were in an apparent feeding (maybe fish) we watched them from <b>12:00 noon to about 20 after</b>. They were moving north and then west out of our view. -Wayne Starr

Update on tagged orca <b>L84</b>...24 March update - On the previous post on 20 March, the whales were southbound about 20 km <b>north of Brookings, Oregon</b>, near the California border. Our colleague Jeff Jacobson, who is based in northern California, was able to intercept them on the water that afternoon and determine that some of L pod and and K pod were with L84. The whales continued south, reaching Cape Mendocino on the afternoon of 22 March and then turned and headed north, reaching the area near the <b>Rogue River at 1100</b> today. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

First <b>J pod</b> sighting of the year (for me anyway)! So excited to have caught up with these guys on the west side of the island yesterday, especially since my last encounter with them was in October. Since then there has been the heartbreaking loss of J32 Rhapsody and her unborn calf. However there have also been the exciting events of two new babies being born. We barely caught glimpses of the tiny ones yesterday, but we did get to see <b>J2 Granny, L87 Onyx, The Cookie Clan, and this fellow pictured below - J26 Mike</b>! I didn't fire off many shots from the camera yesterday because I was so excited, but hopefully there will be many more encounters with these guys in the coming weeks and photos and stories to share. Any day spent with orcas in the wild = a very good day. -Katie Jones

Got to spend some time with <b>J pod</b> (and Big Mama the humpback, see below)... J pod was in a active mood too as they inched their way up the <b>West side of San Juan Island</b> in some pretty nice social groups. There were lots of tail slaps from <b>Granny J2, Samish J14, Princess Angeline J17, Shachi J19, Doublestuf J34, Tahlequah J35, Hy'shqa J37, Suttles J40, Eclipse J41, Star J46, Notch J47, and Ti'lem I'nges J49</b>, as well a few others. There were some breaches, inverted tail slaps, dorsal fin slaps, pec slaps, cartwheels, spy hops, aerial scans, and kelpings too. What an incredible day it was!...J50 is a goofy little thing that is really fun to watch. She was playing with <b>J42</b> yesterday and being difficult for mama <b>J16. J51</b> stayed close to <b>J41</b> and was even right in the middle of a social group. -Melisa Pinnow

Got to spend some time with<b> J pod</b> today!! I had never seen resident orcas swim through <b>Active Pass</b> until today and it was crazy! Granny J2 and Alki J36 in Active Pass. The orcas were very spread out as they headed up Swanson Channel but <b>Shachi J19, Eclipse J41, and J51</b> were the first to make it to the entrance of the pass. They then waited for the rest of J pod to join them. Last to arrive was Granny J2 and Onyx L87. Granny then breached and tail slapped and everyone swam into the pass together! As they traveled through the pass, many of the orcas tail and pec slapped, inverted tail slapped, spy hopped, and breached. Once they exited <b>Active Pass</b>, the orcas calmed down, spread way out again, and aimed for northern Georgia Strait. What an amazing day!!! -Melisa Pinnow

This is the only photo I received of the <b>Killer Whales that were off the Mendonoma Coast</b>...first spotted by Fish Rocks (off of Anchor Bay), and traveling south. I did hear they spent some time near Cook's Beach (off north Gualala). Lots of CA Sea Lions here and of course Gray Whales passing by. Hope this photo helps. It was taken by Tom Eckles - he lives to my south and when I caught a glimpse of the Orcas I called him. -Jeanne Jackson

We caught up with <b>Big Mama (BCY0324) in northern Haro Strait</b> today as she traveled first north and then northeast towards Turn Point. Despite the rain we had a lovely day out on the water with one beautiful whale! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:45am -</b>  I got a message that<b> 5-6 orcas</b> were seen south of me off <b>Gualala CA</b> and headed south. Turned out they spent some time hanging off Gualala River Beach. Jeanne Jackson did see a couple of the orcas. There was also a report of a mother Gray Whale and calf in this vicinity, too. -Scott Mercer

It was very wet outside, but we found <b>gray whale #22 </b>(left flank) by <b>Hat Island (Gedney) </b>, traveling back and forth feeding along the shallow areas. #22 is one of the two known females who frequent our local waters, so it was a treat to see her. -Jill Hein/Naturalist on Mystic Sea

12 March update - Orca watchers, another update of location of tagged whale <b>L84</b>. On the last update on <b>9 March the tagged whale was off of Hoh Head</b> at mid-day heading south. By the morning of the <b>10th he was near Sea Lion Rock</b> where they turned north again and by that <b>afternoon were off Destruction Island</b>. Starting that evening, L84's tag shifted to an every other day transmission schedule to conserve power. Consequently, there is a large jump between that location and subsequent ones to the south with them being directly off Grays Harbor this morning. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

<b>9:00am Gray whales</b> this lovely morning along <b>Langley Beach on Whidbey Island </b>in the Saratoga Passage of the Salish Sea. Luckily we were having coffee on the deck and heard them breathing up the passage. And then they appeared. Feeding on ghost shrimp by rotating through the water to stir up the shrimp embedded in the sand with their fins. It is quite a ballet to watch as these mammoth sized creatures pirouette horizontally through the sea. -Debra Campbell Designs

9 March update - On Friday 6, March our colleagues at Cascadia Research Collective intercepted <b>L84</b> the tagged whale and a few others <b>off La Push</b> as the whales moved south. They did not see L121 or any of the whales it would be associated with it as the other whales appeared to be extremely spread out. They were able to collect 4 prey and 3 fecal samples that day. The whales continued slowly south reaching Cape Elizabeth by the early morning hours of the 8th. Here they turned north and by early this morning they were <b>off La Push</b> before they again turned south, occurring off of Hoh Head by mid-day today.- Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

We were heading north to<b> Point No Point </b>to do some salmon fishing this morning when we sighted <b>a pod of orcas </b>coming toward us, just north of and very close to the Point.  We watched them from <b>8:30 AM until 10:00 AM </b>as they spent time <b>between PNP and Whidbey Island</b>. They were in the tide line between us and Double Bluff, then they moved southeast toward Jefferson Head, then returned closer to Point No Point.  They ended up heading south again and went out of sight. We could see their spouts in the distance in the bright sun. There were <b>approximately 10 - 12 orcas</b>, of many different sizes. There was at least one large adult male. Some of the time they appeared to be feeding, as they were close together and very active. Other times they appeared to be in a more restful state.   We saw some spy-hopping and some tail-slapping.  It was thrilling to see them for such a long time. Salmon fishing wasn't good (I'd leave, too, if I were a salmon!)  We hope the orcas had better success! -Dianne Edmonds
(<i>Through photos, the orcas were identified by Melisa Pinnow &amp; Josh McInnes: T<b>137's, T037A's (plus T037), T036B's (plus T036)</b>  &amp; Possible <b>T099</b> was there too.</i>)

<b>Until 6pm they were still milling back and forth same general area a bit SE of Pt No Pt</b>!

Since our 25 February update we have continued to follow <b>L and K pods</b> onboard the Bell M. Shimada. During that time the whales movements have been <b>confined to the coastal waters and northern Oregon</b>. They were <b>offshore of Westport</b> on the 25th and by the 26th had moved to the nearshore waters off Westport. From there they turned south and by the morning of the 27th had traveled <b>as far south as Tillimook Head in northern Oregon</b>. From there they headed back north and by the 28th were offshore of <b>Westport again</b>. On the morning of 1 March we followed them north to <b>near LaPush</b>. Over the course of the 2nd they moved south and were just <b>north of Ocean Shores</b> this morning. One interesting aspect of their behavior over the past several days was that the whales have been <b>extremely spread out</b> - over several miles - both north and south and east and west. Thus, while we were able to launch the Zodiac and find a few whales and collect additional prey and fecal samples, we did not see all the whales on a given day. Consequently, we <b>didn't run into L94 so we don't have any additional reports on L121</b>. Because we had to be back in Newport by 3 March, the last day of our 21 day cruise, and given that northern Washington is over a day's run from Newport, we headed south on the evening of 1 March and spent the daylight hours of the 2nd transiting along the shelf break in Washington where we observed<b> Pacific white-sided dolphins, northern right whale dolphins, Risso's dolphins, as well as sperm whales, numerous fin whales</b>, numerous black-footed albatrosses, and a couple of Laysans's albatrosses. -Dr. Brad Hanson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:40pm -  </b>The whale (<b>humpback</b>) was just <b>north of Shipwreck</b> and close to shore -- last time I spotted it it was heading south towards shipwreck when it did a deep dive... I watched for another half hour before we cruised back to Edmonds Marina. The whale was very elusive...north then south quick surface and longer dives. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:40pm - humpback </b>was blowing and fluking about every two minutes as it turned south out of sight close to shore.

<b>3:30pm -</b> A friend of mine sent me this report from today. "This afternoon while walking in <b>Ft. Ward, (Bainbridge Island)</b> I saw a whale spout and then saw it's back. Looked like a <b>gray whale maybe</b>. Only one whale as far as I could see. It was towards Rich Passage, just past the fish farm, heading in the Bremerton direction. -Susan Marie Andersson for Marcy Lagerloef

As we followed the <b>T124s and T086As</b>. We found them around <b>Beaver Point Salt Spring Island in Swanson Channel heading Southeast</b> in a flood tide. They were moving at an average speed of 6.2 knots and covered a distance of 4.2 nm. They came into within 10m of a harbor seal but no interaction was recorded. They did short 15-20 second long dives followed by a 2-3 minute extended dive. -Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:05pm-5:00pm - </b>John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research was with the <b>humpback in Possession Sound off of Edmonds</b> and obtained ID photos and a skin sample. He believes it is a <b>1 - 2 year old juvenile humpback</b> whale that looked to be engaged in feeding. We'll let you know if he is able to match this whale with any in the catalogues.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:35pm -</b> We saw it <b>North of Edmonds ferry </b>, mid-channel <b>headed south</b>. -Tamara Walker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:05pm - </b>Haven't seen it in about an hour. I'm guessing that if it continues on its path, it should be south of <b>Edmonds</b> by now. -Charles Vendley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>9:00am - </b>Whale sighting in<b> Hood Canal</b> this morning at<b> Ayock Point</b>. Very rare for us. This one had a small curved fin near the rear. Could this be a Finn whale? (Minke?) I think you are right. It was a <b>Minke whale</b>.
