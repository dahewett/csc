<br/> 
Our evening trip. <b>Star, J46</b>. I'm giving her a 10 on her forward lunge breach! -Capt Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Even though it's still summer, this felt like a fall day! But captains Monte and Eric steered us through the raindrops to first get a good look at <b>a lone gray whale by Kellet Ledge in Rosario Strait</b>, then headed up toward <b>San Juan Island to catch up with some of K pod and L pod</b>. We got great looks at the young male <b>K25 Scoter, lovely female K20 Spock and her son K38 Comet</b>, and a few more males and females, approximately 10 whales. They were quite active, breaching, tail slapping, spyhopping, porpoising, some hunting for fish, and generally headed first south and then west. Even though it was cloudy, the water was glass smooth, creating beautiful patterns as the whales surfaced and dove, with their big "whoosh" of breath announcing their presence. What a privilege to see them, as always! ...-Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K13s and L55s were on the west side of San Juan Island</b>...they were very active. -Jill Hein
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>12:35 pm. -</b> The north group seems to be crossing the strait- mid channel now.
<br/><b>12:25 p.m. - </b>Doesn't look like they all came down- at least only about 15 here with no more in sight Seeing some more boats way north now <b>K13s and L4s </b>only so far I think
<br/><b>12:07 p.m. - K13s</b> in lead. Crazy spread! 5 whales only so far. L118 Jade and the nearly ten month-old L123 this afternoon at Lime Kiln State Park. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

What another Killer Day off <b>Sooke, B.C.</b> We headed on reports of <b>incoming Transients coming west from Race Rocks</b>...but 6 minutes from our docks we find <b>some of J, K &amp; L going west</b>. L72 Racer  - Juan de Fuca. -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

WOW! Transient Killer Whales <b>(T11`s &amp; T37`s) in Sooke Harbour &amp; Basin</b> for almost 3 hours TODAY! At least 3 seal kills and some great energy and playful action. -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
  
The <b>T-60's made several trips around Race Rocks</b> this afternoon. -Jim Cosgrove

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Lone <b>gray whale by Kellet Ledge, Rosario Strait</b>. -Bonnie Gretz, August 31, 2016 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A new <b>gray whale </b>in the area, Wednesday August 31st. Seen by <b>Boulder Island, south end of Lopez.</b> The "new" gray whale in the area is known to Cascadia Research, it's <b>CRC#37</b>, first spotted in 1988, but not seen in Puget Sound before...this whale was seen as far east as Dungeness Spit in 2008. -Jill Hein

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:21 p.m. - </b>They're now offshore of <b>Land Bank</b> facing south not really going anywhere.
<br/><b>2:00 p.m. - They're just approaching Land Bank</b>. Seem spread...Milling, some offshore some in shore, but still trending north at the moment. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was the <b>L-121 Windsong</b> show Tuesday morning from the shores of <b>Grandmas Cove (American Camp, San Juan Island)</b>. He was quite energetic with multiple breaches, rolls, pec/dorsal/tail slaps. L94 Calypso and her son L121 Windsong off south San Juan Island. Whales came within 100' of shore. -Ariel Yseth

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. -</b> Whale Sighting. <b>4 orcas</b> traveling. My Son-inlaw sent this picture to me <b>off the spit in Port Angeles</b> today. He said there were 4 of them 2 babies and 2 adults. The dorsal fin of one of them was about 5 feet high. He also heard from someone that they traveled into the Port Angeles bay by the coast guard station. -Doris Williamson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At one point about <b>50 yards off shore at Point No Point</b>. We watched from about <b>7:50 until 8:20</b> as it was feeding <b>between Norwegian Point and Point No Point</b>, just meandering. -Marilyn DeRoy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

<b>14:37 - Common dolphins off Meadow Point (Golden Gardens, north Seattle)</b>, 400 yards out: I'm either looking at harbor porpoises on crack, or those are (un)common dolphins tearing it up! Slowly undulating south, jumping completely out of the water and making my task of doing the dishes slightly less mundane. -Ben Blankenship

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:06 p.m. -</b> Yay! I would figure <b>about 40 passed LK, including members of all 3 pods. I saw J11s, J19s, J22s, K13s, K14s, L4s</b>.  There are some Southbound from Eagle. -Monika Wieland

<b>11:30 a.m. - Orca inside Port Angeles</b>, WA. Harbor. <b>5 total</b> (2 small and 1 large juvenile, a female and possible male). They were here late morning today. Feeding at first, then casually left the harbor. There was one on the outside of the harbor all by itself. Wonderful morning watching the Orca in our harbor in Port Angeles, WA . I know it happens, but I have lived here 36 years and never seen them in our harbor before. So exciting! -Merri McDonald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Monday evening while out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. The group of passengers was awesome, the weather perfect, and the whales stunning! Plus I was finally able to "meet" the <b>T18s, T36, T19, and T18, near Patos Island</b>.  -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

...we resumed course towards <b>Patos Island</b> in search of Bigg's Killer Whales (Transient Orcas)! We had quite the encounter today, with <b>upwards of 30 whales</b> displaying feeding behavior. Whale groups identified included the<b> T- 18s, 19s, 34s, 36s, 37s, 65As, and 99s!</b> This extraordinary meetup of whales gave a great insight onto how they feed -- slapping their tails and spyhopping...-Amy W., Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 a.m. -</b> Coastal &amp; Unidentified killer whales - Several <b>(5) orca seen today about 5 miles off Cox Bay, west coast BC</b>. Moving southbound. -Amy Schneider McElfresh

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:40 p.m. - Humpback by Point No Point</b>. Going north. Spouts and flukes. -Benjamin Obee

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found <b>two groups of 6-7 transients between Spieden and Sentinel Islands</b>. One group was lunching on a seal when we arrived on scene. Mystic Sea stayed with this group as they traveled towards Green Point, stopping for food several times along the way. While feeding, passengers were able to watch as these orcas spyhopped, breached, and slapped their tails - preparing their prey for consumption. -Amy W., Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Playful <b>Transients off Spieden Island this morning</b>. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:40 a.m. - Transients in Spieden Channel</b> hugging the south side of Spieden shoreline-westbound north of Sentinel. Looks like 2 groups total of <b>8-10 orcas</b>, surfacing and long dives. Several boats including a huge yacht that thought they were a whale watching boat. -Peggy Mauro

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:19 p.m. - Humpback at Point No Point</b> harassing boater? The humpback is <b>following a boat</b>, going under, tail slapping and seemingly pushing the boat. Boater appears to be trying to back away but whale is staying with them. Seems like the boat either pissed the whale off or it is in love :). Looks like the whale has moved on. Wish these boaters would keep their distance better. -Patty Michak
<br/>(<i>some "friendly" humpbacks are curious enough to approach boaters and interact, we call this a mugging, it is benign - ALB</i>) 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:41 p.m. - One or two whales going north in front of Point No Point </b>right now. Probably humpbacks. At one point we saw a tail coming straight out of the water. -Judy Anderson Soupe

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpback in Skunk Bay around 10am</b>. 1 milling around a boat and kayaks, then headed south. -Lisa Cheever

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Another great day on the water ...<b>20+ Humpbacks just west of Sooke, BC. - Juan de Fuca</b>  -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spotted <b>four harbour porpoise swimming past East Point, Saturna island around 8.00pm</b> today plus plenty of seals. -Sandra Arthur

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:00 Noon - I saw at least 3 harbour porpoises while I was surfing at Hobuck Beach in Neah Bay</b>. They were swimming together close to the surfers, for at least an hour. Closest the came to me was about 20 feet. It was about high tide, around 12 pm. -Jeanne Cavenaugh

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 27</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Juan de Fuca -</b> We had a great group today that braved the excitement of nautical seas and had the pleasure of visiting <b>4 Humpbacks and some regular Transient / Biggs Whales T011 &amp; T011A arund Sooke</b> waters today...Good Times! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Patos Island area - We found <b>a humpback whale at at Patos Island</b> and watched closely for around 45 minutes as it swam and showed us its fluke. We then continued on to East Point where we observed <b>a group of transient orcas</b> for a bit before starting our return venture home. -Amy W.. Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:35 p.m. - Puget Sound -</b> I think the group may have split while we were <b>watching them from Mutiny Sands at 11:15 am</b>. After spotting 'the tight group of <b>8-10 powering north</b>', it looked as though some pulled off west while 2-3 slowed up and seemed to be moving towards Whidbey Island, but then headed north again. We went on to <b>Bush Point and continued to watch this group</b> as they approached Marrowstone. Now sounds as if the group that may have pulled off west have made a later appearance off Bush Point and have become 'the trailers'. -Sandra Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Now nodule <b>Pt Marrowstone side still north bound but only 4 animals</b>, 2 males and 2 females, <b>T18 and T19s</b>. -Christopher Hanke

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:45 p.m. - Orca sighting just off Marrowstone Island</b>. my girlfriend and I were sailing in the Admiralty inlet heading south east  toward Port Ludlow and we happened upon<b> two Male orcas</b> that were travelling northwest toward port Townsend. We were just off <b>Liplip Point Marrowstone island</b>. We captured a short video which is attached to this email. We suppose they were two males because the fins were extremely large! We first noticed them due to the breathing and then saw the fins. We turned north and could see them surfacing for another 20 min or so. -Chris Rosenthal and Casey Herron

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:36 p.m. - Watching them right now from Fort Casey</b>. They're pretty close to shore on the Whidbey side headed North. We could see them from Frank Robinson beach, but they were pretty far out from the bay. -Melissa Gail Banks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>2 pm</b>, Greg Davis called to report <b>four or more orcas off the north end of Marrowstone</b>, continuing NW out of Admiralty Inlet. This is probably the first group...

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Pat Scott called at <b>1:50 pm to report a pod of 6 orcas</b>, no males,<b> passing Bush Pt</b>. heading NW.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:57 p.m. - </b>Just now, seeing blows and fins from <b>Lagoon Point</b> but far on other side. Still a little south of Lagoon Point. -Patricia Prochaska

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:14 p.m. -</b> Just now<b> approaching Bush Pt</b>, watched them pass here, south of Bush Pt, close to the Whidbey side. Saw <b>2 males, a female and juvenile</b> for sure. Traveling NW up Admiralty Inlet at a pretty good pace, looked like maybe a stop for a kill or hunt. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:42 a.m. - Off Mutiny Bay</b>. Going North. Slowly. -Helen Shamek

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:12 a.m. -  Tight group of 8-10 powering north off Mutiny Bay</b>, Whidbey Island. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. - About ten orcas</b> were reported by Gary Stubbs from <b>Maxwelton Beach</b>, Whidbey Island, heading north roughly mid-channel but more on the Whidbey side.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was a tough day today with no orcas in the general area and weather and high seas prohibiting access to other areas. While searching for transient orcas around seal haul-outs, we found a <b>10-year-old humpback whale known as "Split Fin" BCZ0298</b>, born in 2006 to "Big Mama" BCY0324, near <b>Patos Island</b>. Split Fin was on 7-8 minute dive intervals searching for krill and small fish. -Brendon Bissonnette

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We found <b>a humpback whale at at Patos Island</b> and watched closely for around 45 minutes as it swam and showed us its fluke. We then continued on to East Point where we observed a group of transient orcas for a bit before starting our return venture home. -Amy W., Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:26 p.m. - Puget Sound - Just heard whale blows at Point No Point,</b> 4 distinct blows so maybe a small group traveling past. (<i>Humpbacks seen next morning</i>). -Patty Michak

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 26</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>J28 Polaris - Haro Strait -</b> Got to watch <b>J28, J46, and J54</b> from shore for hours. We did see J46 actively lunging and chasing salmon, so I am hopeful she shared some with her mother. I have to remain hopeful that whatever is going on with J28, she can overcome it.

It was pretty bonkers today up north! Big beautiful resting group all the way along the bank travelling about 1.5 knots. They hit the <b>coal port</b> - Georgia Strait - and then I've never seen anything like it......It looked like <b>the majority of Group A just started launching</b>!! Caught a few, <b>J19 Shachi breach, J37 Hy'Shqa launches</b> too, but missed a lot of them....no idea where to point the camera. -Gary Sutton

Later this afternoon we saw another <b>J-Pod group (with J2, L87, and J16s among them) way up north (south of Point Roberts)</b>. L87 Onyx was traveling with J2 Granny and another J pod whale in Georgia Strait.Lots of social behaviors, spyhops, tail and pec slaps, rolling around, cuddle puddles, you name it, they did it). -Astrid Heinisch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I've been thinking about <b>J28 "Polaris"</b> and her family ever since I heard the news that she wasn't doing well. When I heard whales were sighted I had to go and watch from shore. It was nice and cool by the water compared to inland near town. As bittersweet as it was, I am glad I went and spent the time at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. Got to watch <b>J28, J46, and J54 </b>from shore for hours. We did see J46 actively lunging and chasing salmon, so I am hopeful she shared some with her mother. I have to remain hopeful that whatever is going on with J28, she can overcome it. For her sake and the sake of the Southern Resident Killer Whale community, I have to keep up the hope. -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

When I left at <b>3:30 the J17s were still off Land Bank</b>, but may have been actually moving south after hanging there for the last 4 hours. J22s looked to be off False Bay based on boat locations.
<br/><b>2:05 p.m. - J17s &amp; J22s</b> very spread and foraging from <b>Lime Kiln to False Bay</b>, facing south but not really moving. Shore-based encounter with the J17 matriline off  Sand Juan County Land Bank's Westside Preserve. Everyone was there - including J28 Polaris - but she's still looking really underweight. Notice the depressions around her blowhole and eyepatches. She's clearly a fighter! Hoping by some miracle she finds a way to pull through. -Monika Wieland

With soaring temperatures, out on the water was the best place to be... Just beyond <b>San Juan Channel we spotted a Minke whale</b> surfacing, before continuing along the <b>west side of San Juan where the J22's, Oreo (J22), mother of Doublestuf (J34) and Cookie (J38)</b> were moving in a southerly direction with evidence of feeding patterns (milling) along the way. It's always a delight to see these closely bonded whales in their family groups. Our return journey took us past Whale Rocks, where a number of magnificent Steller sea-lions were holding court among the cormorants and oyster-catchers we were fortunate to get a glimpse of today. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. - </b>foraging as they still slowly go north. I only positively identified <b>Js</b> but didn't see all of them, some were maybe still south and there may have been more than Js present, tough lighting.
<br/><b>1:40 p.m. - I know J2, J19s, J14s, J16s </b>were in lead group that went north, but wasn't sure who all was in that next big group with all the babies from the initial pass. <b>J28</b> was in that big foraging group of moms and juveniles <b>off Land Bank at 1:40</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:50 p.m. -</b> heard them before I saw them, a<b> group of 4 Orca (including 1 adult male) coming up from Discovery Bay</b>, north along the shores of Cape George. They were blowing loudly and slapping their tails on the water...playing as they traveled lazily along the shore. What a sight to behold! ... I lost sight of them in the darkness as they head north to the straits. Feeding, playing, traveling, avoiding whale watching boats, breaching, slapping tails on the surface, flapping fins on the surface. -Terri Brown

I went out to <b>Washington Park - Rosario Strait</b>, overlooking Burrows Pass (SW Anacortes), to do a Harbor Porpoise survey. Only saw 4 Harbor Porpoise but at 4:30 pm I heard blows that were not from any porpoise. A Gray Whale had just entered the east end of the pass, blew a couple times, dove and resurfaced at the west end of the pass. Love field work, you just never know what you'll see. -Pattie Hutchins

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Took a comp day and spent several hour scoping from various West beach locations. While looking at some harbor porpoises, a shape appeared behind them, disturbing some gulls and auklets on the water. I continued watching and saw a form rise and clearly saw the scimitar shape dorsal fin come up a couple more times. It scattered seabirds each time it rose. This was just<b> south and a bit west of Smith Island at about 3:15 pm</b>. This is my 2nd ever <b>Minke</b> sighting with the 1st being years ago when one crossed the bow of the ferry coming from Port Townsend. Not long after <b>a pod of at least 4 orcas came through between the island and the beach</b>- very close with lots of splashing! Whales rock!! -Steve Ellis

In the early morning there were reports of <b>many southern resident killer whales up near the Coal Docks at Tsawassen</b>, and they gradually moved down <b>toward Point Roberts</b> as the morning progressed. Ken was in Port Angeles arranging for a boat house for keeping a vessel on the Olympic Peninsula for autumn encounters with the whales when they typically shift to a diet that includes Chum salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus keta</i>) headed for spawning in Puget Sound rivers. There do not seem to be enough King salmon (<i>O. tshawytscha</i>) this year headed for spawning in Salish Sea rivers, particularly the Fraser, to entice all of the SRKWs to come into the region or stay very long, so maybe we will get a chance to get a comprehensive Orca Survey later this year. Readers of our encounter summaries should also keep up with status of eastern pacific stocks of salmon and fishery management in this classic predator/prey drama. We will refer to this subject in special reports, news articles and blogs as time goes on...-Center for Whale Research Encounter 88

We spent the afternoon with a beautiful, tight group of <b>Southern Residents as they headed north in Haro Strait</b>. We were with the <b>K13's, L4's, L26's, and L47's</b>. They traveled up the west side in such a large group - this isn't something we've seen very much of this year. It was such a joy to see, it used to be common, these days it is rare due to scarcity of Chinook salmon. We left them at Battleship Island as they continued up Haro Strait beside two huge bulk carriers.   -Barbara and David

Sunshine and whale reports, a great start to our adventure today! As we motored into Rosario Strait, we had a report of <b>transient (Biggs Orcas, meat-eating type) coming in in an easterly direction</b>. However, we then heard there were <b>residents right along Hein Bank</b>, much closer. After a quick stop at Colville Island to see harbor seals, we caught up with big male<b> L92 Crewser and more of L pod </b>as they headed straight for San Juan Island. After some nice time with them, we moved further out toward Hein Bank and enjoyed watching<b> L72 Racer</b>, as well as <b>part of J pod</b>. Overall, we saw <b>an estimated 20 whales from all three pods</b>, though very spread out and mostly traveling. Very nice smooth water, warm temperatures, and great views of our resident orcas! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

I watched <b>a small group of orcas approach from the east end of Bullman Beach</b>; they moved steadily westward near the edge of the kelp beds then lost them as they neared Sail and Seal Rock. Soon, <b>one of three gray whales </b>I had been watching for quite some time and closely after seeing the orcas, who was feeding between those rocks and the shore, suddenly leapt far out of the water.  <b>The orcas appeared</b>, leaping and diving about in the same place. They continued for a half of an hour according to my camera footage clock before I had to leave home. I could not see thru my video viewer well enough and later found I kept panning back and forth past them. Ohh *%*# heartbreaking.  I did not see any of the grays for some hours, they were immediately silent and unseen for the rest of the evening.
I went out on the water early this afternoon<b> (August 23), seeing three grays about.</b> I was able to view two closely but not the third, who is staying very close to shore west of Sail and Seal Rock and Sail River. I will try again Wednesday to view her. I know there were a number of people watching from a viewpoint above Snow Creek so we may find some good video if someone mentions it on line...our location is <b>just east of Neah Bay</b>. Been here for &gt;35 years. -Maureen

We had a call from Loren Goldman in Vancouver tonight, he was reporting <b>a pod of ~ 10 orcas off Pt. Roberts, 7 pm</b>, breaching, tail lobbing, and more for 40 minutes, then traveling from west to east toward the San Juans. He said he this summer has been the worst for seeing whales (this was one of his first times this summer), and that he had heard that it was the worst season for Chinook salmon in BC in over 100 years.

<b>5:20 p.m. - Orca off Clover Point</b>, Victoria, but such crazy winds we lost them. One large male with one other. Very close to shore mixed in with kiteboarders.... A mother and baby ended up <b>corralling a seal right up to the rocks of the Oak Bay marina!</b> (We were parked off beach drive) We followed them up <b>till 8pm</b> when they turned back to Trial Island...All together there were <b>6 transients</b>. Markus says two females, one baby and three males. But at first we saw only two males and one female but then three more appeared in Oak Bay. -Maria Peronino

A hot summer's day into a warm summers night on <b>Haro Strait.

Such a gift to watch little <b>J52</b> (among all the among all the others) engaged in some excellent breaches, tail lobs, spyhops, and more.  Their presence traveling up and down island continued into the dark of night where we sat, under a blanket of stars (&amp; planets), listening to above water exhalations while listening to live underwater vocals of the same Southern Resident orcas as they drift southbound....dreamy. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

K13s were the first. <b>K25 Scoter</b> spent a lot of time foraging back and forth out from Land Bank. Another group arrived grouped up, maybe that was <b>L47s</b>? Then a few more. Looking south I did not see anymore coming so came up to house. Happily surprised short time later when more showed up, at lease 4 probably more like 6.  Two open saddle individuals  (L72 and L105), then looked like L92 Crewser at rear with an adolescent (<b>L110</b>). I look forward to expert ID's, but I'd say approx 20+ whales? (Thanks to Monika Wieland for ID help/confirmation)

A breaching <b>humpback</b>! On yet another glorious summer's day, Mystic Sea cut through clear, calm seas towards Port Angeles where we encountered <b>juvenile humpback 'Split Fin' (BCZ0298)</b>, calf of 'Big Mama' (BCY0324), another of our well-known visiting humpbacks. No-one knows how 'Split Fin' sustained the original injury, but it was good to see this playful and curious young whale exhibiting an explosive breach followed by some exuberant tail-slapping with those mighty flukes. Humpbacks, the most acrobatic of the great whales, have made a welcome return to our local waters, impressing whale watchers with their sheer size and power and providing everlasting memories. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

I'm not sure if any of you are interested in these two sightings of <b>common dolphins near Bellingham</b>, but here they are just in case. Attached is a photo from the first sighting.  Below is the information for each one. WDFW personnel (Fenner Yarborough, Paul DeBruyn) spotted 8-10 common dolphins on 8/19 at 48.728988  -122.594725  while doing surf scoter surveys. Species was confirmed by Whale Museum. We have more pictures if need.  There was 1 possible juvenile in the group, we noticed this by its continual jumping out of the water. WDFW personnel spotted 10-12 common dolphins on 8/21 just south of Vendovi Island.  No GPS point was taken. -Gary J. Wiles, WDFW

A friend messaged me early this morning to tell me their were orcas in front of her house and they were heading north up the shoreline! I sprang out of bed, grabbed my gear, and off <b>to the lighthouse</b> we went. We waited eagerly for the <b>whales</b> and as they passed by us, they left us in awe. Just feet from the shore, you could see them underwater as they rolled through the kelp. Understandably, waking up in this manner is a very good way to begin the day. -Katie Jones

Great Way to Start the Day!! <b>Epic pass at Lime Kiln this morning</b>. Yes, that is the kelp and shoreline. Several whales passed just a few feet from shore.

Around <b>8 AM the first whales came into sight south of Lime Kiln</b>, moving slowly north against the ebb tide. From about 8:15-8:45 <b>J2 Granny took her time cruising by, followed by some of the K14s.</b> Then we had the <b>J11s, J14s, J16s, and J19s</b> pass right off the rocks in two tight groups - always an amazing sight to witness but even more so in the gorgeous early morning light when you could see them underwater! Next, further offshore, came the <b>K16s and K21 </b>in a tight group, and bringing up the rear were <b>L87 Onyx and J45 Se-Yi-Chn</b>. By 10 they were all north of the lighthouse and continuing on their way up Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute

<b>Humpback whales - central/south Puget Sound </b>- We received a call at about <b>8:20 pm</b> tonight from Rosemary Teforo who was calling from Vashon Island, at the end of Manzanita Rd. They were watching a whale 500 ft. away from shore, going back and forth, headed toward Portage, had been there at least 10 - 15 minutes. They thought it was in trouble, seemed to be very close to shore. They confirmed it had a dorsal fin, so not a gray whale feeding.
At 9:30 Rosemary's sister Elizabeth called, saying it was still there, <b>100 yards from shore</b>, breathing a lot and they were afraid it was stranding. While I was on the phone with them I got a message from Amy Carey - she couldn't get there before dark, but called a friend who lives near there, and her friend had been watching it for the last 45 minutes. It was at the<b> mouth of Quartermaster Harbor</b>, a place they don't usually go, but it seemed to be doing deep dives and breathing and acting normal, and they saw it breach and species was <b>confirmed as humpback</b>. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Sunday we started with heavy fog, so Capt. Monte took us through the San Juan Islands, to the north end where we had whale reports of K-pod whales "in thick fog". A good choice - by the time we arrived with the whales the fog had lifted and the sun was shining!! We identified members of the <b>K12 and K13 matrilines, very spread out along the shoreline, traveling southbound past the Center for Whale Research and San Juan Island's the West Side Reserve</b>. Many many breaches, what a thrill for us all to witness. It's such a privilege to see our Resident whales in the Salish Sea again, let's hope they'll find enough chinook salmon to keep them here. Homeward bound we found seal moms with pups, harbor porpoise, turkey vultures and a bald eagle. A foggy day turned into a truly beautiful day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

With the welcome return of <b>K pod </b>(the endangered Southern Resident orca population is made up of three pods, J, K and L, totaling 83 in number) to our local waters, Mystic Sea headed past Lopez Island and along the west side of San Juan Island and Lime Kiln State Park (also known as Whale Watch Park) towards Stuart Island, where we encountered <b>K pod whales, including K22 (Sekiu) and her son K33 (Tika)</b>, a 'sprouter' male born in 2001, passing Turnpoint Lighthouse. With the whales in traveling mode, we witnessed a number of energetic breaches and tail-slaps as they hunted for salmon, though a mature bald eagle deprived them of one tasty morsel and enjoyed a substantial lunch on the nearby rocks. We left the whales heading towards Saturna Island, B.C., and continued on our scenic trip back to Anacortes passing between Shaw and Orcas Islands on yet another truly glorious Pacific Northwest day. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

After being gone for nearly two months (!!), it's been awesome to have <b>members of K-Pod around again</b> over the last week, and very interesting to see how they're splitting up and mixing and matching with J-Pod in ways that are different from last summer. <b>K12 Sequim and K43 Saturna were off Spieden Island this afternoon.

We caught up with the closer group of <b>T46 transients about 6 miles south of Lopez</b> and spent a lovely time with five of them, most traveling fairly fast south west. Included in this group were <b>the female T46</b>, who is estimated to be 52 years old, and was the last orca captured in Budd Inlet, in Puget Sound, in 1976, and released. She is now a great-grandmother! Also seen were T46E, a young male who was born in 2003, and T46D, another young male, born in 2000. Both of these bulls have already "sprouted" (dorsal fin growing) to impressive size... -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

I don't think I've ever seen <b>so many transient (mammal-hunting) orcas together at one time</b>. <b>T065As, T018/T019s and others with Vancouver city in the background.</b> Usually these orcas rely on smaller numbers and stealth to exploit their intelligent prey. However,  this massive grouping of matrilines stayed in the same spot in the Strait of Georgia doing circles for HOURS in the same spot, predating on harbor porpoise occasionally and interacting with one another. Lot's of vocalizations, social behavior, and breeding ... others even joined in the ceremony later in the evening, probably hearing their vocals some miles away. It was simply an incredible thing to observe. -Heather MacIntyre

They all flipped and <b>went back south as of 8:30 PM, angling offshore again</b>. I'm still wondering who was off the south end yesterday and this morning. <b>J2, J14s, J16s, J19s, K12s, K13s, and K14s are whales that went north yesterday and came back south today</b>. Not sure if the rest of Js have been down there or if some Ls are mixed in or what. I've heard a couple people say some Ls are here but no one who has actually seen them.

Puget Sound (live strand) - She was moving around <b>Fauntleroy Cove at day break</b> when WS Ferry staff first took notice. They called it in as <b>a sighting and then a stranding</b> once it was clear she was in distress. As the tide receded, she beached and lovely devoted humans did their best to keep her comfortable. I arrived about 15 minutes before she <b>took her last breath just before 11:00 a.m</b>. As the tide continued to ebb, her beautiful young body lay more exposed. From her appearance it was clear she was emaciated. Her long graceful white pec fins stood out. Researchers and staff from all entities, NOAA, Cascadia Research, DFW, Seattle Aquarium, Stranding Networks, Seal Sitters, and probably others were present. Much gratitude to all responders. A prelimiary exam was conducted telling us she was a <b>1-1/2-3 year-old juvenile and she is 39 feet long</b>. Many of us naturalists lined along the ferry dock answered questions through out the day. She was towed in the evening at high tide to a private location for full necropsy. This is nature's cycle, and maybe humans somehow played a role in her death, we will not know until results of a full necropsy are shared, either way it is sad such a young being lost her life. Looking in the eye of a giant creature who has just passed is a moment etched in my being forever. I am relieved she did not have to suffer too long under her own weight. Rest little one. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>11:23 a.m. - Eight to a dozen dolphins</b> have flipped, flopped, fished and played "follow the boats" in <b>Pickering Passage for over 2 hours this morning</b>. They came from the north but stayed in the passage about <b>1/4 mile from the Harstine Island Bridge</b> for the full 2 hours. They have been leaping and swimming in circles in multiple places to fish. Last seen following a boat wake under the Harstine Island Bridge.

Another beautiful sunny day and an early whale report took us north along Bellingham Channel on a search - Resident Killer Whales far far up north in Canada, but another whale watch boat saved the day by finding <b>Transient/Biggs killer whales north of Patos Island</b>! The whales were heading away from us at a fast clip, and spread out, we had some great looks at the <b>T65s and T34s, with possibly some T37s in the distance</b>. A nearby harbor seal avoided detection by these mammal eating whales - it was his lucky day! After some quality time watching these magnificent mammals, we reluctantly left them, finding seals with new pups on several rocky haulouts, harbor porpoise and many bald eagles en route back to port. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Traveling out of Everett heading towards Mukilteo Thursday morning, August 4th, <b>spotted a whale breaching (surfacing?)</b> that had a blow hole or nostral visible, and then as it breached, approx. 25-30 feet back came up a small curved fin, approx. 18"-24" tall. Never had seen anything like this before, so researched when we got home and <b>looks like it was a fin whale</b>. -Wayne Jensen

Another beautiful day on the Salish Sea! We left the marina with news of resident orcas west but quite far and not moving much, but headed south west to find <b>humpbacks</b>. Which we did! With reports of multiple sightings, we were watching one, when Captain Eric spotted a big breach back toward the north east. We caught up with <b>Split Fin BCZ0298 (2006 offspring of BCY0324 Big Mama) and Heather BCY0160 about 5 miles north of Dungeness Spit</b>, and watched them fluke up tail dive, skim along the surface, and even have a close encounter (with engines shut down!). Thrilling to see these big, majestic whales feeding along the current lines and one huge breach that we're hoping a passenger captured on film! Also spotted some adorable harbor seals, harbor porpoises and bald eagles. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

We left port with no whale reports so headed around the<b> south side of Lopez Island via Colville Island</b> to see the seals hauled out and - aha - <b>minke whale reports at Hein Bank, and humpbacks</b> a little further to the west! So off we headed in that direction. The trip was a little bumpy at times but Capt Eric kept us on a steady course - we found <b>a humpback a few miles west of Hein Bank</b> and had quality time viewing this gentle giant as (s)he fed in the area. There were a few good fluke (tail) shots, and a few "almost" fluke shots. Homeward bound we encountered two (or three) minke whales, still <b>near Hein Bank</b>. No orca today, but two of our favorite baleen whales were well worth watching! A long but enjoyable day aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>06:50 PM - My folks just saw a whale heading north in Pickering Passage north of Harstine Island bridge</b>. They heard it twice, thought there were two, then saw a big grey back roll out. No clear id but thought someone around the way might get one if they know to look out. No photos. We heard 1 breathing noise and then a 2d and we saw a whale body but could not identify it. It did not look like an orca or a pilot whale. We watched for a 3d breaching but did not see one. We heard what might have been a 3d breathing breech but did not see it. -Carl and Carol Hauge

<b>4:00 p.m. -Fin whale headed south passing Boston Harbor into Budd Inlet.</b> Turned around and headed north toward Squaxin. Turned around again and headed south down Eld Inlet.

<b>Juan de Fuca -</b> It was a long slog through the islands in fog today, but as gray skies gave way to blue intrepid whale watchers were rewarded for their patience by an engaging encounter with <b>a humpback whale near Port Angeles</b>. This whale was intrigued by our presence, so with engines cut we rolled around in the swell inhaling the 'sweet' smell of whale breath as the whale surfaced nearby, surprising passengers by exhaling a plume of rainbow colored vapor from two blowholes (the humpback is a baleen/rorqual whale). Not too many good photos on this trip due to boat movement, and sometimes it's fun to simply enjoy the moment in the presence of these magnificent creatures. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Today, the morning tour out of Anacortes with Island Adventures was lucky enough to encounter <b>a very curious female humpback.</b> We spent about 30 minutes with her and she gave us 3 encounters where she explored the boat, rolled over and gave us belly, sprayed us, and really checked us out. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had! Also hilarious because I had to abandon my 600mm lens fitter my iPhone to get the shots. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

My boyfriend and I were sitting on the shore near the <b>Des Moines Marina</b> looking into the Puget Sound, we both saw <b>a whale's tail</b> in the water. We kept an eye out to see it again and then to our surprise it surfaced and breached. We aren't completely sure whether it was an orca or other whale but it was shocking to see it so close to the shore an in an enclosed area of the Sound. Very awesome experience! -Natasha Polupan

I got to see the <b>common Dolphins in Steilacoom</b>. We saw them around <b>2pm</b> traveling north towards the Tacoma Narrows. I've read a lot that says there are only 2 or 3 of them but there were more than that. There were at least four. -Jennifer Concoby
