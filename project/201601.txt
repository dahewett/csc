31 January update - Since our <b>on the morning of the 27th K33 (and likely the rest of K pod) were traveling south had moved inshore and were off Hoh Head</b> on the northern Washington coast. They continued south to<b> just offshore of the entrance to the Columbia River by the morning of the 29th.</b> They turned back north, traveling about about half way up the Long Beach Peninsula by the evening 29th before turning back south. They were <b>off the mouth of the Columbia River by the morning of the 30th</b> and then turned back north to <b>off the entrance of Willapa Bay </b>before again heading south. They were <b>again off the Columbia by the morning of the 31st</b>. -Map courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

<b>9:43 a.m. - Unidentified whale - </b>Just noted spray and tail north of <b>Johnson Point, Case Inlet</b>, southeast of Harstine Island, southwest of Key Peninsula, heading west....too far away and mostly spray. Hump was dark and we did see a tail once. -Tina Davis

<b>About 3:00pm</b>. Saw <b>two maybe three orcas south Camano Island west side</b>. Second time I have seen orcas first time in my kayak. They where traveling south then came in close to shore maybe looking for something to eat. Picture was taken with a point and shoot water proof camera, south end of Camano Island west side just off shore of <b>Wilkes Gary Hts Road</b>. It is about a half mile up from the south tip of the Island. -Andrew Dillon

I want to report <b>what I think was a fin whale</b> sighting. I've done a lot of research and cannot find that it would be anything other than the fin whale. The color, length and serpentine-like shape tic all the boxes for a fin whale. It was sighted <b>by the lighthouse on Vashon Island</b> (Point Robinson) last weekend. Feeding and traveling. My friend and I saw the whale, light brown or light grey in color, long and serpentine in appearance, maybe 30 to 35 feet in length, and solitary. The length is a rough estimate of course. It came up a couple of times for air as it slithered along almost snake like, blowing spray from his (or her) blow hole, and then came up a third time and dove deeper, as its body rose up with greater undulation and disappeared. Maybe feeding? We didn't see it after that. -Celia Reno
<br/>My name is Tom. I am a friend of Celia's and I was with her when we sighted the whale from the eastside of Vashon Island. He was about 200 yards off shore. I've seen sea lions before and harbor seals, especially when I was living in Everett. I had a kayak and I would see them down by the Everett Waterfront. I know what we saw on the 23rd was nothing like those mammals. I've also seen Orcas in Puget Sound and Grey Whales and the whale we saw was different. This one was longer and its body undulated as it swam along. I saw it take a couple of breaths from his blow hole on top of his head and the spray, judging from distance, was about 7 to 8 feet high. He dove deeper after seemingly filling his lungs, and when he did dive below the undulations of his body (there were 2 or 3 bumps breaching the water) compressed more tightly so that I could see air between his body and the top of the water. If he had a dorsal fin it was smaller, certainly not the size of an Orca's dorsal fin. I don't recall seeing his fluke come out of
the water when he disappeared. If it did it wasn't very dramatic. I just remember that he seemed long, almost snake like, and his coloring was light brown to grey. Hope this helps! -Tom Hodie

<b>10:00 a.m. - 3-6 [<i>Bigg's/Transient</i>] orcas (including 1-2 adult males) traveling off Stuart Island</b>, from west entrance of Spieden Channel up Haro about 500m from shore of Stuart, west side of Stuart, heading north. One younger/smaller with medium size females. Maybe 1 male? seems that one of the whales's dorsal fin consistently curved/fell to left side? -Dave McGraw

Update on satellite tagged Southern Resident killer whale K33 from Dr. Brad Hanson: 21 January Update - As of 19 January <b>K33</b> (and likely the rest of K pod) had just passed<b> Heceta Head on the central Oregon coast</b>. They continued traveling north such that by the morning of the 20th they were off <b>Tillamook Head</b>. By the afternoon of the 20th they were off <b>Willapa Bay</b> where they turned back south and were again <b>off Tillamook Head this morning (21 January)</b>. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging blog

Saw a <b>grey whale today around 10:30 am</b> south sound. Southern tip of <b>Key Peninsula and Anderson Island</b>. Saw it blow a few times and tail once from about a mile or so away. That's McNeil Island in background looking north. Sorry no tail shots. Between Key Peninsula and Anderson Island. Posted it in the local Key peninsula group and a few responses said it's been in the area since at least last Sunday (January 17). -James Lewis

Update on the whereabouts of tagged killer whale K33 from Dr. Brad Hanson. On the morning of 15 January, <b>K33 </b>(and likely the rest of K pod) was southbound and had just rounded <b>Cape Blanco in southern Oregon</b>. They continued south over the next two days reaching the southernmost extent of this coastal trip, just north of <b>Cape Mendocino near Arcata, California</b>, on the afternoon of 17 January. They reversed direction and for the last two days have retraced their route and as of this morning (19 January) had just passed Heceta Head on the central Oregon coast.

New Southern Resident Killer Whale Calf Confirmed! We're excited to announce that NOAA Fisheries killer whale researchers documented <b>a new calf during a research survey with J pod </b>yesterday, January 18, 2016, in Puget Sound. Using photos taken by the researchers, the Center for Whale Research confirmed this is a new calf, designated <b>J5</b>5. The calf was in <b>close proximity to both J14 and J37</b>, so we don't know who the mother is just yet, and it may take a few encounters before we know. The calf seems to be just a few days old and in good condition.
<br/>This good news comes with some sad news, however. On the same trip we observed <b>J31, a 20 year-old female who has never successfully calved, pushing around a deceased neonate calf</b>. -NOAA-NWFSC

Orca watchers, here's our latest update on the location of tagged whale<b> K33</b>: Our previous update <b>(12 January) found K33 (and likely the rest of K pod) just north of the Columbia River</b>, traveling south. They continued their southbound trek such that by mid-day <b>on the 13th they were off Depoe Bay, Oregon</b>. On the morning of the<b> 14th they were nearing the Umpqua River</b>, an area we had followed L84 to last year during our winter cruise in late February (see 2015 blog). By this morning <b>(15 January) they had just rounded Cape Blanco in southern Oregon</b>. This southerly excursion in January is similar to what we observed in 2013 when we had K25 tagged. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC

...By <b>1455, he began an encounter with the T's (Bigg's ecotype killer whales) a mile south southeast of Kelp Reef i</b>n gray choppy seas. When Mark first spotted the whales they were travelling north in a group, but they soon commenced long dives (9 minutes) and changed direction each surfacing as if hunting for seals.  That is the situation when Ken began the encounter as Mark left to return to Victoria harbor. Read the full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter #6, including short video in Haro Strait of 8 Transients, the T30s and T124As, although one, T30, didn't make an appearance. It's also a teaching video, on how to make IDs. -Ken Balcomb, CWR

In the afternoon I joined Eagle Wing's Serengeti with Dale Mitchell and we came across a group of<b> 10 CA/U's west bound slightly east of Pillar Point</b>, 35 miles west of Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula. According to Jared Towers, " I have only seen this particular  group of CA's/U's once before in outside waters several years ago during a Fisheries and Oceans survey off Cape St. James (southern tip of Haida Gwaii).   They have never been photographed in the Salish Sea before." -Mark Malleson
<br/><i>ID Notes Re: January 8th CA Ts and others. "That group should have included<b> 8 CA transients</b>, from two groups which are have been regularly encountered seasonally off California for over 20 years - mostly in Monterey Bay, but also down in my area (near Los Angeles). They are the <b>CA140s (U105s)</b> - including a juvenile and small calf) - and female <b>CA40 (U104)</b>, with males <b>CA137 (U103) and CA163 (U106)</b>. Monterey Bay Whale Watch encountered them on 8 December 2015. There are also at least three whales with them that are not part of those CA Ts, that I do not readily recognize: the sprouter with the small nick near the tip of his narrowed dorsal fin (with CA137 in this photo), a (female?) with the narrow dorsal fin that has a tiny nick in the center, and another whale that looks like an adult female (no nicks).... The female in Mallard's image with the large single nick in the center of her dorsal fin is <b>CA140B (U105B)</b>. The female with the two large V-shaped notches in the center of her fin (looks like an "M") is <b>CA140 (U105)</b>. And the one with the new extensive rakes on the dorsal fin is <b>CA140C (U105C)</b>...I looked at naturalist Cory Mac's photos: the whales that she captured included <b>CA137, CA163 (U106), CA40 (U104), and the CA140s, Emma's (U105's) matriline</b>. " Very cool sighting! -Alisa Schulman-Janiger (California Killer Whale Project)</i>

The previous update (<b>4 January</b>) found <b>K33</b> (and presumably the rest of K pod) at the <b>western entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. On the evening of the 4th the whales headed east into the Strait of Juan De Fuca and by the <b>afternoon of the 5th were headed up Haro Strait</b> (with J pod based on the calls on the San Juan Island hydrophones). They spent the <b>6th in the southern Strait of Georgia</b> and by this morning they were in the northern Strait of Georgia, an area that we have previously seen J pod to commonly frequent. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFSC 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

We are continuing the satellite tagging project that we began in 2011 to help us understand where Southern Resident killer whales go in the winter, and thus their winter habitat use. Last Thursday afternoon, <b>31 December, we deployed a satellite-linked transmitter on an adult male, K33, in central Puget Sound</b>. The location data transmitted from this, and the previous tags we have deployed, tag will be key for NOAA Fisheries in our efforts to address the data gap in winter distribution identified in the Recovery Plan as well as provide information for the designation Critical Habitat in coastal waters. This project is a collaborative effort between the NWFSC, Cascadia Research Collective, and the University of Alaska, with supplemental funding provided by the U.S. Navy......The tag was deployed on K33 as K pod was traveling north out of Puget Sound on 31 December, 2015. By the Friday,<b> 1 January, the whales had arrived at the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. They have remained in the area <b>between the entrance to the Strait and Swiftsure Bank</b> since then. An interesting aspect of them remaining in this area for the past several days may have to do with our observation that the K14 matriline was not with the rest of K pod during our encounter. However, on Saturday, the Center for Whale Research encountered J pod, with the K 14s, as they headed south in Haro Strait and then west toward the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca - likely to rejoin with K pod. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFSC 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging
