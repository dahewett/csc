SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - <b>J17 showing peanut head</b>. -Photo by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, Dec 31, 2018

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Mon Dec 31 - Hi, Just wanted to share some photos and words from December 31st as I was out on the water that day. We went to watch the <b>T124As and the T124Ds</b> down near <b>Smith Island </b>in Washington. They were traveling slowing to the N/NW and taking very long dives - the two groups being separate at first before joining about 40 minutes later. <b>As we were heading back into Victoria Harbour we came across the southern residents (J Pod) passing through to the west.</b> In the sunset we were lucky enough to have a visit from <b>J-26(Mike) and J-39 (Mako)</b> before heading into the harbour. All current regulatory measures were taken and we did not spend much time with the southern residents. -Elizabeth Zwamborn, MSc

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Five Star Whale Watch Facebook VIDEO of <b>J pod off Victoria</b> this evening...."we had pretty much <b>all of Jpod plus L87</b> stretched across the waterfront. The two Orcas in this video are <b>J27 "Blackberry" and J47 "Notch", plus J38 Cookie</b> was nearby".
- ...The blows turned out to be from J pod and the whales were heading south on the <b>Canadian side of Haro Strait, south of Kelp Reefs</b>. Nearly all of J pod was grouped up and sleepily heading toward Cadboro Point on Vancouver Island. Not everyone was sleepy though. <b>L87 and J47 were goofing off together, as were J38, J39, and J45</b>. The <b>J16s and J46 were socializing</b> a few hundred yards to the west of the big group. To the east of the big group were <b>J17 and J53. Unfortunately, J17 has not improved </b>in health and showing a true peanuthead now. Perhaps reacting to their mother's condition, both J35 and J53 were acting mopey...

Mon Dec 31- <b>Admiralty Inlet - T124A2s &amp; T124Ds</b> - Just wanted to share some photos and words from December 31st as I was out on the water that day. We went to watch the T124As and the T124Ds down near Smith Island in Washington. They were traveling slowing to the N/NW and taking very long dives - the two groups being separate at first before joining about 40 minutes later...The photos below are of the T124A2s. All photos were taken with a telephoto lens and cropped. -All the best, Elizabeth Zwamborn MSc
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:43 - </b>They are traveling north west now, in the middle of the shipping lanes <b>between point Wilson and partridge point</b>.
Now seems to be <b>5 whales in total</b>.

Sun Dec 30 - <b>Puget Sound - T124A2s and T124Ds - 16:05 - </b>They just passed by Southworth ferry dock with research boat trailing behind. Seem to be northbound, moving quickly. -Kristen Levi

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:45 -</b> Northbound <b>Colvos almost to Southworth...About 7-8 orcas</b> with research vessel scoupin' whale poop. -Photo by Tim Ferris, Dec 30, 2018

<b>15:40 - </b>They are slowly heading North and are bunched up closer to the Kitsap side....Heading <b>towards Southworth ferry terminal</b> now.
<br/><b>15:35 - Orcas Out front Driftwood Cove</b> now, northbound. -Roxane Jackson Johnson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:32 - T124A2s and T124Ds now northbound in Colvos Passage.</b> 12/30 on the Chilkat Express was an amazing double-header with two different pods of Transient Killer Whales. We started out down south with the <b>T124A2s and T124Ds</b> as they hunted pinnipeds in Colvos Passage. We suspect that the seal(s) in question were attempting to hide under boats, including our own since this group approached us not once, but twice. Both close passes came right before some intense action and then feeding behavior shown by both the orcas and some nearby birds looking for leftovers. (Disclaimer: Both close encounters were on the orcas' terms. We and the other vessels on scene were watching from over 200 yards away when the whales turned and approached us. Engines were shut down.) Later, we met up with the T46s as they cruised south against the tide in Admiralty Inlet. <b>T124D and T124A2B, T124A2, T124D2 &amp; T124D1.</b>-Justine Buckmaster 
<br/>(<i>While Justine ID'd the pods this day, Melisa Pinnow, CWR, ID'd individuals in the photos for this report</i>) 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:29 - Orcas</b>. Directly across from <b>Cove Beach Vashon</b> hugging the west side of Colvos - still northbound - research boat following them. -Patricia Caughell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:21 - Orcas</b>. We see them! Lots of blows, maybe 5 animals? Way out on the <b>WEST side of Colvos, just south of Fern Cove</b>. There's a little 2-man research boat trailing them. -Cheryl Richmond

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:45 - Orcas</b> are swimming crazy fast, now along West side of <b>Colvos, Anderson Point, Kitsap</b>. Zoom center of water part photo. Photo shows one dorsal and research boat. I'm looking North up Colvos.
<br/><b>13:54 -</b> At Al's store in Ollalla. Pod, we think<b> 5-6, swimming North in Colvos</b>, East side of channel. Lots of spray, circular and vigorous swimming!!! Huge jumps and splashes. -Kathleen Cage

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Transient pics (below) as they were headed <b>north up Colvos Passage</b> this afternoon as seen from the shores of Vashon island. Erratic, stealthy behavior as they cris-crossed the channel, taking long dives, and popping up where you'd least suspect. Sneaky T's! I couldn't tell if it was the sunlight reflection, it's very possible, but it almost looked like the young calf in the pod had some very unusual pigmentation on the back of its body...from the dorsal to the fluke, looked very light....Would love to get some Id's if you get a chance! <b>T124A2s &amp; T124Ds Colvos Passage.</b> -Marla Smith 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:45 - Orcas </b>headed north past Lisabeula, mid channel but more towards <b>Vashon</b> side. No adult males, one babe, all females/juveniles. -Marla Smith 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:26 - Orcas.</b> Between <b>3-5 heading north in Colvos Passage</b> currently almost past Camp Sealth. -Joshua Cunningham

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:27 - Orcas</b> have committed to <b>Colvos</b>. Out of my sight now. Great breaches just before they left. Boats were a good distance behind.
<br/><b>12:20 -</b> There was milling, direction changes. Now they (orcas) look to be heading <b>towards Colvos</b>.
<br/><b>12:01 - Orcas</b> past the<b> point (Defiance)</b> traveling in a tight<b> group of 5-6</b>. Looked to be turning towards Owen Beach. Don't see any males/tall dorsals.
<br/><b>11:51 - Orcas</b> are now well<b> north of Salmon Beach</b>. Heading towards Point Defiance faster pace now.
<br/><b>11:46 - Orcas </b>are slowly trending north, close to <b>Salmon Beach side</b>. Very active, lots of splashing so I'd agree they are on a kill. Hard to count from here but I'd say <b>5+</b>.
<br/><b>11:38 - Orcas in front of Salmon Beach</b>, watching from Gig Harbor Old Ferry Landing. -Heidi Armstrong

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:45 - Orcas under the Narrows Bridge</b>, very quick sighting. Thinking they are heading north. -Andrea Walker

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:24 - Orcas</b> (3-4 of them as far as I can tell) <b>under the Narrows Bridge</b>. -Rhonda Haug

Juan de Fuca Strait - <b>T93 &amp; T97 -</b> Within minutes from our docks...we could see multiple blows from Humpback whales as we headed south after a minute or so we were fortunate enough to encounter two bull Transient Killer Whales right out <b>front of Sooke</b>. (55 year old T93 &amp; 38 year old T97 who frequently travel together) After that we visited at least 8 of the 12 Humpbacks that were in the local area...Wow what a day! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thu Dec 27 - San Juans - <b>T49A2 &amp; T65A2 ~14:00 - Orcas</b>. Just wanted to let you know that we came across two kids at<b> Salmon Bank</b>, between the green buoy and shore, at about 2:00. They were milling about Salmon Bank, right near the green buoy for quite awhile...They may be the same two that have been hanging around the islands for the last week or so, T49a2 and T65a2. One is definitely larger than the other...Attached are two pics of the same orca that we came across...the smaller one, I couldn't get a pic of.  They were milling about Salmon Bank, right near the green buoy for quite awhile. -Mariann Carrasco

Tom and Jane headed out on "Morning Star" to look for whales at 1000. At about 1150, whales were spotted in <b>Friday Harbor</b>. "Morning Star" was nearby, having searched Spieden and President Channel, and arrived on scene at about<b> 1200. T49A2 and T65A2 </b>were on the south side of the harbor, but changed direction and headed across the harbor to the north side before continuing north to Point Caution.

Thu Dec 27 - Puget Sound  -<b> T124A2s &amp; T124Ds - 16:00 - Orcas </b>were down really close to shore at Prospect point, heading towards Al's. -Matt Colby

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b>15:07 - </b>My son just saw orcas from our beach, south of Al's in <b>Olalla </b>on the Gig Harbor line heading south and then a big barge went by and the orcas went under. -Pat Devore

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:40 -</b> I could barely see the orcas from Al's market in Ollala as they headed south along Vashon. I just left there at 2:40.
<b>14:27 - orcas</b> seem to be heading South again in<b> Colvos on Vashon side</b>.
<b>14:00 - </b>I can see the whale watching boat and orca blows to the south from Al's in <b>Ollala</b>. Hoping they come North up Colvos! -Amy Bliss-Miller

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

On Saratoga in the South Sound. We got reports of orcas heading toward the Tacoma Narrows bridge from the south, so we headed there from the north. We met up with the <b>T124A2s and T124Ds just south of Colvos Passage</b>, flying north on a strong outgoing tide. The weather was nearly the complete opposite of the day before. Hardly any wind, the sun peeking from behind the clouds and water like glass. It made for some excellent photo oppurtunities, especially when the group stopped to make a kill and feed just before the end of our encounter. -Justine Buckmaster 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:27 -</b> They're entering Colvos Passage on the Gig Harbor side now. I'm counting<b> 5 or 6</b> though. Maybe more. I am the executive director of Citizens for a Healthy Bay - I was on our  -Melissa Malott, Citizens for a Healthy Bay

Wed Dec 26 - Puget Sound - <b>T124A2s &amp; T124Ds</b> on Saratoga was a very cold blustery day. Of all the days to forget my coat at home, I chose this one. My bad luck ended there, however, as just moments after leaving the Edmonds Marina we spotted a group of Transient Killer Whales hunting. It was family of 2 adult females, two juveniles, and two calves/younger juveniles. I tentatively ID'd them as the T124As but now I'm not so sure. Anyone recognize these whales? We last saw them heading south just off <b>Shilshole</b> and found them again the <b>next day near Tacoma</b>. -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>08:45 - Gray Whale </b>sighting off of <b>Bells Beach.</b> Hi Alisa, I had reported a gray whale sighting back on 10/17 that you said was overwintering and was #185. This morning we heard one heading north and ran down to the beach but it was too far off to tell if it was the same one. My husband actually heard one on Christmas Eve as well sometime in the morning. Always magical! (My neighbor who lives on the beach says there were 2 heading north. He also said a separate one was heading south? (his sighting slightly earlier, exact time unknown). -Robin Reich

This <b>gray whale</b> crossed Saratoga Passage from assumably the <b>Langley</b> area. Once it got near shoreline, it headed north to Pebble Beach, where we were lucky to be standing at the point. We first saw it at 11:00 am, and watched it travel back to Langley from Pebble. It rested there for about an hour before heading south. -Peg Boley

Sat Dec 22 - San Juans - I just saw photos from 12/22 of Ts in San Juan Channel---<b>T75Bs, T75Cs, T35As, T65A2, T65A4, and T49A2</b> for sure. Others I see but haven't yet ID'ed. Erin says <b>T38A</b> was present too....Sara Hysong Shimazu

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

..We didn't have to search too long to find whales, and many whales at that! We first came across <b>T65A2 and T49A2</b> making their way north up <b>San Juan Channel</b>, near Point Caution. The took us on a slow cruise north before we split off to visit with a larger group of orcas we'd seen heading south. It turned out to be over six more transient orcas, including T38A! Our friend and naturalist for Maya's Legacy helped identify the<b> T75Bs, T75Cs, T35As, and T65A4</b> as well. The whales took us south towards whale rocks where we visited with dozens of Steller sea lions...Island Adventures.

Sat Dec 22<b> - Puget Sound</b> - Heard<b> T46 Transient Biggs</b> orcas were near. I first saw them from <b>Brighton Beach </b>traveling about mid channel towards Hat Island and westerly...once they got close to Sandy Point, I knew then they were heading up<b> Saratoga Passage</b>. they traveled fast...saw them from Langley but they were already heading north of mid channel towards Camano. I left Langley Whale Center and headed home, but stopping at Fox Spit. they were there...but again, middish channel, a few mid channel and 2 further over towards Camano Island....then I lost them around <b>3:00pm</b>.
<br/><b>14:45 - 3 orca in between Fox Spit and Elger Bay</b> heading north towards Camano State Park...mid channel
<br/><b>13:40 - Orcas now in Saratoga Passage</b> between Sandy point and Marina veering out to middish channel. Im heading to Langley

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

12/22 on Saratoga began with reports of orcas in Friday Harbor. Weather was bad in the Straits so we planned to head there via Deception Pass. Well, we never got that far, thanks to the <b>T46s</b>! These orcas suddenly surfaced off our starboard bow. "Orca one o'clock!" I shouted when I spied <b>T46E</b>'s towering dorsal fin. We quickly realized he wasn't alone, his mother and siblings spread all across the channel, heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island...<b>T46D</b> was well behind the rest as he often is, but all 5 (<b>T46, T46D, T46E, T46F and T122</b>) were there. We left the Killer Whales just off of Clinton and went to view a <b>couple of Gray Whales near Everett</b>. Later, we chased reports of a humpback, but never found it. Some nice views and pinniped friends appeared instead! -Justine Buckmaster
<br/><b>12:30 -</b> They are still moving north spread out across the Sound, now in line with <b>Mukilteo</b> ferry landing.

<b>HUMPBACK WHALES</b> - Sat Dec 22 - Watched a <b>humpback whale between Richmond Beach, King County and Point Jefferson, Kitsap County from about 3:30-4pm</b> from my home at<b> Richmond Beach, WA</b>. Not sure if you can get an ID from these pictures, but thought it was worth a shot.  It was pretty far out (I was shooting with a 500mm lens and still had to crop), and my photos are pretty grainy because the lighting was not great and I had to use a high ISO.   
The whale was first seen swimming calmly and popping up for air every 2-3 minutes; we usually saw 2-4 breaths before a dive with tail flukes. However, once he was about 12 o'clock from our viewpoint, we saw two full breaches followed by a head lunge. Then he went back to the previous behavior. From my experience, looked like a small whale, probably a juvenile? Let me know if these pictures are helpful! -Happy holidays, Anastasia Nicolov

<b>14:30 - </b>I see "our" <b>humpback</b> out front west side of mid channel<b> between Pt. Jefferson and President Point Kingston</b> meandering north.

Thu Dec 20 - <b>Gray whale off Alki Beach, West Seattle. </b>We were sitting at our computers around <b>3:30 </b>this afternoon when looking out our window, Eilene spotted what she thought was<b> a blow from a whale</b> close in to the shore across the street. Using binoculars, we were able to confirm this and believe it was a gray whale. It stayed close to the same location for 5 - 10 minutes before swimming off toward the west along the promenade. You can see in several of the photos below how close this whale was to the beach. It would be nice if this guy hangs around in the area so we can take a look tomorrow in better weather - but hope he keeps his distance from the shore. -David &amp; Eilene Hutchinson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

12/19 on Saratoga, we were treated to a very special close encounter. We first spotted <b>two Transient Killer Whales, T65A2 and T49A2.</b> tucked in between several small islands on the east side of<b> San Juan Channel</b>. We watched from a respectful distance, engines shut down as they cruised west in 'stealth mode' likely looking for food. They were moving slowly, barely breaking the surface to breathe as they listened in all directions for seals or porpoises nearby. After a long down time, they suddenly appeared just a few yards off our bow and headed right toward us! Such a humbling moment when the ocean's apex predator decides to pay us such a close visit, seemingly just as curious about us and we are about them.
<br/><b>14:02 - (orcas) Now SE bound in San Juan Channel</b> close to Yellow Island.

A ferry from Anacortes was disembarking vehicles at the time. I saw them from the front door of the Orcas village store. There was tail-slapping, and one came at least half-out of the water doing so. Fishing? -Ken Carrasco

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Wed Dec 19 - <b>09:00 -</b> Hi, I'm brand new to the Orca Network. I live in sight of <b>Bellingham Bay</b>. I'm pretty certain I just saw <b>about 5 Orca </b>with a male in the bay. I was using a telescope from my window. I live off Eldridge in Bellingham. I thought they were seals at first, but then I saw a big fin. Can anyone confirm? The sighting was at about 9:00am December 19th...It looked like they were headed Northwest. I saw them about 1/2 way between the marina and the island. Sorry I can't be more specific...my geography is suspect at best. Pretty exciting nonetheless! -Jeremy Larsen

Perfect timing today - two large dorsal fins came into view as we arrived at Robinson Beach,<b> Mutiny Bay</b>, early this <b>afternoon</b>, with other <b>members of J and K pods</b> not far behind. The northbound whales were moving fast, and we needed to do the same to catch up with them at Bush Point. A group of six or seven orcas stopped to forage briefly with a few tail-slaps and a couple of spy-hops, while one or two others created flying foam following a breach. Against the backdrop of the snow-capped Olympic mountains, as always the sheer magnificence of the Southern Residents was a spectacular sight to behold.

At least 5 males, I think more. <b>K21 &amp; K25 </b>trailing, I believe I saw <b>J27 &amp; L87 </b>leading but can't confirm, they were pretty far out. witnessed general travel, circling around - possibly foraging, pec slaps, breach, rolling, and displaying "the full monty." Spread out from about <b>Picnic Point to Maxwelton</b> (Sightline: had whales spread all the way from <b>btwn Picnic Pt/N Lynwood area &amp; Eglon</b>, all the way past<b> Possession Pt to near Maxwelton</b>, but on Kitsap side of midchannel.

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - I spotted <b>an orca</b> (I can only confirm seeing one, but there might have been more) while on the Ferry from<b> Clinton on Whidbey over to Mukilteo</b>. I saw it very shortly after we departed. I was standing at the very front of the boat on the car deck, and there was no one else around, so I'm not sure if anyone else on the boat saw it. Date: 12-16-2018. Time: 3:07pm
Location: Just southeast of Clinton Ferry terminal. I am fairly certain it was an Orca, but can't say with 100% certainty. In memory, the dorsal fin was a very clear feature, and I feel like I was able to see black and white coloration through the surface of the water. I also think I saw two dorsal fins (two whales), but can't say for sure. It was a very brief sighting, I was so excited that I ran back to the car to get  my boyfriend and then I didn't see it again, I should have just kept my eye on it! -Fiona Booth

Found them! 12:15 pm - seeing huge splashes in the distance, watching from S. of Bush Pt, the splashes look like they are somewhere <b>between Shoreline and Carkeek Park</b>, mid-channel.

Fri Dec 14 -(Reported as humpback but image looks like <b>gray</b> - alb)
<b>16:00 -[gray] north of Hat Island marina</b> , northbound towards Camano. MORE: you know that was the first thought (gray) considering how close in it came. Was hard to tell, but didn't feed in the usual way and when it swam away it had a pronounced ridge so assumed it was hb. The exhalations were tall and lacked the heart shaped swirls, but It could have been a gray. -Lori Christopher

UNIDENTIFIED WHALES - Fri Dec 14 - <b>13:21 -</b> Just saw <b>a tail</b> come up - maybe mid channel, slightly closer to kitsap side, <b>between golden gardens and carkeek.</b>....I was wondering if it was a gray or humpback as it hung out in the same area for awhile and it was before the orcas made their way south. I didn't really see a big fin on the back either. I live in northbeach between golden gardens and carkeek and the whale was more west on the other side of the channel. -Kristen C (aka Sir Winston)

We don't know if they are Ts or SR.
<br/><b>08:42 - (orca)</b> Last report was up to 8 individuals with multiple breaches occurring. They are in the mouth of Commencement Bay... about 15 minutes ago.
<br/><b>08:00 -</b> We've spotted a male and female Orca in that area, probably Ts (<i>was <b>J pod/L87</b> - alb</i>), but please post if they are spotted again. I am being told there are 4 to 5 milling and heading north. -Brad Thiele, Northwest Environmental Consulting

Wed Dec 5 - San Juans - Marie at WSFs just called in a report from the ferry Samish: <b>4:38pm, 1 male and 1 female orca reported off Canoe Island (bet. Shaw &amp; N. Lopez)</b>, southbound. Must be some of the pod Florian reported earlier, though he thought they were residents and they only are reporting two orcas.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Just got a call at <b>11:40 am</b> from Florian Graner, he was on the ferry to Orcas Island, leaving <b>Shaw Island </b>he saw a bunch of <b>Resident orcas</b> spread out and milling between Decatour &amp; Lopez Islands, possibly heading toward Orcas Island. He was too far to get any IDs, but said there was salmon fishing going on in the area, and with the number and behavior of orcas he was sure it was Rs.

GRAY WHALES - Wed Dec 5 - <b>Gray whale in Liberty Bay in the morning and downtown Seattle in afternoon</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Dec 5 - We encountered a young <b>Humpback Whale just off of Kingston</b> who was actively feeding with a large group of California Sea Lions. After looking through the catalog, I still haven't found an ID for this whale, so any help is appreciated! We continued south after a report of orcas near Tacoma. It turned out to be J Pod! They were being extremely social and we saw several tight groups tail lobbing, spy hopping, breaching, and more! It was one of those days where I didn't take as many photos as I probably *should* have because I was just so in awe of what I was seeing. Luckily, I didn't entirely forget to snap a few shots. -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:18 - </b>Surfacing and diving repeatedly in the bay to within 160m of the ferry terminal. Initially sighted just east of Luna Park at 2:04 moving east. Making approx 6 minute dives during my observation. Last sighted near ferry terminal at 2:18. 4:06 - Alisa, I have a <b>gray whale</b> downtown approx 1000m from<b> Colman dock</b>, just dove facing NW @ 1406. -Paula von Weller

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Dec 5 - <b>09:33 - Whales in Liberty Bay in Poulsbo</b>. Looks like Grey's. They must be eating something mid-bay - they've been diving there all morning. No dorsal like an orca, but a long dark back. Tail may be dark top/white bottom. Several blows every 7-20 minutes. After some questions by ON: May be the same whale just blowing several times? I saw it first at 9:00, still blowing at 9:40. So hard to see from here. Definitely a smaller whale, but I'd have to <b>guess that it's a gray</b>. That's also the word around town. -Molly Apel

Sat Dec 1 - <b>Gray whale observed near Mannette bridge in Bremerton!</b> Spotted from our living room in Spyglass apartments! The spout caught our eye then we watched it go under, seeing its dorsal fin/ridges and fluke. The whale was moving north further into Dyes Inlet.
The sighting was shortly before 12:30. I'm confident we were seeing the dorsal ridges of a gray. Though I'm not an expert. -Wayne Tahoe

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>09:11 -</b> "We have one small solo whale, maybe <b>a minke or small grey headed north in rich passage</b>!!

It was dark on top, light on under side" -Colleen Coleman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Fri Nov 30 &amp; Sat Dec 1 - This is a<b> gray whale</b> I've never seen before (Left dorsal ridge of <b>gray whale CRC2246</b>). I attached some photos for you. It wasn't coming out of the water very high while it was feeding in the<b> Snohomish River Delta</b> around high tide (mid afternoon) on both Nov 30 2018, and Dec 1 2018.  Seen from Chilkat Express on 12/30, and MV Saratoga on 12/1. This whale appears to be small. Let me know if you find a match for it. -Thanks, Bart Rulon, Naturalist Puget Sound Express 
<br/>(<i>Photos by Bart were sent to Cascadia and Orca Network for ID purposes only so not including here. We will include in future report if received with watermark: ID notes by Alie Perez, Cascadia Research: "This animal doesn't have a CRCID but is the same individual who popped in and was seen on March 18th 2018 by Renee Beitzel."</i>)
