<h3><center>April 2013 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>April 30</b>
<br/><br/>
A report had been received early in the morning that <b>T020 &amp; T021</b> had been spotted near <b>Constance Bank</b> &amp; then again in <b>Oak Bay </b>by Mark Malleson. Despite a large search in the morning the Orcas were not picked up until later in the day by Mark south of <b>Discovery Island</b> moving North towards the Chain Islets. We left them just exiting Baines Channel heading into <b>Haro Strait around 4pm</b> yesterday. Great day on the water:)
<br/>Andrew Lees, Five Star Whale Watching
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>9:00 am</b> I watched <b>T020 and T021</b> swim northbound through <b>Oak Bay</b>....likely same animals reported at <b>7:00 AM</b> east bound north of Constance.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
<br/>*<br/>  
Just spotted <b>Grey Whale from Edmonds-Kingston ferry</b> - just off Edmonds ferry dock at <b>4:45</b>, swimming south.
<br/>Gina Vigna 
<br/><i>Note: This was about the same time a humpback (or two) were seen from that ferry, so this may have been a humpback</i>.
<br/>*<br/>
We haven't had as many this year so I was doubly excited to see <b>a gray whale</b> this morning just before <b>8 a.m.</b> In front of <b>Witter Beach (south of Langley) </b>feeding and heading south towards the ferry.
<br/>Sharon Wandler
<br/>*<br/> 
Just a note of sighting a whale by <b>Golden Gardens park</b>, headed south past Shilshole marina about <b>7pm</b>. I didn't see a dorsal fin, which made me think it was another type of whale, and it was really big. I also did not see any sign of it being part of a pod.
<br/>Elizabeth Blake
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:33 pm - Humpback</b> just swam past <b>Carkeek Park</b>, southbound, VERY close to shore. Should be passing Golden Gardens now. Calling loudly. Heard them from shore. The few times I saw a whale surface, it was smooth-backed with a clear and definite dorsal fin towards the tail. The audible call above the surface was what caused my friend and I to look and see the hump and the tail. I just watched some videos of humpbacks trumpeting above the surface and it is exactly what I heard. Maybe we have some grays out there today too, but the ones past Carkeek must have been humpbacks!
<br/>Matt Bentley
<br/>*<br/>
I also saw the same whale - at about <b>6:25</b>, from the beach at Blue Ridge (south of <b>Carkeek Park</b>, north Seattle) - very close to shore, southbound, calling, blowing. Not sure if it was a gray or humpback.
<br/>Heather Cassidy
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>5pm </b>my wife and I were at Marina Beach in <b>Edmonds </b>when we saw <b>a humpback whale</b> (possibly grey) suddenly surface not even 40 feet off the shore. It took two breaths before making a tail dive. We saw it surface and tail dive a few more times as it headed south towards Richmond Beach.
<br/>Will Crafton
<br/>*<br/>
My husband saw them from the <b>4:45 Edmonds-Kingston </b>ferry today.
<br/>Shirley Bomgaars
<br/><i>Note: It's possible these were gray whales, as reported at the same place and time.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>April 29</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>5:33 - Two Greys</b> heading through <b>Saratoga</b>. About 300ft for one and further out for the other off shore at Breezy point between the parks on Camano.
<br/>Danelle Murphy
<br/>*<br/>
<b>One or two greys</b>, halfway between the mouth of <b>Gig Harbor and Narrows bridge</b>, close to shoreline about <b>7:30pm</b> tonight.
<br/>Michele Riley Campbell
<br/><br/>
<b>April 28</b>
<br/><br/>
At approximately <b>11:50</b> we encountered <b>a juvenile humpback</b> in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, a few miles off the south-east <b>Galiano Island </b>shore. Holy wow did he/she ever impress us! After "mugging" our boat (making a series of close passes, and rolling on his/her side to look at us), a series of about 5 consecutive breaches began followed by numerous pec slaps and barrel roles. After the rush of activity, he/she began a more-or-less straight foward dive sequence in a NE direction up the Strait of Georgia. Interesting behavior indeed, perhaps playfulness on the part of this young whale? Or something else? It was one of those encounters that makes you ponder if there was some type of communication being transmitted somehow. 
<br/>Tasli Shaw
<br/>*<br/>
We were very fortunate to join in on<b> a humpback </b>sighting in<b> Georgia Strait</b>, even though it meant backtracking for us. The humpback had been located east of the midpoint of Galiano Island, and was meandering northwesterly when we arrived on scene. This individual appears to be the same humpback sighted on Apr 13, 2013 and possibly on May 11, 2012. It is not yet listed in the published HB catalogue. It appeared to be foraging along the tide lines, and some lunges were observed at the surface. After a period of foraging/feeding, the humpback began milling around, often surfacing in relatively close proximity to the stopped boats. Then, to everyone's surprise and delight, the humpback began a series of breaches, some completely clear of the water, others looking more like travelling spyhops. After at least 10 breaches, the ballet section began, with pec waves and slaps, some very graceful! The percussion section kicked in next, with a series of fluke waves and slaps, followed by a beautiful back breach. After all that activity, the humpback settled right back down to millling and travelling, and we were on our way with a load of astonished passengers and 2 very happy crew members! We deemed this to be the best-ever humpback enounter in Georgia Strait. 
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
I did not know who to send this to as it was my first time seeing a whale from land. I was at the park by the <b>Mukilteo ferry</b>, in the southern parking lot looking the water. While I was looking south, I saw the first <b>spout </b>then a tail fluke. A few mins later, I saw it again, or I assume it was the same one, the second time was closer and almost straight out from where I was standing, it was moving north. No spout, did see the back, no Dorsal fin that I could see, then fluke. Did not see it again, and only saw the one. Gray or Humpback? I am very lucky and humble to see such a marvelous creature.
<br/>Kellie Gantos
<br/><i>You probably saw a gray whale.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27</b>
<br/><br/>
My husband saw<b> a humpback</b> pass our house in<b> Olalla on Colvos passage</b> around <b>3</b>, going south close to our shoreline.
<br/>Donna Green 
<br/>*<br/>
Kenny called Orca Network to report seeing <b>4-5 orcas</b>, one with a very large dorsal fin, in<b> Winchester Bay</b> in the <b>Umpqua River in Oregon about 2:30 in the afternoon</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Despite the mild rain we encountered today, both boats were quick to find <b>transient killer whales near Trial Island</b>, who were later identified as whales <b>T20 and T21</b> of the transient orca group. The boats then went further towards San Juan Island, encountering a different group of 7 transients <b>hunting and killing a large sea lion in the middle of Haro Strait!</b> The whales were actively spy hopping and breaching as they were in a hunting frenzy around the lone sea lion.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:24  - Orcas on Lime Kiln!!!</b>

<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:45 p.m. - The T36As, T49As, T49Bs, T65As</b> a few miles <b>off of Lime Kiln</b>, killing a steller now. Approx 10 individuals.
<br/>Brittany Bowles
<br/>*<br/>
Another 'whale of a day' <b>in Saratoga Passage </b>aboard Mystic Sea today, with<b> 7 grays</b> - including a really long spyhop by #53. Those <b>ID'd were 49, 53, 56, 383, 531 and 723</b>. #44 may have been our 7th. #49 Patch revealed his namesake many times too.
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>*<br/> 
MV Mystic Sea reporting at<b> 1:38 p.m</b>. We have one unidentified <b>Gray Whale off Pebble Beach</b>. And <b>#383 off Camano Head!</b> Eagles flying overhead! Beautiful!!

One <b>gray whale seen from Clinton ferry 10 am</b> Saturday one mile SE of Hat Island heading into Saratoga Passage.
<br/>Fred Lundahl 
<br/>*<br/>
I was over by<b> Ruston Way (Tacoma)</b>. It was dusk. I heard and saw <b>a whale </b>breach the water. I was at the fishing dock. Then as I watched breached the water again somewhere close to the Red Lobster. I jumped in my truck drove up to the parking lot just before road turns to go up to Ruston. I looked back towards the flats and saw it again. This time I saw that magnificent tail. Then just past the parking lot it came up and I saw a complete view of its side. There was no white at all. It was not huge but then it was definitely bigger than any porpoise I have ever seen. The last time I saw it was as it came up near the new condos where the asarco stack was. When I got in my truck to leave it was<b> 9:10 pm.</b> What an amazing sight! I didn't even know they came into Commencement bay.
<br/>Sonia Pederson
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>a whale off Tahlequah</b> (south end of Vashon Island) by the ferry dock about <b>4 PM</b>, heading east toward Maury Island. (could this be the Humpback that was in Elliott Bay the day before?)
<br/>Janice Stixrud
<br/>*<br/>
I saw <b>a whale</b> close to shore at low tide at<b> Edmonds beach</b>. I heard the spout and looked over just to see it go back down. It was heading south at about <b>12:30-1:00 pm</b>.
<br/>Judie McGee Menz 
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>gray whale </b>was reported feeding off <b>Tacoma/Commencement Bay at noon</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26</b>
<br/><br/>
We were lucky enough to catch up with <b>T20 and T21 in the Strait of Georgia </b>today. At<b> 3 PM</b> they were <b>3 miles NE of the Belle Chain Islets</b>, heading towards Active Pass. It turned out to be a beautiful afternoon.

<br/>*<br/> 
MV Mystic Sea reporting at<b> 3:30 p.m.</b> We are enjoying <b>at least five Gray Whales off to the east of Gedney (Hat Island)</b>. Able to identify <b>Patch and Dubnuk</b>. Lots of blows and rolls! We received reports from MV Whaler that earlier this afternoon, at <b>2:00, a Gray Whale was seen in a full breach!</b> A spectacular day!
<br/>Kristen Kogler
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Five grey whales</b> seen today, including Patch and Dubnuck. Whales were fairly 'surface' and didn't display their tail flukes or too much of themselves as they were either travelling steadily or feeding in shallow water. But once again wonderful whale watching conditions, warm, sunny, calm, as "Mystic Sea" cruised past Gedney (Hat) Island.
<br/>Sandra Pollard
<br/>*<br/> 
Great <b>gray whale </b>show breaching, flukes and spy hopping <b>off Hat Is</b>. Today.
<br/>Deception Pass Tours
<br/>*<br/> 
Errol reported an <b>unknown type of whale was seen off Alki Beach</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
I was at <b>Faye Bainbridge Park</b> this afternoon and thought I saw <b>a large whale</b>, but I didn't see a spout and I didn't see it again - now I'm wondering if I saw the humpback.
<br/>Connie Bickerton 
<br/>*<br/> 
Yep, the Friday night ferry ride home was amazing. Just as the Bremerton ferry was about to dock at <b>5:20pm in Seattle</b>, I looked out to the north from the car deck and saw a huge black whale surfacing about 20 yards away from the docked BI ferry. It was headed north and I didn't see it surface again. I wasn't sure <b>it was a humpback</b> until I found these comments. A really great way to start the weekend.
<br/>Patrick Kern 
<br/>*<br/>
We've received <b>two reports of a Humpback whale in Elliott Bay </b>this <b>evening </b>- boaters, please beware and keep on the lookout for this whale, staying at least 100 yards away - thanks!
<br/>First report was from Stephanie Raymond on board the Victoria Clipper, at <b>5 pm,</b> reporting the <b>Humpback heading NE in Elliott Bay</b>, across from the Duwamish Head marker.
<br/>Then we received a report from Maya Holstein at WA State Ferries, reporting a<b> Humpback whale at 5:33 pm, at Pier 52, Coleman Dock</b>, headed south.
<br/>*<br/>
The Water Taxi crew said they saw <b>a humpback between 5-6pm</b> and that it was heading out of <b>Elliot Bay past Duwamish Head</b>.

Hi from <b>South Africa</b>. A small group and myself went out Saturday to see how the sarine run was coming along off our shore in Port Elizabeth when we came upon <b>7 Orca hunting Dolphin</b>, quite a show. I got in the water after they were done and noticed one of the Orca was missing a Pectoral fin (and a dorsal fin). It also had teeth marks just before the tail. I was wondering what could be the cause? I have video on my facebook page (shared on the Orca Network facebook page) that shows this. I would love some input.

Was out working on the hillside today and at about <b>1400 hrs, 2 adult greys swam by</b>, just off the buoy line, swimming towards the head of Port Susan. We live on the beach at Sunny Shores, <b>approximately 2 miles south of Kayak Point</b>. They were swimming together in the shallows. This is the 3rd such sighting in the last week or so where we have seen them within 150' or so from the shore in relatively shallow water.

A <b>Risso's dolphin</b> was spotted in the South Sound from a boat, <b>between Fox and McNeil islands</b>.

<br/><br/>
<b>April 24</b>
<br/><br/>
I just observed <b>4 orcas heading west in Haro Strait (7:10 pm)</b>, along the south side of <b>Saturna</b>. 3 adults (appear to be 2 males, 1 female), one juvenile. The male has a very tall, narrowish dorsal fin that is slightly rippled. The youngster was travelling with this male. The other male and female were travelling together. They appeared to be swimming hard, slow and deliberate.
<br/>Maureen Welton
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:30 pm - 4-5 grays feeding now Snohomish delta</b>.

<br/><br/>
<b>April 23</b>
<br/><br/>
Finally get to see <b>a whale </b>from my office at the Norwester at <b>Naval Air Station Whidbey Island</b>. It was at<b> 3PM</b> (23 Apr) and appeared to be a single whale of some good size but <b>not a grey whale</b>. It was a good <b>2/3 of the way between Whidbey and Lopez island </b>and there appeared to be a Coast Guard ship lingering in the shipping straits, perhaps enjoying a look at the activity as well? I saw no fin that would indicate it was an Orca whale but it had some clear white spots on black body like an Orca?  It did show one smaller dorsal during one of the breeches. It had made a kill or there was some confluence of fish on the surface such that it drew gulls and other sea birds to the spot. From a distance one could see the birds teeming and the whale coming 1-3 feet out of the water over a period of some 20 minutes then it moved in a Northerly direction, roughly in the shipping channel. I hope more to come!

We had a <b>single large Orca </b>surface once about 20' away from the boat about <b>9pm</b> Wednesday. It was eastbound off <b>Chain Islands (Oak Bay, Victoria)</b>. It's hard to see black whales at night!
<br/>Keith Provan
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>10-12 orcas </b>together traveling through <b>Spieden Channel</b> yesterday, heading north at about <b>1:00pm</b>. We saw a female and her 2 offspring -- one baby-- who came close by as we floated. The others we saw from about 300 yds away about 20 min prior. This was between Spieden Island and Flat Rock Island. Amazing!

<br/><br/>
We were with <b>T49Bs and T65As </b>again and they were in the midst of a seal banquet near <b>Moresby Island</b>. We saw them pick off at least 2 or 3 while we were there midday - lots of activity and excitement, and scrambling seals! The whales were rolling, tail slapping and charging all over the place. They were circling the area but heading north as we left. In a couple shots you can see one of the kills and another has a close crop of T49B with a piece of blubber in her mouth as she surfaces.
<br/>-Andy Scheffler, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Two Orcas</b> slowly southbound in <b>Trincomali channel</b> between Galiano island and the Secretaties at <b>7:30</b>.
<br/>Karen Steve Smith
<br/>*<br/> 
We encountered the <b>T49Bs and T65As</b> foraging near Sheep Island (south of <b>Moresby Island</b> in the Gulf Islands) where many of the rocks were covered in harbor seals. <b>T49A2</b> was in the mix. I do not have any positive IDs on any other T49As though. We watched the orcas expertly patrol close to the rocks and we saw the water turn red with seal blood once, though I believe they made two kills during our observation of them. The two youngest in the group, <b>T49B2 and T65A4</b>, broke away from the others to play (with seal scraps perhaps?) at one point, but quickly rejoined the group and the 7 of them continued on their way toward the Comet/Gooch Island area. So fabulous!

Perfect whale watching conditions from "Mystic Sea" today, no rain, no wind, calm seas and whales off<b> Gedney (Hat) Island, Sandy Point (Langley) and Pebble Beach, Camano Island</b>, including<b> #49 Patch</b> cruising past Gedney with a friend. <b>#22 and #723 </b>were spotted later off Camano (thank you Pam, Marilyn, Alisa and Ed for the excellent photos and help with ID). A memorable day in the company of our leviathan friends with a whiff of whale breath thrown in for good measure...
<br/>Sandra Pollard
<br/>*<br/>  
On the <b>10 am ferry to Clinton</b>, Ed spotted a whale in the ferry lanes heading northeast towards Hat/Gedney Island. Once underway aboard the Mystic Sea out of Langley, at <b>11:40 I spotted a gray whale blow </b>directionally towards <b>Tulalip Bay</b>. As we motored towards him Ed and I (as well as Pam, Marilyn, and others) continued to see his blows and back as he surfaced and dived. Once in that area the whale never surfaced there again so we turned towards Hat/Gedney Island where blows could be seen from afar. We headed that way and at <b>12:15 we encountered gray whales #21 and #22 about 1 mile northwest of Hat Island</b>. We stayed with these two for about an hour as they swam together circling our drifting boat in 500 foot waters (at times we thought there were three whales but we cannot find evidence in photo's or video).      
<br/>We moved south over to the northwest tip of Hat where Capt. Monty had seen a whale feeding near shore. It was there we met up with <b>#49 Patch</b> with his iconic "patch" marking and <b>#723 </b>who by then were traveling together southeast along the bottom of Hat. We left those two about <b>1:30-1:45 </b>and headed north back towards Camano head.
Approaching Saratoga Passage, in the bay north of Pebble Beach (Camano Island) we could see blows ahead and at<b> 2:05 we once again encountered #21 and #22</b> traveling northbound in the passage. Throughout the day we were treated to much beauty and the added beauty of the diving fluke of #22 on about 6 occasions.   
<br/>A most memorable day in our magical northwest waters in the company of whales and friends. Wonderful and interesting to think of their relationships and how long many of these whales have been traveling together.

I love days that go like this: "We don't have any orca reports..." 5 minutes off the dock, "Ooo, we have an orca report! Oh...they are really far away... But WAIT they are coming our way..." 10 minutes later, "Ah darn, they are going the wrong direction. Too far away..." 5 minutes later, "Oh look! Seals!" 5 minutes later, "Oooo! Another orca report and they are coming our direction!!! Oh...but they are really far away..." Meanwhile, pedal to the metal...gonna try to make it! 30 minutes later- shoot through <b>Active Pass</b>, but still 5 miles from orcas... "Hey wait a second...what was THAT?? Did you see that???! I saw that! <b>ORCAS</b>!!!!!!!" Watch orcas for 10 minutes, and then look over shoulder to see <b>MORE ORCAS!</b> And then <b>ANOTHER group of orcas!</b> Well...holy sh*t *smiles all around* :)
(I believe the final count of transient orcas in the area today was <b>28?? We had the T18's, T65A's, and T49A's </b>[I think] - the usual suspects, but very glad to see them!)

We just saw what we think is a whale in <b>between Hope and Steamboat Island in the Puget Sound (north end of Saratoga Passage)</b>. Seemed to big for a dolphin.

<br/><br/>
Around <b>noon </b>I saw <b>4 to 5 orcas</b> in front of our cabin on <b>Keats island </b>(about 15 miles NW of Vancouver BC) coming out of Collingwood Channel into Barfleur Passage. There was a bigger orca fin a distance away and it stayed closer to the Paisley islands. The rest of them headed over to Keats island and spent some time in a cove near Pebble Beach where they appeared to be eating. There was <b>a baby orca among them</b>. I was able to see the light patch behind the fin of one and also the fluke of one when it dove into the water. They frolicked for a while between Preston island and Keats island. The distant orca had a less curvy tail. 
Last year we saw three orcas that passed right in front of our cabin.

2 April update - Since the morning of 28 March when K25 was near the Point Grenville area the whales moved north to the head of the Quinault Canyon. By 29 March the whales had turned south and were on the continental shelf break to the west of Gray's Harbor. The whales continued south and were southwest of the Astoria Canyon on 30 March. The whales then traveled to the east near the entrance of the Columbia River and by 31 March they were near the entrance of Grays Harbor. The whales again turned south and were in the Astoria Canyon on 1 April. The whales then turned east and then north traveling just offshore of the entrance to the Columbia River and were just northwest of Cape Disappointment on the morning of 2 April.
