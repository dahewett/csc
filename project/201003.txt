<b>March, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
There have been <b>one or two grays</b> in the northeast part of <b>Port Susan almost every day for the past month or so</b>. Once I saw Patch (#49).
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Point 
<br/><br/>
<b>March 31, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
We saw at least two whales spouting and rolling in <b>Liberty Bay</b> between the Poulsbo marina and the Yacht Club marina. We live on Fjord Drive near Oyster Plant Park and saw them about 3-4 times for about an hour starting at <b>6 pm</b>. Many people were lined up along Fjord Drive and on the docks to watch them. Two people were in kayaks and were very close when one surfaced just south of the Yacht Club Marina. They looked like <b>Grays</b>, one large and one small, perhaps a mother and calf. About 7 pm, just before it got dark, I observed one of the whales surfacing and heading toward the head of the bay.
<br/>Annette Franzen, Project Manager, Sealaska Environmental Services, Forwarded to Orca Network by Chris Dunagan, Kitsap Sun 
<br/>*<br/>
Just a distant sighting, here, at <b>Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Isl)</b>. A couple of spouts, from several hundred yards out; ending, in a dive with a fluke/tail [good bye]. Then, gone. 
<br/>Robert Stonefelt Oak Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:05 PM</b>, near Victor Hotel off the <b>Victoria Waterfront</b>. The deep sea freighter ran right through the middle of a pod of <b>15 or so transients Orcas</b>, never slowing or changing course. None of the Orcas retreated nor seemed disturbed, or changed course either. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/> 
My wife and I spotted <b>two Orca whales</b> West of <b>Harstene Island</b>, just South of Jerrel cove in <b>So. Puget Sound</b> at ~ <b>5:20 PM</b>.. They were headed South toward the bridge to Harstene. They submerged and surfaced about 12 times, then submerged and did not resurface about 1000 yards North of the bridge. Shortly after, we spotted several Orca heading North up Pickering Passage. I think there were three or four. The time was a little after <b>6:00 PM</b>.
<br/>David Callan 
<br/>*<br/>
Donna Fisher called from Stretch Island in <b>Case Inlet, between Harstene Island and Key Peninsula</b>, to report <b>5 orcas</b> heading north, between <b>7:30 and 7:45 AM</b> today. She said there were 2 adults and 3 calves. She called back at <b>10:30</b> to say they were now headed west near Harstene Island, and that it looked like there were <b>six orcas</b>.
<br/>*<br/> 
Ken Balcomb called at <b>5 pm</b> from the ferry Coho en route from <b>Victoria to Port Angeles</b>, with a report of <b>15-20 transients</b>, heading east between Race Rocks and Trial Island. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transients </b>were heard early in the morning so our passengers gathered earlier than planned and we headed out at <b>10:00 AM</b>. With the help of Mark Malleson, we found a large group of Transient Orcas about <b>6 miles southeast of Victoria</b>. Calm seas, amazing skies, and playful Orcas. We left them about 7 miles West of Victoria. Not a bad day.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
The day began with hearing <b>Transient calls</b> at about <b>6:15 a.m.</b> on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b> (NW San Juan Island) I spotted them coming south in Haro Strait, near <b>Kelp Reef</b> marker at <b>6:55 a.m</b>. and followed them (via binocs) all the way down Discovery Island and until they went out of view. I went out with Capt. Jim Maya at 10 and with direction from Mark Malleson we found the Ts - apx 15 animals - south of Discovery Island - as in the morning they were moving slowly and changing direction. There appeared to be a new calf. With the new calf and mom was a juvenile - brother or sister perhaps. The whales slowly continued west in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> when we left. 
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Listening to whales on <b>Orcasound </b>hydrophone right now. <b>6:50 AM.</b>
<br/>Caprice Hinshaw Kutz (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Hearing <b>Orca calls 6:21 am</b> Pacific time on the <b>Orcasound </b>hydrophone.
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Florida 
<br/>*<br/>
Karen of Camano Island called to report <b>2 Gray whales</b>, 1 large and 1 small, feeding off <b>Mabana Beach, SW Camano Island</b> at <b>5:30 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>5:00 this afternoon</b>, we were looking across <b>Saratoga Passage</b> at Sandy Point, where two or three <b>[gray] whales</b> looked to be feeding or slowly moving south. As we were watching them, another large grey appeared moving south in front of our bank, about 100 yards out. He appeared out of nowhere, as we did not hear him approach with blows. He blew twice, then disappeared to the south, toward Hat Island. He seem to be holding his breath for long distances; otherwise we would have heard him coming.
<br/>Peg Boley, South Camano
<br/>*<br/>
Veronica von Allworden called at <b>9:44 am</b> to report <b>a Gray whale</b> observed from the <b>Clinton/Mukilteo ferry</b>, closer to Mukilteo and heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island. Later updates: One more report today, Eric was flying at <b>3:40 pm</b> and spotted <b>three gray whales</b> north of <b>Camano Point</b> at the entrance to Port Susan. The whales were not feeding but were headed towards Everett. Eric just returned from his flight. At <b>5:15 PM</b>, he flew near the big marker west of Everett and northeast of <b>Hat Island</b>. All three whales that he saw earlier were there and all three were feeding in the shallow water on the big sand shoals.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>A lone gray</b> passed by our home, between <b>Polnell shores and Mariner's Cove</b>, today, at about <b>4:30 pm</b>. It rolled onto its side at one point, showing its pectoral fin, presumably feeding, but after that one snack, continued on to the Mariner's Cove neighborhood (NE?) at a steady cruise. 
<br/>Catherine Beard, Oak Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
I headed to Hill Road, (S of <b>Ebey's Landing, W/Central Coupeville</b>) and SAW the <b>[gray] whale</b> underwater, right in front of me (around <b>1 pm</b>). He did not show much of himself, was traveling approx 3-4 mph I estimated, and I only saw him surface this one time.
<br/>Jill Hein, Coupeville, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Christina Baldwin called at <b>12:35 pm</b> to report a juvenile <b>Gray whale</b> 200' offshore of <b>Ebey's Landing</b>, W/Central Coupeville, heading south. She called about 20 minutes later to say it had stopped traveling south and was still hanging around Ebey's Landing.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>~12:30 pm</b> - I see 'em !!!! (<b>Gray whales</b>, we presume?) <b>Saratoga Passage</b> - west Camano Cama Beach area!!!
<br/>Judy C Lervold-Kielhamer (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Ron Selvige of Poulsbo called to report a <b>Gray whale</b> in <b>Liberty Bay</b>, 50 yards south of the commercial marina in <b>Poulsbo </b>at <b>9:30 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Paula Rounds of Oak Harbor called to report <b>2 Gray whales</b> off <b>Polnell Pt., NE Whidbey Island</b>, making big circles and feeding close to shore in the bay at <b>9:20 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Nancy Zaretzke of <b>Greenbank </b>called to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> headed north in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, outside the bouys off Hidden Beach, Greenbank, SE Whidbey Island at <b>8:25 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 pm</b> - a <b>grey whale</b> feeding between <b>Ebey's Landing and Pt. Partridge</b> (W/Central Whidbey Isl) ~ 1/4 mile out.
<br/>Al Luneman, Coupeville, Whidbey Island
<br/><br/>
<b>March 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
We have a beach house on <b>Elger Bay on Camano Island</b>. Unsure of exact amount, but it appeared to be <b>three Gray whales</b> seen on both Monday and Tuesday. They appeared to be slowly moving East. We are pretty sure they were feeding, as they were close to the beach and it looked like they were swimming on their side, with their (arm) flippers out of the water. We think they were digging up the sand in order to find food.
<br/>Kris Wehmeyer and Family, Camano Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
After hearing that there were <b>Orcas in Penn Cove</b>, we went to the wharf at Coupeville and spotted them moving east out of Penn Cove about <b>7:30pm</b>. The orcas were closer to the north side of the Cove. When we first spotted them, they were close to Monroe Landing.
<br/>Val Hillers, Cooupeville, Whidbey Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:30 PM</b> - <b>Two Ocras</b> came through <b>Penn Cove, Coupeville</b>. A large and a small. Two seals were avoiding them as they came close to the shore on the Scenic Heights side. 
<br/>Theresa Gonsalves (via facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>afternoon </b>'Goldwing' tour was planned to take Brett and I way to the Northeast of Victoria to Pt. Doughty (Northwest corner of Orcas Island). We had recent information that Ken Balcomb was on scene with a group of Transients which were making a kill on a Sea Lion. However, as we were transiting through Oak Bay, one of the Prince of Whale zodiacs picked up a small <b>Gray Whale</b> Westbound in <b>Enterprise Channel</b>. We spent about 20 minutes sitting with our engines off as the whale swam circles all around us, which was very curious behaviour to see in such a busy channel. After our short visit with the curious little Gray Whale, we got a call that <b>4 Transients</b> were picked up just a few miles South of our location. Upon arrival we found the <b>T-30's</b> !!! They were very spread out and headed West at about 5 knots. We followed these animals for about half an hour towards <b>Albert Hd.</b> before we broke off and headed out to Race Rocks.
<br/>Jeff Lamarche, Captain "Goldwing", Eagle Wing Tours, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Saw the <b>Killer Whales</b> about <b>3 PM</b> in the same spot for several minutes on the surface going back and forth, from Hill Street on <b>Camano Island</b>. 2 - 3 whales from what we could tell. Didn't see any Gray Whales. 
<br/>Justin Donnelson, Camano Island, WA (via facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
The guy with the photos was actually the one who spotted the male <b>Transient orca</b> off <b>Pt. Wilson</b> yesterday morning (3/29) - he pointed it out to Bob. His photos are on Flickr. Some great shots taken in <b>Saratoga Passage off Canamo Head</b> of the male, and a couple of the eldest gray on her side.
<br/>Erick Peirson, the Olympus, Pt. Townsend, WA
<br/><i>Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research looked at these photos and identified the Transients as the T18s.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Jan Graham called to report <b>a small pod of orcas</b> in <b>Penn Cove, Coupeville</b> - they had gone into Penn Cove until they were ~400 yards from the Capt. Whidbey Inn, and at <b>7:10 pm</b> were heading toward the Coupeville Wharf and out of the Cove.
<br/>*<br/>
Jill Hein of Coupeville called to relay a report from John Howard, who saw <b>4 orcas</b> in <b>Penn Cove</b>, near Coupeville, Whidbey Island, WA this <b>evening</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We woke up to the sight of <b>six or seven transients</b> (?) off of Parker Reef on the <b>north side of Orcas Island</b> feeding and drifting slowly with the tide. Looked like <b>maybe six or seven orca</b> including three juveniles, too far off for getting any ID's.
<br/>A follow up on the transients I saw this morning: We found them on our trip today pretty close to where they earlier. There appears to be a new born in the group but I kept my distance and really couldn't get a good ID on any of them. Ken Balcomb took some photos to ID when he gets back to the Center. We did notice they had made a Steller sea lion kill and were in the process of finishing it off.
<br/>Tom Averna, Deer Harbor Charters, Orcas Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 Transient's</b> + a newborn in <b>Presidents Channel (San Juan Islands)</b> feeding on a sealion! 
<br/>Matt Stolmeier (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
Ann Casey and Carol Plunkett of Freeland called Orca Network to report a sighting of <b>several orcas</b> from the <b>Clinton/Mukilteo ferry</b> at <b>11:09 am</b>. The orcas were north of the ferry lanes, heading N, &amp; included 1 adult male and a small one.
<br/>*<br/>
Sounds like <b>Transients </b>on Lime Kiln Hydrophone (posted ~7 am PST). hopefully my recordings will be OK. 
<br/>Gina West (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson on the Olympus called Orca Network at <b>12:05 pm</b> to report a small <b>pod of orcas</b> off the south tip of <b>Camano Island</b>. It appeared as if they were headed north up the west side of Camano in Saratoga Passage. He called a few minutes later saying they also had <b>several Gray whales in the area</b>, very close to where the Orcas were.
At <b>12:15 pm</b>, he called to report that the orcas (1 male, 2 females and a juvenile) had approached the Gray whales (2 adults &amp; a smaller one). The adult male orca made contact with one of the adult Gray whales - he said the Grays got in a defensive position, &amp; rolled over a bit, and the orcas circled and the water roiled for awhile, but after about a minute the encounter ended and the orcas continued heading NW up Saratoga Passage at a fast pace. Whew!! He left them at <b>1:30 pm</b> as they continued north, mid-channel in Saratoga Passage, between Greenbank on Whidbey &amp; Elger Bay on Camano. 
<br/><i>We tried to find them again a bit later but didn't see them, so not sure what direction they went from there. 
Chris Dunagan of the Kitsap Sun interviewed Erick for his blog, Watching our Water Ways - click here to read more about this interesting encounter!</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 grays</b> heading north in front of <b>Tulalip Shores in Marysville Wa</b>. 20 yards off shore, rolling and eating/playing - <b>5:00pm</b>.. They've been here for 10 minutes. We see them daily so this must be a favorite eating spot. I'll try to upload the video I took later. Such beautiful creatures! 
<br/>Tamra Nelson (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/> 
We went to look for the <b>orcas </b>in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, which we didn't see, but we did see <b>1 Gray whale</b> NW of <b>East Pt, Whidbey Island</b>, heading toward Baby Island &amp; into the entrance of Holmes Harbor, at <b>3:25 pm</b>.
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Another "gray" day at Mariners Cove. <b>Single gray whale</b>, with little/no appetite quickly passed through at <b>10:15 AM</b>; this morning. Heading, SW. Low tide was around noon. Same? gray, with appetite; was back feeding at <b>3:30 PM</b> this afternoon. Gradually, heading SW towards Polnell Pt. Again, close to shore, within 100 feet or so. 
<br/>Robert Stonefelt Oak Harbor 
<br/><br/>
<b>March 29, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Gary Kennedy called to alert me. <b>6:15 to ~ 6:20pm</b>, <b>3 orcas</b> off Gary's house, North Beach, <b>Pt. Townsend, WA</b>, ~ ¼ mile from public access beach heading very slowly westward toward Protection Island. 2 were swimming together, one was smaller than the other. 3rd whale small distance away. ~ 100 ft off shore. Lots of birds and 2 sea lions present in H2O when I first saw them. Did not see sea lions again until after orcas gone. Obviously large school of fish due to activity on the water. Whales kept surfacing and diving. Saw their fins, back and occasionally tail as dove.
<br/>Meredith Lowry, Port Townsend, WA
<br/>*<br/>
We have a beach house on <b>Elger Bay on Camano Island</b>. Unsure of exact amount, but it appeared to be <b>three Gray whales</b> seen on both Monday and Tuesday. Not far off the beach, in Elger Bay, on Camano Island, Washington (Lat 48 degrees, 7.8 minutes North; Long 122 degrees, 28.2 minutes West). They appeared to be slowly moving East. We are pretty sure they were feeding, as they were close to the beach and it looked like they were swimming on their side, with their (arm) flippers out of the water. We think they were digging up the sand in order to find food.
<br/>Kris Wehmeyer and Family, Camano Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
I had <b>3 orca's</b> off shore by my house at <b>6:15 pm</b>. They were fishing or playing, spent ~ 10 mins surfacing and diving just off North Beach in <b>Port Townsend</b>. One was smaller than the others, the small one stayed by one of the larger ones, 3rd was usually off to the side. 
<br/>Meredith Lowry 
<br/>*<br/>
After getting the report of <b>a Gray whale</b> off <b>Hidden Beach</b> last night, we went down to find it. We watched from around <b>6:30 - 7 pm</b> - it had headed S, then N. again - but we finally spotted it close to shore just N. of Hidden Beach, Greenbank, then mid-channel, and then heading back south down Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Whale </b>spout in <b>Clinton-Mukilteo Ferry Channel</b>, <b>4:00pm</b>.
<br/>Toni Ferrell (via facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Jerry Schimmie of Freeland, Whidbey Island, called to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> off <b>Bush Pt.</b> at <b>6:55 pm</b>, heading north slowly about 1/3 of the way across Admiralty Inlet.
<br/>*<br/>
After, last night's lengthy meal, <b>a gray</b> came by at <b>3:15 PM</b> this afternoon, for another visit. Had a brief snack out front, here, at 
<b>Mariners Cove</b>. Then, watched, a trail of spouts; as it quickly cruised N.E. towards, Strawberry Point, under a full head of steam.
<br/>Robert Stonefelt, <b>Oak Harbor</b>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 Orca</b> sighted off of Berry Point Road on <b>Gabriola Island</b> (BC Gulf Islands) in front of the Surf Lodge (49.206888W, -123.8345N approximately), traveling north at around <b>2:00 pm</b>.
<br/>Lee Ker 
<br/>*<br/>
Bob Whitney of Pt. Townsend, WA called Orca Network at <b>10:51 am,</b> he was watching <b>1 male Orca</b> - it was about 300 meters off <b>Pt. Wilson, NW of Pt. Townsend</b>, heading SE toward Marrowstone Island (&amp; the Steller sea lion haulout!). 
<br/>*<br/>
Nancy Zaretzke of Greenbank, Whidbey Island called at <b>6:05 pm</b> to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> feeding close in at <b>Hidden Beach</b>, Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>*<br/>
<b>Whale </b>spout in <b>Clinton-Mukilteo Ferry Channel</b>, <b>4:00 pm</b>.
<br/>Toni Ferrell (via facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
Glanced out our window about <b>12:45 PM</b> today and was surprised to see whale spouts among the wind and waves. I spent half an hour watching <b>3 grays</b> feeding out a ways off the drop-off south of <b>Mabana (SW Camano Isl)</b>. They slowly moved south.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Don from Freeland, Whidbey Island, called to report <b>2 Gray whales</b> in <b>Holmes Harbor</b> at<b> 7 am</b> this morning, northbound past Beverly Beach.
<br/><br/>
<b>March 28, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
I heard about a juvenile <b>gray </b>in <b>Liberty Bay</b> the weekend before Easter. Our friends at Liberty Bay Marina said it surfaced and blew not far from the outer float at the marina, heading slightly north up into the bay.
<br/>Pamela 
<br/>*<br/>
Don from Freeland, Whidbey Island, called to report <b>2 Gray whales</b> in <b>Holmes Harbor</b> at <b>1800</b>.

It was another full on dinner, in rough seas; at <b>Mariners Cove [N.E. Whidbey]</b> this evening for <b>a single gray whale</b>. Gray, must like what's on the menu here. No reservations required for this VIP guest. We saw neighbor's guest taking pictures and thought it was about the big waves coming in; until we saw spouts. Very, very close into shore. Closest, I have ever seen [50/60 TO 75 MAX FEET OFFSHORE] which is surprising due to rough seas. You would think gray would keep further away from shore, due to large/choppy forceful waves pushing it in, towards shore. We saw feeding begin before <b>7PM</b> [probably, not at the start of its feeding] and last spouts seen heading SW towards <b>Polnell Pt. at 7:45 PM</b>, feeding the entire time.
<br/>Rather than opine, here are questions that came to mind, during gray's visit.
<br/>1) Lengthy feed in rough seas. Could large waves help stir up sand/assist and make it easier [not more difficult] for gray to swirl around/feed on the ghost/sand shrimp?
<br/>2) Why so close to shore in rough seas? Is there a type of back eddy or pushing up wave action; that can assist and/or make whale, more buoyant? Kinda, opposite to what one might think; as, in, concern of large waves pushing gray onto shore and potential beaching. BOTTOMLINE, is that gray didn't appear to have any problem whatsoever, with stormy churning waters.

A <b>single grey whale</b> was seen from <b>Possession Point State Park</b>, at aproximately <b>7pm</b>, traveling north. We watched it for quite a distance, it would surface 3-4 times in a row then travel quite a ways before surfacing again. The blow sound was quite loud.

Went looking for the <b>Gray </b>this morning and I was not disappointed. At <b>9:15 am</b> from <b>Carkeek Park</b> ( N Seattle) I could spot it's spray down south off the point at Golden Garden's. I talked with a fisherman who had seen the Gray in the inlet between the two parks throughout the morning, 50 yards off shore. He said he also saw a dorsal fin (so maybe an orca is back. ? ) and harbor seal popped up near him as well. I headed to and arrived at Golden Garden's about <b>9:45</b> and YEAH!!! spotted the Gray just off the north point, about 100 yards off shore, Big and Beautiful !!! At first it was headed slowly in a northeast direction, but mostly it was circling and milling around the same general area, surfacing about every 2-4 minutes. I watched it until 11:00 am at which time it was slowly headed in a southwesterly direction near that green bouy. The picture below is from Golden Garden's

We spotted <b>one gray whale</b> off Discovery Park's South Beach (just east of West Point) in <b>Seattle</b>. We watched it for probably twenty minutes and it didn't travel far at all, but blew several times and we were able to see some mottled coloring and lack of a dorsal fin. This was at about <b>3:30 pm</b>, but the whale had been reported by some visitors a little bit prior to this time.

<br/><i>Our guess would be a Gray whale since there were other sightings and photos of a Gray off W. Seattle yesterday. Often when a Gray is feeding, only its pectoral fin &amp; fluke tip are visible and can sometimes be confused with a dorsal fin.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>1 p.m</b>. we observed <b>a single small Gray whale</b> close to shore at <b>Discovery Park's North Beach</b>. His back, mottled black and gray, broke the surface several times. He then disappeared underwater, emerging three or four minutes later spouting and heading north in the direction of Shilshole Marina. This is probably the same small Gray reported near Carkeek Park on March 22 and 26.

Well our <b>gray whales</b> returned for a day visit. Two, mother and calf were sighted in the channel of <b>Penn Cove</b> just off Scenic Heights Road about 500 feet off shore. Feeding and playing westbound towards the mussel farm. What a sight, as this was my first sighting ever. About an hour later, they returned coming back through (no outlet) and I waited. I did take some pictures but used my SLR camera and will have to take them in to be developed. I am so thrilled they came during the day time. Mom is big but the calf is much smaller and they came up for air about every 10 minutes.

We had a whale around <b>11:45 am</b> around the same area - off the South Beach of <b>Discovery Park</b>. Unfortunately, I was unable to get a good look at this whale and don't know what kind it was for sure. It was definitely 20 feet or larger and reports from visitors and park volunteers have varied on whether there was a dorsal fin or not.

Lori Willson called to report <b>one Gray whale</b> off W. Seattle at 1:30 pm, swimming N. She then sent this report:
Wow! What a joyous day here on the shores of West Seattle. I just got back after spending about 3 hours watching the gray. I first saw it just south of Emma Schmitz Memorial Viewpoint. It slowly made its way north, stopping and staying in one area from time to time, before moving on again. It generally stayed fairly close to shore, sometimes as close as 150 yards or so. It seemed to pick up the pace, though, once it got to Alki Point. I lost sight of it after that and kind of lost it in the crowd along the main drag of Alki. Some kayakers and possibly some divers got some amazing views. Lots of boats out on the water today but most seemed to be keeping a respectful distance. Around 4:00, when the whale started to move north faster, there did seem to be an increase in the number of boats closer to it and headed the same direction. I was unable to tell if they were chasing the whale or just going the same direction. It was just a fantastic afternoon and it was so fun to hear the excitement in the oohs &amp; aahs of the kids and adults around me. What a treat! I never thought I'd see this right off the shores of West Seattle. You can see my pictures of the whale posted on Picasa here.

We observed a <b>lone gray whale</b> approximately 100m off the west shore of Me-Kwa-Mooks park, West Seattle. We began watching from the park at 1330 and continued for about 30 min.

We saw distinct feeding behavior, seeing the animals fluke and pectoral fins as it was on its side in the shallow water. Hope some of you also enjoyed the sighting,

many people, including me :~) at the lighthouse in discovery park were watching a whale close to shore within 200 yards right at the tip of the lighthouse point. it swam from there towards <b>ballard locks</b> and then towards the north. others seemed to think it was <b>a grey whale</b>. it was by itself. it was about <b>1pm </b>today. what a sight to see on such a calm water day!!! i hope it is healthy and able to make it's way to where it should be going - it is not 'normal' for grey whales to be in puget sound, is it?

<br/><i>We do get Gray whales in Puget Sound each year - one group of 10 - 12 whales arrives each spring to feed in the waters of N. Puget Sound, around Whidbey &amp; Camano Islands and in Possession Sound. But each year we typically get a few "stragglers" from the migration north that aren't strong or healthy enough to make the full migration, and often arrive in Puget Sound skinny. These whales may not know where the good feeding beaches are, and there are usually several Grays that unfortunately don't survive and wash up somewhere on a Puget Sound beach. sb </i>

A small <b>gray whale</b> spent much of this morning foraging just offshore on the north side of Colman Pool, Lincoln Park, <b>West Seattle</b> - much to the delight of a gathered crowd of adults, children, and dogs. Around 11:00 am, it headed north to Lowman Beach (about 1/2 mile north). Amazingly, when I opened the photos on my computer, I saw that the angle of the sunlight gave some of the blows a rainbow effect I hadn't seen with my naked eye!

At <b>730 </b>this morning, I saw what looked like an unusual disturbance in the water, just south of Brace Point (W. Seattle), very close to shore. It was in about 15-20 feet of water, but close to the drop off to much deeper water. It appeared to be a large whale, black or dark gray, with no dorsal fin. It looked larger and also longer than the Orcas we've seen around here. At first, it was moving quickly and sporadically, just breaking the surface of the water and not showing much of itself. Then it started moving slowly in a circle for a few minutes, disturbing the water, mostly submerged. It then partially surfaced and spouted twice, a few minutes apart, then swam off toward the deeper water, showing a lot of it body before disappearing. Approx coordinates: N 47 30'59.04, W 122 23'47.04 Thanks!

I went kayaking today. I put in at the Mukilteo Light House and paddled over towards Whidbey Island, in hopes of spotting some of the gray whales that have been roaming around there. And, around <b>3:05pm</b> I encountered one! This <b>gray </b>appeared to be feeding in the shallows off <b>Whidbey Island</b>, about a mile north of the Clinton ferry terminal (exact coordinates: N47 59.934 W122 22.195). I watched as this gray blew repeatedly, then lifted its white pectoral fin into the air, holding it there for 15-30 seconds, before submerging completely. It repeated this blow followed by pectoral fin display another 3-4 times. I'm guessing it was feeding. After the last pectoral fin display, the gray whale submerged then began swimming in my direction. I backed up to give it more distance, and, as I backed up, the gray changed direction and began heading almost directly east towards Gedney/Hat Island. I gave it a several minute head-start and then began pursuing it, watching for its blows, being careful to maintain a respectful distance. I followed it for another 50 minutes, watching it blow, sometimes arching its back, exposing its tail fluke, then diving for an extended period. I was luckily enough to continue spotting its blow, and I was able to follow it all the way to a point just north of Gedney/Hat Island. I last saw it at 4:05pm (exact coordinates: N48 01.806 W122 19.942), when I had to turn around and head back to Mukilteo Light House. A google map of my GPS path can be found here, with two markers for the first and last sightings of the gray whale.
I also filmed this entire encounter with a wearable HD video camera. I was able to capture the initial sighting and all the subsequent sightings. The video of the initial sighting is pretty good overall. Unfortunately my respectful distance and the lack of zoom on this waterproof HD camera make for a lack of significant details for identifying this gray whale. It's cool to watch, if for no other reason than to watch the pectoral fin display as it fed. I'll work on paring down the video sizes and post them for you and others to see via the Orca Network Facebook page. I'll also see if I can get some video editing / effects software that will allow me to zoom in on some of the sights I detailed above, take stills from the video, etc.

It has been a while since I was able to get out on the water but today was that special day when despite sizable waves, gusty winds and plenty of wet spray, we had whales! It made our Zodiac trip all the more exciting to see the killer machines, the <b>Transients</b>, the <b>T49's</b> and the big bull <b>T103</b> milling around. They were identified by Mark Malleson who was Skipper on the Zodiac. The whales were onto something, beneath the surface when we arrived at <b>2pm</b>. We never saw the kill but could smell the oily slick off in the distance and could see the clean-up crew, the Mew Gulls, fly in to take the crumbs off the surface of the waves. No doubt a hapless, Harbour Seal. We first saw them off <b>Albert Head</b>, Vancouver Island, after a tip from shore. We left them heading toward the Victoria Harbour and south east.

Mark Malleson and Ken Balcomb were taking the newly reconditioned research vessel "Shachi" out on its first day of break-in sea trials off <b>Victoria </b>when Mark spotted <b>killer whales</b> heading east a few miles west of the Victor Hotel buoy off the waterfront. At <b>1003</b>, we had just approached the whales when the RCMP approached us and conducted a rather extended interview to be sure that we were operating under permit (enforcement will be vigorous this year, they said). We relocated the whales at 1023 and identified them as <b>T49A, 49A1, 49A2, 49B and 49B1</b>, who had by then found an adult male Steller sea lion.

A dark <b>dolphin-like cetacean</b>, larger than a harbor porpoise with a larger dorsal fin farther forward on its back but not as large as that of an orca, sighted at around <b>3:30 - 4:30</b> p.m. at 48.097N,-122.5114W in <b>Saratoga passage</b>. It was apparently feeding - I couldn't tell if it was struggling with a seal or going after the same prey. I watched through binoculars and saw no blood. Other seals watched calmly while this was going on for over half an hour, so I'm assuming the seal wasn't hurt. The cetacean jumped clear of the water periodically but mostly stayed under water in a small area with one large seal and causing the water to roil at the surface.

Eric and I went out this afternoon to photograph whale pits (this is part of an Orca Network &amp; Cascadia Research program to chart whale feeding areas throughout the year). The tide was not very low, but there are quite a few. While we were at it we flew over to Hat Island and found three whales off of the SE tip of the island. One of the whales was easy to ID as "Patch" (#49). They were doing deep dives and headed towards Mukilteo. 
<br/>Update: Here are some of the pictures I took of the <b>3 gray whales</b> about <b>5:30 Pm</b> last night off of the SE point of <b>Hat Island</b>. I got a pretty good sequence of Patch (#49) and I believe #53. Patch seems to have a few more scars on his/her left side, pics 20 and 32 really show it.

At around <b>7AM</b>, over 3 hours before high tide, gotta call from a <b>Mariners</b> Cove neighbor, that<b> a whale</b> was out front. On a totally calm morning, gray, started its swirling/feeding activity. Very close in, 100' out from shoreline. Again, slowly, moving southwest towards <b>Polnell Pt.</b> Watched, for 20 minutes. Hard to say if this was the one yesterday, who is staking its territorial claim here or a new kid on the block.

<br/>*<br/>
30 minutes before a <b>10AM </b>high tide; <b>a single gray</b> started what became a major meal near <b>Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Isl)</b>. After, feeding out front for 30 minutes, I took to the water via boat to continue whale watch. Gray, fed very close to shore for over an hour, slowly heading southwest towards Polnell Pt. Along, the way, gray slept?/rested just off shore, probably its body, on the bottom for about 45 minutes after the hour feed. Pretty much in the same place, with once every minute spouts. Then, started feeding again, all the way down to N.E. of Polnell Pt. Turned around, and headed back up to Mariners Cove, feeding most of the way. At Mariners Cove, at <b>12:30PM</b>, [3 hours after first seen in this area] it turned around again, and went out to deeper waters in mid channel. Heading, S or SW, back towards Polnell Pt. To all concerned, yes, throughout feeding/resting, I kept boat a respectful distance away, with motor mostly turned off. However, one time, while I was adrift 100/125 yards away, talking to a guy fishing, it headed right for us and came within/less? than 50 feet to briefly feed for a minute or two, before moving on.

In the early afternoon of March 22nd, a group of us were thrilled to see a smallish gray whale close to shore off Carkeek Park in Seattle. After about 15 minutes, we suddenly saw two, maybe three, orca dorsal fins approach the gray, and appear to harass it. We all commented on how unusual that seemed. After another 10 or so minutes, the gray started moving north along the shore, with the orcas still nudging right up alongside it. At the time, I called a NOAA phone number someone gave me and reported this into a voicemail. I hadn't learned about Orca Net yet.

<b>12:35-12:50 p.m</b>: lone whale - appeared to be <b>a small gray whale</b>, covered with barnacles, in shallow water which is bare sand during lower than normal low tides. Approximately 1 mile south of <b>Carkeek Park in Seattle</b> (47° 42' 23.2452"N, 122° 22' 49.692" W), moving slowly south/southeastward, appeared to be feeding. sorry, no photos or videos - only other whales seen in this same area was a pod of Orcas (including juvenile/s) in October approximately 10 years ago.

This time I got to see <b>the whale</b>, not just his feeding pits. This AM about <b>9:30</b>, I noticed our neighbor on the edge of the bluff with his camera. Sure enough, <b>a lone gray</b> was in so close to the bluff I hadn't see it from the house. I watched him feed for over half and hour. Sometimes the gray floated on his side, with his head down, without moving either fluke not fin for quite some time. That's when the seabirds moved in very close. When the whale swished his tail, the seabirds scattered, only to regroup as things quieted down (see photo). Unfortunately, no ID shots. Hope the neighbor might have one.

My husband and I spotted <b>one Grey Whale</b> in <b>Crescent Harbor</b> - (the span of beach on NAS Whidbey's Seaplane Base, in <b>Oak Harbo</b>r, just behind Crescent Harbor housing) today around <b>noon</b>. He went back and forth for a bit--we spotted him while we were still on shore and watched a bit, and then set off for a very close to shore trip in a kayak. The whale stayed parallel with us maybe 150-200 yards away for quite some time. We stayed very close to shore--close enough that we could put the paddle down and touch bottom most of the time, so it wasn't too far off. When it did divert from the parallel path with us, it seemed to be heading along the shore to the Southeast. There is a small peninsula there, and once the whale was close to that I lost sight of it. We probably watched the whale for 25-30 minutes. Despite the fact that I said 'he/him' above I have no idea if it was a male or a female. It spouted a quite a few times and would come just slightly out of the water--only enough for us to see it's head and back from time to time (I'm not up on my whale lingo, sorry!) ;) I will say today is definitely right up there in my top five days of amazing days of being here in the PNW!!!!

"Probably" <b>a gray whale</b>, definitely not an Orca, not a Minke. Time: about <b>3:25PM</b>. Place: north side of Strawberry Island, east of <b>Deception Pass (NE Whidbey Island)</b>. Appeared to be just a single whale. It remained in the area for some time. I watched it for at least 15 min, then had to leave for another commitment. I watched it using binoculars from the south shore of Fidalgo Island. It surfaced and spouted several times in a few minutes, then remained submerged for a longer interval. It Resurfaced and repeated the behavior regularly. It appeared to be feeding in the area rather than passing through. One spy hop observed. Good sightings of the tail a couple of times as it submerged. the area forward of the tail had a conspicuous pattern of vertebra. Difficult to estimate size from where I was. I did get some photos but most just show the spouting, nothing that will likely help in identification.

<i>Thanks to photos from several of you this past week, we have been able to identify three of the "regular" N. Puget Sound resident Gray whales, confirmed by John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research (see their Gray whale ID catalog - click on the very top link).
Through photos of the whales' flukes (see above) and dorsal ridges, Whales #21 and #22 were identified, and #531 was identified also by the pattern of pigmentation on the pectoral fin, which was matched by a photo Veronica von Allworden had of #531's pec fin. Thanks to assistance from Veronica and other volunteers, we are hoping to obtain ID photos of all our local Gray whales' pectoral fins to assist with IDs in the future. Since much of their behavior in these waters is feeding behavior, often the pecs are all that are observed or photographed, so cataloging Pec ID photos could be helpful in IDing our local whales.</i>

We have been watching undetermined whale for approximately 40 minutes. We live in a condo just off the beach, eastern shore of East Passage - <b>Commencement Bay, Tacoma</b>. Appears to be <b>a single whale</b>, difficult to tell what breed but looks to us rather large, possible Gray. Has not breached but have seen part of its back above water. First spotted the spout approximately 500 yards off shore just south (maybe 100 yards) of the floating breakwater at Redondo boat launch (just couple hundred feet south of Salty's restaraunt). Circled for a bit, then headed south, closer in to shore, perhaps less than 300 yards. Has stayed in this area for 30 minutes. If familiar with the area, 150 yards south of the southern end of the boardwalk at Redondo. Will stay under for between 3 and 8 or 9 minutes, then spout several times before submerging again. Wish we could tell type but certainly a whale of some kind.

I was just leaving the Victoria office to head back to San Juan Island in late afternoon when Jim Maya called with a report of <b>transients </b>and a sea lion near <b>Kelp Reef</b> in Haro Strait. I arrived on scene at <b>1723 </b>and observed seven transient killer whales (<b>T124A, 124A1, 124A2, 124A3, 124A4, 86A, and 86A baby</b>) swimming rapidly and erratically in circles in the tide rips. Jim said that he had seen them thrashing a sea lion about thirty minutes earlier, but had not seen it since. At 1807, I briefly saw a very relaxed looking Steller sea lion just in front of T124A1, but could not determine if it was still alive. Gulls arrived around the same time, so I presume a trophic transition was underway. The tide was flowing rapidly and pushing us all toward Henry Island when I left at 1827. I came away very impressed, once again, at how tough these one ton sea lions are; but, they are no match for a pod of killer whales.

Around <b>1630</b>, we saw <b>two Grey whales</b> heading west, up <b>Port Susan in Front of Sunny Shores</b>. After watching them slowly pass in front of our house about 150 yds off shore, we were treated to one of the whales launching vertically out of the water more than ½ the distance of its body and slashing down. Don't know if it was the second whale or the same one, but moments later, we observed it a second time. The whales then continued heading up the shoreline towards McKee's Beach and Kayak Pt. Wow, that was a real treat!!! We have had lots of sightings since the end of Feb.

As I was preparing to leave Victoria and come back to San Juan Island in the <b>afternoon</b>, Jim Maya called me with a report of a half dozen <b>Transients</b> one mile SE of <b>Kelp Reef</b>. I spent about an hour with them just before sunset and documented <b>T86A and T124A's</b>. Dave will check the photos tomorrow and we can let you know exactly who was there. It was freezing cold and choppy in the north wind! At least one sea lion was taken by the whales. Jim said he saw one sea lion and then it was gone for half an hour. Later, I saw one sea lion pushed around by the whales.

<b>Orcasound hydrophone 1646</b> - <b>Transient orca calls</b>. Val's automated detector picked (transient calls?) up this afternoon. No other detections before or after at Orcasound or any other hydrophones, so no indication of direction without further analysis.

We were lucky enough to find <b>Transient Orcas</b> on the West Side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, on the Canadian Side of <b>Haro Strait</b>. We were just leaving the Kelp Reef marker, after watching eagles and sea lions, headed south toward Lime Kiln, when Jonathan shouted out, "What's that?" "Orcas!" I said. They proceeded to kill and eat a Steller's Sea Lion, weighing perhaps 2200 lbs. It was an amazing sight that I have seen only two other times, and both times right in this area. One other time the sea lion got away.

We were lucky enough to see a small pod of <b>4-5 orcas</b> headed south a mile or so south of <b>Double Bluff, Whidbey Isl.</b> around <b>9:30 am</b>.

At approximately <b>1pm-2:30pm</b> 1 mile <b>South of Clinton Ferry dock</b> on Whidbey Island. (<b>Orca</b>) whales seemed to be feeding. It is known to me as a fishing hole in front of my house where I was during my lunch time when they caught my eye and stayed for an hour and half. Took videos both from bluff and beach. The video shows a minimum around eight blows in a matter of seconds. One whale had a distinct white marking that came up and behind dorsal fin. In the 8-12 whales I saw there were two younger ones, one small and one a bit bigger, trailing four whales that seemed to move together. Hope that helps your research. Maybe you can tell me which Pod I saw.

Around <b>11:30 pm</b>, just as I was about to fall asleep; I heard a sound. As, in, was that a spout? Got up and went out into the patio and sure enough there was a gray. In the dead calm of night, the swirling/swishing, during the late snack was almost a roar/rushing sound of a river. Then, after a couple of minutes, a mighty blow. Gray, slowly moved south towards Polnell Point after the 15 minute visit. Now, hoping for a day sighting, but, I'll take last night for a starter.

Thanks to Laura Spehar for forwarding this report on: This morning, on a news tip, I diverted from my trip to the office and spent 15 minutes filming a mother and her calf (<b>Gray whale</b>) apparently feeding in the sediment 50-100 ft off Marina Beach (S. edge of the Marina), <b>Edmonds, WA</b>. There were about a dozen people on the beach in awe of the spectacle. What jumped out at me was the idea that the mother and her calf found a feeding spot right at the Edmonds Marsh outlet. In fact, I wondered if they used the discharge pipe as a scratching object. The thought struck me that if we could open up, daylight, increase the tidal flow, the open marsh could be an enhanced source of organic material that would further enhance the benthic food for these whales. They presumably eat amphipods living in the sediments. That is, a real salt marsh might help the whales. Regardless, I am reminded that the Marsh is a resource that connects the watershed to the Sound. And possibly to the whales from Baja.

We spotted two whales that I think they were Minkes. There were at least two of them that spouted at the same time. We were watching from the deck of our home at Warm Beach. They seemed to be 1/2 between Camano and Warm Beach in front of the Camano Country Club area in <b>Port Susan</b>. We would see the small dark fin and the long dark body. They were stirring up the birds that hung around. They spouted single shots. We were not close enough to hear the spouting. They seemed to be slowly traveling north, but they stayed quite awhile, one hour at least, in that spot. We started watching them about from about 6:00 and watched <b>until 7 pm</b> when it got too dark.
<br/>Linda Underhill
<br/><i>Though it's difficult to determine, my guess is these were <b>likely gray whales</b> from the behavior described. Though they don't have dorsal fins, often the pectoral fin or tip of the fluke is seen when they are feeding. The spouts of Minke whales are seldom visible, and they tend to move around rather than stay and feed in one spot for a long period of time. sb</i>

Waiting for the <b>4:30</b> Kingston ferry - saw a spout, doubted it, then a few more (not very big, sort of fan-shaped) then a curve of back with just a slightly hooked bump on it. Then nothing for a few minutes, then a couple more spouts, another glimpse of a curve with the bump. Then no more. Another passenger who scubas said it was not very deep there, some ling cod in that area. Perhaps a (darkish) gray whale or a small humpback?

We found some <b>killer whales</b> about 6 miles west of <b>Moss Landing CA</b> when we were heading in from our trip today. Thought we were only going to see gray whales - what a pleasant surprise! There were two different groups, one consisting of two whales and the other of three. While they were in the same vicinity, within the hour we were watching them they did not join together. When we found them at <b>1:30</b> they were heading east towards the harbor and when we left at 2:15, the group of three surfaced about a mile east of us with the pair following them at a distance. Pretty cool! I can see one of the whales has a nick at the base of its dorsal fin. Hopefully you can identify some of these guys! See ya!

We were out paddling from Langley and spotted a <b>Gray </b>heading south down the middle of <b>Saratoga Passage</b> around <b>9:30</b>. She didn't seem to be in any hurry to get anywhere. She got to the area about ¾ mile due south of Camano Head, stopped and just seemed to be "relaxing" there on the surface. We stayed a good 100 yards off and observed her for about 15 minutes, surfacing occasionally for a breath. A boat kept its distance (barely) with his engine idling and maneuvering for the "best view", and it wasn't 2 minutes after the boat arrived that the Gray started to move, fluke came up and down he went. The Gray surfaced about 200 yards off to the east of the Jet Boat, apparent to us that the Gray was now moving far faster than we had observed prior to this. The boat turned and started the pursuit, headed away from us. We could see the blows in front of the boat, with the Gray headed towards the Everett direction. This went on for a couple of hundred yards when we noticed the boat had slowed. After a bit, we saw the Gray surface between us and the boat - he had doubled back! It was pretty apparent to us at that point that the boat had "lost" the Gray as the boat kept idling in the same direction for several minutes before slowly changing his course. The Gray came directly at us, so we decided instead of hanging around to be graced with its presence, we would go on our way to Hat Island and not "tip off" the jet boat again. It worked. The boat slowly idled towards Sandy point, we headed towards Hat Island, and the Gray we could see appeared to have gone back to the same spot, resuming her relaxation!

At <b>4:30pm</b> we spotted a <b>Gray</b> very close in shore in front of <b>Tulalip Shores</b>, heading South. He was showing his fin and tail as he was feeding, very slowly moving South. My two young charges (ten year old boys) and I walked south along the beach and around the point, looking now towards Tulalip Bay. We were easily keeping pace with the Gray and delighted to see how much of his body was being exposed while feeding. Then from the direction of Tulalip Bay, we saw another blow. We watched as the second gray headed right for the whale we had been watching. They met up and fed right next to each other for about 5 minutes. Then the gray that was headed south continued on south and the gray that was heading north continued north. They passed by each other around <b>5:30 pm</b>. About an hour later we looked across Port Susan and saw two blows together, the grays heading towards the head of Camano. It was a delightful dance to watch! Unfortunately no camera!

Is it possible that we saw one or two <b>Humpbacks at Lagoon point?</b> My wife saw a whale surface so I watched for several min but only saw a fluke at a distance far to the south of us. Usually when I have seen Gray it is a long body along the surface. This whale did not show a dorsal fin only a fluke like Humpbacks I have seen in Hawaii though it was half mile away. 
<br/>Paul Kukuk, Greenbank, Whidbey Island
<br/><i>It's difficult to know whether this was a Gray whale or Humpback, without a description of the back - Humpbacks would have a small dorsal fin, and Grays have no dorsal fin, just "knuckles" or bumps on the dorsal ridge. Both these species show their flukes when doing deep dives - sb </i>

Not sure if this has been reported. but Im hearing I think some <b>transients </b>quite clearly on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at <b>1:50 pm</b>. it was very faint for quite some time but now they're very audible.

Great, clear <b>transient calls</b> (<b>8:31 pm</b>) on <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b>! There weren't any earlier auto-detections at Lime Kiln, thus far all LK detections have been fainter than at OS, and the prevalence of LK detections is increasing, so perhaps the source is southbound in Haro Strait? To me it sounds like the same calls nearly simultaneously on both streams, so maybe we have a single animal making nice loud calls?

On the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry on the way home today, we were happy to spot a few blows from a<b> Gray whale</b> just N. of the <b>Everett Marina</b> at <b>4:10 pm</b>, heading north. Nice to be welcomed back by the local grays!

After a couple more sighting reports this <b>morning </b>in <b>Dana Passage (Puget Sound)</b>, Cascadia responded by land and found <b>a single gray whale</b> in <b>Budd Inlet</b>, milling around mid-channel. It appeared to be a little skinny, but was active. It surfaced several times, arching nice and high, allowing for ID photos. As of <b>1400</b>, the whale was still there. We don t know who this is, although we do know that it's not any of the North Sound regulars. We ll be comparing it to the rest of our catalog over the next couple of days.

8-12 presumed <b>T's</b> which I spotted from the hilltop milling around what looked like a kill a mile or two south of <b>Discovery Island, BC</b>.

My daughter was visiting with us and recorded, with her I-Pod, a couple of videos of <b>a Gray whale</b>. She did take a still with her I-Pod (pectoral fin) -I have attached it. We live on high bluff just west of Sandy Point, about a mile east of <b>Langley</b>. Great fun watching these gentle creatures feed.

We had a report of<b> a gray whale</b> sighting in the afternoon in <b>Dana Passage (Puget Sound)</b>. 
<br/>Lisa Schlender, Cascadia Research, Olympia, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
Our group of 4 kayakers saw <b>one gray whale</b> 1 mile due east of the south end of <b>Camano Island</b> at <b>11:30 AM to Noon</b>. We saw the whale surface to breathe many times, probably 30 to 40, often about twice per minute but with several longer intervals without surfacing. Charted water depth at the site is slightly over 100 meters. We circled around the whale at a distance of about 200 meters, so we could not see any marks or what it did while submerged. The whale did not appear to be moving significantly during that time, so we thought it was just resting near the surface.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed a report he heard from Quintin Winks of Port Alberni, who reported a sighting of <b>orcas </b>off <b>Barkley Sound</b> by Peter Mieras of Rendevous Diving. Graeme Ellis of Canada's Dept. of Fisheries &amp; Oceans identified them as <b>G pod, Northern Resident Orcas</b>. 
We received a few more details from Peter Mieras about this sighting: This sighting was a pod of 26+ Killer Whales of G pod, Northern Residents. Graeme Ellis ID'ed one as G39.

The photo is of the feeding pits on our beach (<b>Mabana Beach, Camano Isl</b>) at a 0.2 tide, after <b>three days in a row</b> of <b>grays </b>feeding (per the Wiedmans). Again, I missed the actual whales. Some of the feeding pits were so fresh that the water in them was still muddy, and the gulls were busy feeding on the left-overs.

I saw <b>2 Gray Whales</b> this morning at <b>0700 </b>swimming close to shore (within maybe 100' or so). Location: West side of Whidbey Island, several miles <b>north of Oak Harbor</b>, on the west side (and within 100') of Polnell Point.

<br/>*<br/>
We had <b>two Gray whales</b> milling just off the point at <b>Beverly Beach</b> in the <b>evening</b>. They were not going anywhere fast and the sighting started just after sunset until dark. Mostly they did short shallow dives. Twice they dived deeper with the tail fluke clearly out of the water as they dived. There wasn't an obvious direction of movement and they were not feeding at the time. They stayed in an area I know to be between 90 and 120 ft deep. Both whales appeared to be adults, though one was slightly smaller than the other. Toward the end of the sighting they had moved about half a mile towards Baby Island / Millionaire's Cove.
