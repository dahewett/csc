Yesterday (July 31), <b>J-Pod was joined by a large portion of L-Pod in the Salish Sea</b>. We saw them as they headed north past <b>Lime Kiln </b>in the late afternoon. <b>J47 Notch</b>, pictured here, has, when we have seen him, been going back and forth between his grieving mother <b>J35 Tahlequah</b> and hanging out with some other young males in J-Pod. Yesterday he was in with <b>J38 Cookie and L105 Fluke</b>, among others. J50 Scarlet was present also.
(The August 1 update is <b>J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter</b>, for nine days now. It's difficult to imagine what she has been going through or the effort required to carry her baby hundreds of miles. We hope she finds the right time to let go, and that the body of her newborn returns peacefully to the sea. We are all struggling alongside her as we watch from afar, with a renewed fire to do whatever we can on behalf of the Southern Residents.) -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>21:30 -</b> Per my friend Ariel Yseth at Land Bank, <b>L Pod is at San Juan County Park</b>, id'd as <b>Mega, Spirit, Solstice and 7-8 others</b>. Moving Slowly- fishing. I've been listening to them on Lime Kiln Hydrophone for about 10-15 minutes. General direction southbound....They came in very close to shore at Land Bank,. kelped, and<b> departed SB at 22:00</b> per Ariel. -Donna Van Renselaar

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>17:50 -</b> And tight knit group of <b>6 very close to shore just passed Eagle Cove</b>, northbound. -Lodie Gilbert Budwill

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~17:30 - Members of J-Pod</b> (plus some others - at least the <b>L72s</b> were present!) passed Lime Kiln going north. <b>J35 and J50</b> were both there, as was we believe all of J-Pod. -Monika Wieland Shields 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>16:30 - </b>They (<b>residents</b>) are now just <b>north of Eagle Point</b>. Going north. I can see a few at<b> Pile Point</b> as well. -Chris Wilson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:15 -</b> There are whales offshore of <b>South Beach</b> heading north towards San Juan Island  - reportedly <b>J-Pod and the L12 sub-group</b>. -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

July 31st trip report - on a very foggy morning we headed towards and navigated through the San Juan Islands to Cattle Pass, checking on harbor seals and Steller sea lions on the way. The fog lifted and we continued south, where whales had been found near <b>Hein Bank</b>, and we were able to view <b>members of JPod (J16s)</b> as they foraged, and a little further south - LPOD! The <b>L12 grouping</b> was identified, we could see a lot of whales in the distance. Our closest viewing was of <b>L85 Mystery and L22 Spirit</b>, what a great surprise to find LPod today. Thanks Capt. Eric for a great day, returning to port in beautiful sunshine! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Tue Jul 31 - Sighting near <b>Secret Cove, BC</b> (north of Sechelt). We were staying at a place called Sunset cove and we watched these <b>Orcas play or feed for over two hours at 8.30 in the morning</b> on the 31st July. There were possibly 4 or 5 in the pod, possibly transients as they seemed to be following the seals into the cove.. After 2 hours they moved off in a southerly direction. Would love to ID these guys? -Louise Carter 
<br/>(<i>ID'd <b>T46s &amp; T137s, T137A and T46, T46E and T137D</b>. - alb</i>)

Mon Jul 30 - Trip Report: We motored out into Rosario Strait in choppy seas, and headed south with a report of some Bigg's (Transient, - meat-eating) Orcas off Victoria. First stop was at Colville Island to view the harbor seals and an eagle, then onward to meet up with the <b>family group of T18</b> (female born est. 1974), <b>T19 (female, born est. 1969), T19B (male born 1995) and T19C (male born 2001)</b>. They were right in <b>Oak Bay</b>, playing among the kelp beds. They then headed north toward the Chatham Islands and Discovery Bay. After watching them cruise these lovely small islands, we made our way back to Lopez Island through calmer seas, and saw more harbor seals and eagles. Another beautiful summer day on the Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>   

Great to sea more Transient killer whales are on the hunt around southern Vancover Island, <b>Sooke, Victoria. T019 &amp; T109B</b> were finding some food today! -Paul Pudwell 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Mon Jul 30 - Howe Sound - <b>~20:00 - Orcas Watts Point</b> (across from the mining museum for periods and then moved closer to <b>Squamish</b> at times)...we were out there for prob 45 mins viewing them along with about 1-4 other boats at different times.
At first we spotted them heading South, for about 20 mins I'd say,  with one very large whale on the far left (East) of us and the rest of the pod on the far right (West) of us. It was so interesting!! Why do they do that? After about 20 more mins of slow travel they switched directions and started heading North/back toward Squamish again. Right before we left to head into Squamish they started heading South again. T46 in Howe Sound. T46s and possibly the T137s. (See article The Squamish Chief w/video). -Vanessa Doak

<b>J50 Scarlet</b>, born December 2014, here swimming in Haro Strait, off the west side of San Juan Island, along with her family and<b> all of J pod &amp; L87</b>. J50's prognosis is not good, she is emaciated and shows no sign of improving. All of us are holding this little girl in our hearts with hope. An unusual photo of the day call to action in these unusually difficult times. Along with others, Monika encourages us all to take action and let our voices be heard on behalf of J50, J35 and her deceased baby girl, and all of the Endangered Southern Residents:  -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, July 29, 2018
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

July 29th update from San Juan Island: it has been an emotional week up here. As of this morning, we heard <b>J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter for now going on 6 days</b>. Some other<b> J-Pod </b>whales did come in last night as well and we saw the <b>J16s (from shore) off Land Bank</b> this morning, including J50 Scarlet who is pictured here. We refuse to let J35's vigil be in vain, so please join us in participating in the governor's task force process in whatever way you can, starting by attending the meetings August 7 in Wenatchee and August 28 in Anacortes. The public must be engaged in this process to ensure serious action is taken, and not just a few token feel-good efforts that will not substantially help the Southern Residents. It was a day full of many magical moments. Here's one of them. (Lime Kiln Point State Park, July 29th, with <b>all of J-Pod</b>). -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, July 29, 2018 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:25 p.m -</b> Listening to the <b>Limekiln hydrophone on my computer, hearing orca (S1?) calls</b>. I open up a live webcam (Desticam) showing Lime Kiln live. I caught a <b>glimpse of an orca</b> surfacing at the top of the view, maybe 150-200 yards offshore. Less than a minute later, a fishing vessel charges by just off the rocks, maybe less than 50 yards out. Very very loud. Poor orcas. No more calls heard. If Desticam records, you can catch it at about 2:25pm or so, 7/29/18. -Deb Frost 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
What a heartwarming day, seeing some normalcy amongst <b>J-pod members, and L87 Onyx</b>, who were mixed in with the J17s...So thankful (and yes, J35 is still pushing/carrying her deceased calf, day 6 now. <b>L87 Onyx (left) and J38 Cookie (middle), and perhaps J22 Oreo? J38 Cookie alongside others.</b> -Jill Hein   
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:15 p.m. -</b> we just watched the whales from South Beach! ...Thank you for the update! I've been trying to ID them with my not so great pictures but not having any luck! We followed them (from shore) from <b>South Beach all the way to Lime Kiln</b>! Thank you for sharing your info and love of whales with us.

Sun Jul 29 - Jervis Inlet/Strait of Georgia - <b>09:30-09:45 -</b> Hi there, Orca sighting <b>Jervis Inlet</b>. Reporting <b>4 orcas</b> seen swimming within ~100m of the shoreline of the west side of <b>Hardy Island</b>. They were swimming from north to south. They would make circles occasionally, either playing or feeding, though no bait/prey was observed. Last time I saw orcas in the area was over 5 years ago, although I don't frequent this area often myself! Please see pics for whale markings. I have more photos, not sure what exactly is needed for ID. Would like to know if you are able to identify them, and any info. -Thank you, Laura Bekar

July 28 - <b>5:24 p.m - Just saw 3 </b>what I'm assuming transient orcas off <b>Spring Beach</b> on Gabriola island...about 5 whale watching boats then 5 motor boats following them. We thought they would for sure turn around cause it's so narrow but we saw all the boats speed back past us so they must have made it through (between<b> Mudge and Gabriola</b> heading Northbound). -Emily Green

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Bigg's T46s, T122, T137s</b> - Puget Sound - July 28 - <b>8:28 p.m -</b> Orcas still heading north. Closer to the center of the channel, at <b>Fort Casey</b>! -Brittney Herndon 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Not quite Saturday night sunset whales, but not too far off. The <b>T137 and T46 transient orca pods passing Lagoon Point</b> as they exit Admiralty Inlet on a stunning summer evening. We are fortunate to have these whales in our midst at a time of seemingly insurmountable odds facing the future of the iconic Southern Residents. Many of us are having to compartmentalize our reactions to the pleasure of watching whales in the wild, mentally separating the two eco-types to deal with conflicting emotions; it has become almost too overwhelming to see the beleaguered Southern Residents at all, knowing of their precarious struggle to survive and the ineptitude displayed by agencies and government in taking the necessary steps to save them. -Sandra Pollard

Dolphins - July 29 - <b>~3:00p.m.</b> - Can you identify this <b>dolphin</b> we saw today in<b> Budd Inlet</b>? (<i>Confirmed <b>Common dolphin</b>, see photo - alb</i>) Maybe a little SW of Gull Harbor in Budd Inlet. A few hundred yards off eastern shore...They were super friendly and wanted to play. My husband was swimming in the water before they showed up and they almost came right up to him. There were 3 of them and they stayed in the same area for almost an hour just circling the boat. One of the Common dolphins who remain in Puget Sound, primarily in the southern portion, seen here in Budd Inler. A large number of Common dolpins in 2 groups arrived in 2016, most left, but a small number remain. -Shelia Faker

Trip report - it was another beautiful sunny day as we headed towards San Juan Island, with reports of Resident whales again; the <b>J17s,</b> the family of 6 whales who recently lost a newborn calf, were meandering southward along the west side. We gave them a LOT of space, so photos are very distant. Several research boats were checking on them, let's hope they're finding plenty of salmon. After a short visit with those Endangered whales, we headed towards Deception Pass to see a juvenile humpback whale, appearing to find food in the very strong incoming tidal currents just east of the Deception Pass Bridge, quite a sight! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:02 a.m -</b> small group of orcas between <b>Eagle Cove and False Bay</b>, floating north. Two of the babies playing with sprouter male, jumping on his head, wrestling. Very cute. Close to shore. -Chris Wilson 

<b>9:02 p.m. -</b> Milling around between Johnson Point and the <b>SE end of Harstine Island</b>. -Tina Davis

I don't know how we got so lucky! This morning between teaching violin lessons, our neighbor Joe texted me and said, "whales are still there!" (<b>Carr Inlet</b>) I had a 3 hour teaching break so replied, "let's hop in my car and head to the boat!" After a near boat/gas disaster (long story), we were heading home pretty glum. And then we spotted them! We stayed 200 yards away (photos taken with 15-300mm lens), as is the law. Although one time, one went RIGHT under our boat, making waves on the surface, and you could FEEL its heft under there. The neighbor boys kept exclaiming how they were all SO unbelievably lucky. I concur. And in front of Mt Rainier to boot! The last time I saw whales, I was their age on MY neighbor's boat, and now they can grow up saying the same. -Cora Reuter Foster

July 25 - Rosario Strait - At about noon today my wife spotted <b>Orcas in Rosario Strait</b> (from the house we are renting on Peapod Lane on the east side of Orcas Island). We watched them for 30 minutes or so as they transited north to south through the main channel, <b>between the Peapod rocks and Cypress Island</b>; we first spotted them looking to the northeast toward Lummi Island from our vantage point and watched through the time we lost them to view to the south, still in the main channel. There were three for sure, most likely four. Because of their distance from our view point and us viewing via 10x42 binoculars, we cannot report any identifying information - we didn't have good enough looks. One may have been a male, but hard to say, although one did have a larger dorsal fin. -Bryan and Kathy Slinker

We were out for a boat cruise this evening trying to beat the heat when we saw the <b>Orcas</b>. We never expected to see whales in <b>Henderson Bay</b>, especially as far north in the bay as we were (almost to Purdy). We cut our engine and sat and watched them go by. They were so beautiful! What made me sad were all the boats getting too close and going too fast. Some boats were actually chasing them and doing what I think is referred to as leap frogging. How do we educate people to follow the rules for whale watching and to be more careful? Many likely do not follow this page but it still seems that they should know better. It makes me fearful that they won't return if they feel "harassed" though I guess this must happen in other locations as well? Please spread the word to boaters to be more careful and respectful of these beautiful creatures. Sunset hour with <b>T137 in Henderson Bay, Key Peninsula</b>. -Lisa Turnure

Dear friends at Orca Network, I am happy to share my images from July 24, 2018 when a pod of <b>orcas visited Henderson Bay, Key Peninsula</b>.

7/22 Trip Report: Another glorious day on the Salish Sea! We left Cap Sante marina with reports of orcas by Sucia Island, well within our range. We took the route on the north side of Guemes Island, passing by steep forested cliffs and beautiful rocky islands. The first stop was at Puffin Island to see some harbor seals and their pups and some sea birds, then continued north. We first caught up with magnificent big <b>Transient (meat-eating) male T73B</b>, with his unique dorsal fin. He was doing big circles around us, so kept us on our toes guessing where he would surface next! We then went a bit south to Jones Island to see <b>a group of five Ts (<i>T34s, T37, and T37Bs - alb</i>)</b> As they moved towards San Juan Island, we waited for them to resurface, which they did, behind us! They zig zagged around through the calm water. <b>T73B off Puffin Island</b>, now separated from the families (<b>T34s, T37, and T37Bs</b>) he had been traveling with much of the month who were to the south and moving west. -Photo by Bonnie Gretz, July 22

Sat. July 21st - what a day! We left Anacortes hoping to see a <b>Humpback</b> whale not too far from port, and found a <b>small juvenile</b> traveling alone by the <b>shore of Cypress Island</b>. He surfaced often, but no tail fluke. He surprised us and came fairly close to the boat. His skin appeared to be somewhat shriveled, hope he's ok. Then we received word of <b>transient orca out by Hein Bank</b> - wow - these whales were ID'd as California whales, <b>CA137, CA40, and our "own local" Transient/Biggs included T99B</b>. First time for me to see any of these whales, what an amazing treat. Lots of shrieks from passengers as several of these whales "mugged" us. Amazing sight, exciting day. Oh we had seals, a few harbor porpoise and Bald Eagles also!!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

July 21 - Rosario Strait - from ~ <b>7:15pm to 8:15pm </b>last evening at the <b>southern tip of Rosario Strait</b>; approximately 10 minutes from the Anacortes Marina. We saw the same <b>pair of humpbacks</b> earlier in the afternoon a lot further out, almost near Lummi. At that time they were just cruising. On our way back to Anacortes, the captain got a call from his friend on a smaller boat about the pair closer to the marina so we sped there and were able to witness them do this for almost an hour before they finally left and continued their swim south. Other sightings included <b>2 transient Orca Pods</b> (the male and female from the California pod) and the 4 female tran-residents near Lopez. Will share pictures soon for those guys as well. -Rohan Kamath

July 21 - Puget Sound - <b>Humpback</b>? spotted midchannel heading south at sunset from <b>Bainbridge ferry</b>. Only saw the tail flukes at a distance of approx 150 meters as it drove and did not see it again...Maybe saw white, don't remember clearly. I was talking to someone and suddenly saw it out of the corner of my eye just as the tale flukes came up and then dove. Then it was maybe 30 seconds until the ferry passed the spot where there was a smooth spot and expanding ripple from the displaced water. It was obviously a large volume of water displaced, clearly a whale. It was right in the middle of the ferry lanes - between south and north lanes, just as the two ferries were passing in opposite directions. -Jordan Van Voast

July 21 - This is really a bizarre situation, we live in Skagit Co, on Samish 'Island' which is surrounded by three bays,<b> Alice, Padilla and Samish Bay</b>. This posting (Janet Cater's below) of a whale is very unusual, it looks like a gray whale (<i>is a <b>humpback</b> -alb</i>), have you had any other sightings of this whale in the vicinity of Vendovi, Lummi, Cypress Islands at this time? Our bay is very very shallow and not sure what brought this whale into our area, but very exciting for the person who posted it, noted below. Thanks for your advice! -Charlene Day

<br/><b>10:16 p.m. - Some J Pod whales and L87 were on Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> and Orca Sound hydrophones about 10 minutes ago. The calls sounded as if they were overlapping calls, meaning the same calls being picked up by the two different HP locations, as there are a couple places where that will occur. A ship drowned out their sounds. These are the SRKWs who have been down island all day today. Not sure if they will be heard again tonight. -Jeanne Hyde

7/18 Trip Report: A lovely, cool summer day....and we headed up toward San Juan Island with reports of Resident (fish-eating) orcas off the west side. We caught a good look at some harbor seals at Dead Man's Island, and a juvenile bald eagle, then joined <b>big males J27 Blackberry and L87 Onyx leisurely fishing a few miles into Haro Strait, off False Bay</b>. They were circling, zig zagging, sometimes just hanging right below the surface. It was a beautiful time with these two magnificent guys. We left them as the wind came up, and checked out a wounded Steller sea lion on Whale Rocks. After a nice look at a mature bald eagle in his/her huge nest, we headed home. <b>J27 Blackberry</b>. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

July 18 - Admiralty Head - Greetings from North Beach in Port Townsend. Last night (18th) at <b>8:45 p.m</b>. Annette and I spotted a blow in the middle of the channel<b> between us and Whidbey Island just north of Paregos Lake</b>. There were a series of splashes and some laconic slow rotations with the long fin exposed in the air, almost like a sailboard in the wind. Annette saw the tail for a moment but was unable to tell if it was at the end of a breach or a tail slap. The distance was way too great for the camera but I made an image anyway; make of it what you please. We believe it may have been a <b>humpback</b>, given the length of the pectoral fins. An approaching tugboat and tow disturbed the event, but after the traffic passed, it took up again and moved slowly north out of sight in the dwindling twilight. It is striking how long the fin is in comparison the the tug even though the tug is further away. Thanks for all your good work. Proof of presence: pec fin of <b>humpback in Admiralty Inlet</b>. -Sebastian Eggert and Annette Huenke

I was not fast enough this morning to get a photograph, but I did get a good look at its tail..there is either a deep gash or a big white scar on its right fluke and a couple of smaller ones alongside the big one.

When we heard there were whales on the west side tonight and headed out to see them, we assumed we would find the <b>J16s and J17s</b> who had been doing the westside shuffle all day. When we got to <b>Land Bank</b>, however, we were surprised instead to see the <b>K12s and K13s</b>, with many more blows offshore!

Bigg's killer whales - July 15 <b>- T34s, T37, T37Bs, and T73B -</b> Here are some pictures from two of our encounters with the group of 8 transients, including the T34s, T37, T37Bs, and T73B on July 15 from MV Saratoga. There are a few pictures from the morning, <b>due south of Smith Island</b>, with T34 and T34B surfacing together, and T34 surfacing with part of a harbor seal in her mouth. The rest of the pictures are from later in the day (around 6:30) just <b>south of Possession Point</b> when this group caught something with very little effort - One minute they appeared to be cruising along slowly and possibly going to sleep then before you new it they were eating on something. There are a few pictures of T34 and T34B coming up in opposite directions while eating their meal, and a photograph of T73B and T37B1 swimming together. T37B1 (a young 6 year old boy) has been hanging out very close to big T73B on all four encounters we had with this transient pod on July 14 and 15. Its pretty common to see a young male hanging close to an adult male like this.  Maybe he's just trying to learn the ropes. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express.

This is my friend Pia Parrish sighting from <b>Lime Kiln Point</b> in San Juan Island on Saturday, July 14 at <b>5:19 pm</b>. Pia was with her soccer team (60 and over category and mostly from San Diego) at Soccerfest 2018 held in Bellingham this year. This was the first time most of them had seen orcas and they had taken the islands bus to Lime Kiln, so it was great timing!  They were thrilled to see the orcas! (Members of <b>J &amp; K pods</b> went by. See Pia Parrish Facebook VIDEO). -Susie Nelson

Hi ON, We had the opportunity to see<b> members from K pod</b> off the<b> west side of San Juan Island</b> 7/13/18. At first it was difficult finding orcas - the J's seemed to have headed westbound and the K's were spread far and wide. At around <b>3:30pm the orcas</b> came closer together and began to breach all around -  especially K25 and K34. (see photos below) What an amazing sight to see two male orcas leaping out of the water multiple times! We also saw a minke whale near Salmon Bank. -Cheers, Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:18 p.m -</b> I only saw <b>5-6 from LK</b>. More were presumably offshore. It was the <b>K13s</b> that just passed Lime Kiln (southbound)
<br/><b>1:43 p.m. -</b> Some orcas approaching much closer to shore and no boats with them. From <b>Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/><b>12:50 p.m - </b>Pretty sure I have the <b>K12s</b> off south beach. Other than that only firm IDs of first group I've heard is <b>J16s and J19s (and L87). K27! Off Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon</b>. -Monika Wieland Shields
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:49 a.m. -</b> I think trailers just passed <b>Lime Kiln</b>, still down island but some mid channel. We probably saw about a dozen but there were certainly more mid channel that I didn't see. 
<br/><b>11:17 a.m - Residents Just passing Lime Kil</b>n now, porpoising. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I believe we just had some of the <b>J's</b> go by - heading west through <b>Boundary Pass. Probably 12 whales </b>total but hard to say as they were all spread out. Lots of breeches, tail slaps, and other surface behaviours. Pretty special way to spend my last morning out here. We are at the southern tip of South Pender near Tilly Point. We saw them at <b>about 8:30 a.m. </b>They did look like they were heading towards Turn Point on Stuart Island. -Madison Duffin

They're back! After another nearly two week absence, some of the <b>Southern Residents returned to inland waters this morning. J-Pod brought K-Pod with them</b>, the first visit for Ks since March. This photo (see below) is of <b>J16 Slick and J42 Echo off the west side</b> of San Juan Island this morning. J50 Scarlet WAS there too, but sadly she still did not look very good....At sunset <b>J16s, J17s, K12s, K16s, and K21</b> were spread on the west side from Hannah Heights to Salmon Bank. <b>Rest of Js and K13s and K14s were northbound</b> into the Strait of Georgia. -Monika Wieland Shields   
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We got to see the <b>J11's, J14's, J19's, J22's, K13's, K14's and L87 race through Cattle Pass </b>on the strong flood current all the way <b>up San Juan Channel</b> passing Friday Harbor. We heard they were at Patos Island heading NNW late in the evening. We included some of our photos. It was a beautiful experience watching these orcas. -Cheers, Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing   
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Look who we got to hang out with today: These are <b>Southern Residents, L87 Onyx and K16 Opus with her son K35 Sonata</b>. "Resident" is a misnomer these days as they really are no longer here for the majority of the year feasting on salmon. Why? It's simple (well not really). Their main prey source is chinook/king salmon which has been in decline for quite some time and showing no signs of stopping. These are PNW icons and what whale watching is based on here. Only....that base is disappearing due to lack of food. So, when we make a big deal about seeing them it really is a BIG DEAL because they are starving and they have been spending a lot of time elsewhere. When they ARE here, there is no telling how long they will stay. Worse yet, where are they when they are not here, in their historic summer hangout? Its anyone's guess, most of the time. -Renee Beitzel

<b>Bottlnose dolphin "Stump" southbound into Eld Inlet</b>. -Photo by Kim Merriman, July 11, 2018 
<br/><i>From Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "Stump, and a possible second bottlenose, have been seen in Dana Passage regularly since Monday. With the help of Kim and others onshore we were able to find her on Tuesday. It was our first two dolphin species day in the South Sound, with the long-beaked common dolphins in Case Inlet</i>. If anyone comes across the dolphins when out on the water, make sure to give them plenty of space to do their thing. The common dolphins will probably come over to investigate you if they aren't busy feeding. And remember to send in your reports, they are really helpful!"

What a thrill to see these mammal eaters, wild and free, and on such a beautiful day. A few harbor porpoise were spotted, harbor seals, and eagles, with Mt. Baker looming in the background as we returned to port. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

July 8 - <b>~ 8:30 p.m. </b>- I live in a magical place. We saw this whale, I think a humpback (confirmed humpback - alb), breaching in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca </b>aka the Puget Sound aka the Salish Sea, on the ferry ride back to the USA, from Victoria BC, on Sunday evening. How majestic is Mt Baker in the background?! Mid channel but <b>closer to Port Angeles than Victoria</b>. See Facebook Video. -Desha Wood

July 7 - Trip Report: We left the marina with a report of <b>Transient orcas up to Canada by N.Pender Island</b>, and caught up with them after a beautiful trip through Pole Pass and Spieden Island. This was the <b>T124A family</b>, a matriarch born in in 1984, and three of her calves. They were close in-shore, heading south. At Bedwell Harbor, they attempted to catch a seal, but the seal hauled out on some rocks and escaped! They then continued their travels south and we also headed southeast home. We saw a few bald eagles and some fat harbor seals with pups on Ripple Island. With quite a few international passengers on board, it was a great trip on the beautiful Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Coastal killer whales - July 7 - <b>7:00 p.m. - Killer Whales off Coos Bay, Oregon</b>. Tucker and I were walking the beach last night and saw killer whales! I was so excited to see them! I was able to see <b>6 whales</b>, including one male. Unfortunately they were too far offshore for me to be able to get any kind of identification photos. However, they were spread out and exhibiting foraging behavior. One breach. I know there were reports of salmon in the area yesterday. Watched them forage for almost two hours. -Elizabeth Seely

Southern Residents - We've gone another week without Southern Residents in inland waters, but we've heard reports over the last three days that <b>all three pods (or at least members of Js, Ks, and Ls) have been actively foraging in the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. Here's hoping they're finding a lot to eat, and that some of those fish start making their way to the Fraser with the whales behind them! -Monika Wieland Shields

Bigg's killer whales - July 6 - Around <b>8:45 this morning</b> we saw a <b>small pod of Orca </b>(at least one adult and two calves/juveniles, no adult males) on the North side of <b>Navy Channel by Henderson Hill (in Mayne Island)</b>, Traveling east. Playing, traveling. No photos, have not seen whales in this area before. Yay! Rare to see in Navy Channel! -Katherine Littlefield

To confirm it was definitely side-tail thrashing before a shallow dive, then the hump, then the spout. It was fairly light gray in color, though it was in the shade still and again only got a quick glimpse for a few seconds while on the train. Please let me know. I guess it's best if you don't find anything, in this case. But in the rare case that it did need help I needed to let someone know. -Ryan Ottaway Martin

We covered one hundred nautical miles of open water today on Pelagic with Deer Harbor Charters. Two tours that lasted four hours each. We saw three pods of Transient orcas today, small family groups of four or five that consist of a mother and her offspring. We saw one <b>humpback whale</b> that dove deep as we watched it from afar and several minutes later as we looked all around, it surfaced right next to the boat and surprised us all. The ships log has the bullet points of when and where. We went north and all the way around <b>North Pender Island </b>and saw the (reported as: T-137's but was the <b>37As</b>  - *see Colahan IDs below)  We went out to Boiling Reef off East Point of Saturna Island and saw the <b>T-36a's and T-49a's</b> doing some porpoising as well as backwards resurfacing around prey. As we returned we went past Sucia Island and saw the humpback whale that decided to surface and exhale right next to us and startle everybody. Sometimes it seems they are as curious about us as we are of them. It was a clear day with some clouds that progressed from low and puffy to high and wispy around the islands, but the Olympics and the Cascades on the horizons were shrouded in clouds. The currents and the wind cast a predictable spray and it made it even more of an adventure for the guests. Both trips went very well and I think all of the guests gained a deeper understanding of nature that they are taking home with them. Mission accomplished this day. -Alex Callen

~<b>4:30-5:00 at Pebble Beach</b> (Camano Isl), three orcas were feeding together, circling close together, breaching and slapping. We think they were feeding on small prey, and are wondering if they were residents? Otherwise, there has been young seals in the area. -Peg Boley
