<br/><b>Reported by:</b>  	Penny Stone

<br/><b>Species:</b> 	Orca	
<br/><b>Pod:</b> 	L Pod, K Pod, J Pod	
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	south down Rosario Strait 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Big parade of orcas off west side of Lummi and all across the strait today from about 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. - could have been all 3 pods - VERY spread out - we're talking miles! The ones we saw closer to shore were J's and K's I believe (J1 brought up the rear...) - Some hugged the Lummi shoreline and some were mid-channel and some were way across on the Orcas side. A lot of breaching off the northwest beach of Lummi, then more straight travel, porpoising, some milling and lunging. Headed off down Rosario Strait. There were 4 whale-watch boats, about 5 small private boats, Soundwatch, some small crabbers passing thru, and 1 tug that stopped, apparently to enjoy the show as well. Flat calm, so you could hear their breaths from a great distance, even before seeing them. What a gorgeous day! Penny

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Susan, Saw your message from Penny. For your information I was on one of those four whale watching boats. We started to see the whales off of Cherry Point. Then we came down by Lummi Island and even further with whales following us. Penny described it best. They were dancing and we, over the loud speaker, could hear their singing. Our captain named all three pods too. What magnificent animals! Harry Moore

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Lummi Island report, continued: Then a couple hours later, 1:30 p.m. another group passed, close to shore, off Isle Aire Beach (north end of west side) - groups of 2-3, spread out - about 15-20 individuals altogether - VERY active - lots of breaching, tail-lobs,cartwheels, porpoising, spyhops....travel south, fast, again towards Sinclair Island (east side.) 1 large male (J1?) swimming farther off shore- possibly J's and K's. many females and youngsters. No whale watch boats, and only one fishing boat traveling through. Very appreciative audience on land! Penny Stone

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> L12 subpod (L41) plus most of the L12's and a number of L25's and L57 off Victoria going S.W. The area covered was miles wide which leads me to believe Kpod was also here. This leaves Jpod as the whales coming down Rosario this afternoon. Any other sightings or ideas? Ron MMRG

Saturday, June 23, 2001 14:00  
<br/><b>Reported by:</b>  	Kristen Damazio	
<br/><b>Location:</b> 	Saratoga Passage	
<br/><b>Species:</b> 	Dall's Porpoise	
<br/><b>Pod:</b>
<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	south 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Susan, Saturday (June 23rd) we were traveling in Saratoga Passage between noon and 4 p.m. and we spotted several pairs of what we believe were Minkes heading South. They were dark gray and almost black, some with white up near the dorsal fin. They made a rolling arch type movement when diving. Can you tell by my description whether or not these were Minkes? Thanks - Kristen Damazio (These were actually identified as Dall's Porpoise, thanks to Kristen's great description of their markings &amp; movement). For more info. on ID'ing Minkes &amp; Dall's, here's my response: Thanks for this report, &amp; the great, detailed description - I'm sure what you saw were Dall's Porpoise, which travel around Whidbey, usually in small, &amp; sometimes large, groups (I once counted over 75 going past Admiralty Head on the west side of Whidbey!). Minkes ususally travel alone, or sometimes in groups of 2 or 3, &amp; don't have the "arching" quality Dall's have when surfacing. Minkes are also quite a bit larger (26-28' vs. 6'). Dall's have the characteristic white patches on their triangular dorsals, while Minke's have white patches on their flippers. But it's often very difficult to ID marine mammals, since we only get quick glimpses of them as they surface, &amp; they're usually at quite a distance.

<br/><b>Pod:</b> 	L Pod, J Pod	
<br/><b>Members:</b> 	1 male in first group, 3 males in second group	
<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	passing Rosario Beach, north towards Burrows Island 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Susan, Finally news to report. About 12 noon Sat. 06-23-01 I saw a group of seven Orcas what I believe to be feeding and pass Rosario Beach in the outgoing tide rip beyond Northwest Island heading North towards Burrows Island. They were out a distance but were really working the tide rip back and forth. One large male. Then about 1305 hrs. another group or the same group passed heading North about mid channel. Unkown numbers. A park visitor said she could make out three males. I had no glasses. They were very far out for a naked eye visual. But they were Orcas. Rocky shore and tide pooling are great! We love you Man. Ranger Rick Deception Pass State Park  (Maybe J's &amp;/or L's off Deception Pass?)

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> From Lummi Island: Just a heads up of orcas passing by west side of Lummi Island tonight - about 8:00 p.m. off Legoe Bay - very far out (near Clark Island) and very spread out - unfortunately so far we could not get any kind of ID - only that we think there were at least two adult males, so perhaps an L subpod (??) - and there were about 10-15 individuals - porpoising,traveling fast, going south towards Cypress Island (probly thru Rosario Strait) - a couple of breaches. We haven't had sightings of orcas going by our island much so far this year (only 3 now that i know of) - maybe they'll begin their island rounds again here soon! Penny

There were a lot of Dalls porpoises in Haro straight today which made for a nice bonus. We even had some bowriding! ~Island Adventures

They had come up the westside of San Juan together in the morning. L pod was also in the area in south Haro by Discovery Island heading southwest (out the straits). Ls often come in and out of the straits, goiong from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to San Juan, then back out again this time of year. While Js and Ks are staying right around the islands. On this trip J pod split up with K pod at north San Juan Ks headed south and Js continued north. We followed J pod this time since there were less boats with them and had a great show! We also saw lots of other wildlife along the way including an active Bald Eagles nest on Bell Island.

He alerted us first thing so we shared the info with other captains in order to track their progress. Since we dont depart until 11 am the timing worked out pretty well. By the time we got there they were right off Discovery island and we followed them in almost to San Juan Island. Ls were making good time until they got closer to San Juan, then they slowed up and became quite social! We had a couple of great passes there at the end making for a good finale. Also saw seals, sea lion, harbor porpoises and lots of seabirds. One passenger added three birds to her life list! Island Adventures
