<b>6:30pm - Approximately 14 whales</b> in the group at the <b>south end of Lopez Island</b> feeding, hunting, socializing and playing for over an hour at sundown. -Michael Kundu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A very cool encounter with some of our regular Bigg's Killer whales, the <b>T65A's</b> along with some very rare visitors. According to Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale research, the <b>T125's</b> have not been seen in the area since the 90's! What a remarkable and interesting looking group of orca! T125's consist of T125, T125A, T127, T128. -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The <b>T65As</b> continue to be one of my favorite family groups, hands down. They are so interesting and always up to something. This was taken in Rosario Strait while they traveled with the <b>T125s</b>. -Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

And a little more info. about the encounter from Dave: We left the <b>T65A's and T125's at 1700</b> pointed east in<b> Rosario Strait </b>after they had traveled deep into Lopez Sound and then exited through Lopez Pass. To my knowledge, this is the first time the T125's have visited the area since the early 1990's. -Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found th<b>ese guys (<b>T125s and T65As</b>) near the <b>South end of Lopez Island.</b> At least 3 males, and one youngster about 2 years old maybe? We also found </b>2-3 humpbacks South of that area on our way back home! Great day on the water! -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Noon Sunday, May 31st, tight group of <b>8 orcas slowly cruised past the south end of Lopez Island</b>, going east to west. Two distinctive male dorsal fins. -Sally Reeve

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:00 pm - </b>Hi, My family and I spotted<b> a pod of Orca</b> last night (May 31) while sailing <b>just south of Point Roberts Marina</b>. The Pod was fairly widely dispersed, we believe that there were <b>a minimum of 10 and I'd guess more like 12 - 15 were present</b>. They were in pairs or individuals spread over approx 1 mile of area. We were approx 48d 57.8N, 123d3.2 W and the pod was all around us, traveling east towards White Rock, BC. We saw them around 8PM We didn't get close enough for any detailed descriptions. We did see one Orca Breach 4 or 5 times, and another one flip it's tail completely over it's head. Amazing creatures. -Andrew Green

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hi we were boating towards the ferry strip tonight around<b> 7:30pm</b> and we became surrounded with <b>10-15 Orcas</b>.  We were in our 19 foot boat and the Orcas were <b>swimming southeast close to Point Roberts</b>. It was amazing. I would say there was 2-3 pods. There was a massive Orca with a 4 foot fin plus a mama with a calf. The calf was small like a newborn. They were magnificent- majestic- beautiful. The mama &amp; calf came the closest to our boat 50 feet away. The massive Orca with 4 foot fin was about the same. We were the only boat...I will NEVER forget this experience. Wish I had pictures for you! -Karen Conley-Giles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Here are a few shots from a nice day in calm waters with all of <b>J-pod, in the Georgia Strait </b>a handful of miles of<b> Entrance Island (Nanaimo, BC)</b>. Lots of socializing and activity! -Andy Scheffler

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Some of the most amazing and rare <b>Bigg's Killer whales were around the San Juan Islands</b> today! We later learned after Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale Research identified these as the <b>T125's. (T125, T125A, T127, T128)</b> These orcas haven't been seen in here for a very very long time! Was a very special thing to see them. They were with one of our regular groups, the <b>T65As</b>. -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:15 pm - J</b>ust saw <b>T's</b> in past hour <b>off South Lopez Island</b> moving southwesterly...and <b>2-3 humpbacks </b>south of that, aboard Puget Sound Express. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

We were watching a busy group of <b>transients (near Bamfield BC) </b>and then we noticed the <b>humpback</b>.  The HB kept a low profile and the Bigg's whales passed on by, but there was certainly lots of spy hoping and breaching by the Bigg's. Certainly lucky to get  both in the same shot. -Sandra Pollard &amp; Richard Snowberger

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

No orcas yesterday on our trip out of Anacortes on Mystic Sea but we did catch up with <b>three humpbacks somewhere near South Pender Island</b> including we believe Big Mama and Windy. -Bob Mepham

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>1:00 am - J pod calls on Lime Kiln</b> now. -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At least <b>two transients</b> (I saw two bulls for sure, though there may have been a third cow) did a close swim-by of <b>Ogden Point here in Victoria</b> today around noon! I managed to catch up with them just off of <b>Oak Bay Marina around 1:45pm</b> before they carried on towards the San Juans from Chatham Island. Not the greatest photos but it was certainly a thrill to see them! -Michelle Rachel

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

We encountered low fog by <b>Rosario Strait</b> - and with news that J-pod was back in the area - we headed between the San Juan Islands, and by the time we reached the west side of San Juan Island, the fog was gone - and <b>there was J-pod!</b> They were spread out in several groups, and the first group we encountered were the<b> J-16s with their TWO new babies</b>. What a thrill for us all. They were heading west, so we turned towards home and found some of the <b>J17s</b>, also heading west. Amazing day! We rounded out the day with Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, harbor seals, bald eagles, oyster catchers, and many other seabirds. Another great day aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Some of <b>J-pod </b>family portrait - <b>2 calves</b> here - saw two of the three J-pod babies...J50 and J52! -Jill Hein

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J27 (Blackberry)</b> showing his moves today near <b>Beaumont Shoal</b>. -Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Surprise! After being MIA for the last four days,<b> J-Pod showed up in Haro Strait </b>again this <b>morning</b>. While they were pretty spread out, I did see members of every matriline. <b>J37 Hy'shqa</b>, came closest to shore at<b> Lime Kiln</b>. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:35 am - </b> In case anyone hasn't mentioned it, there was <b>chatter on orcasound</b> about 5 minutes ago. May still be some faint calls. -Jill Clogston

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:45 am - </b>Center for Whale Research reports <b>J pod is coming down Haro Strait </b>by San Juan Is. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Saw <b>J-pod</b> this morning in<b> Boundary Pass at 9:30ish</b>, heading west towards<b> Turn Point on Stuart Island</b>... 2 humpbacks in the same area shortly before that heading east (~8:30am) and again at ~10:00am heading west. -Madison Duffin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw them. Male was quite a distance behind the others. It seems like they were <b>past Pt. Wilson by 4:30 or so</b>. Victoria Clipper went by northbound and didn't slow down, so they must not have seen them. -Jill Hein

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:10 pm - </b>north of <b>Lagoon point</b> heading north at a good pace. East side of midchannel
<br/><b>2:55 pm - </b> watching northbound Transients from<b> Fort Flagler.</b> Mid-channel - appear to be in southbound shipping lane. Approaching Lagoon Point from my vantage. -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Was hoping to see them nearer<b> Bush Point</b> but was so happy to see them at all....<b>Transients, about 4 of them</b>. One lone male way ahead of group. -Marilyn Armbruster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:45 pm - </b> watched the <b>Ts</b> for 45 min. From <b>Norweigan Pt.</b> making their way slowly north. Lots of activity. Now they are off Mutiny Bay. -Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:30 pm -</b> Spent the day with <b>T036's, T087, T036B's and T124's</b> on the Edmonds Puget Sound Express tour. Caught up to these T's in Admiralty Inlet, South side of Whidbey Island. They were headed north west when we left them approx. <b>12:30</b>. They active! Cartwheels, breaches, tail lobs, spyhops, lunges and babies! -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:35am - </b>We caught up with another group that was a little further north. They've all come together and lots of surface activity going on!! Breaching, spyhopping, tail lobs, etc. slowly trending north closer to Whidbey side.
<br/><b>10:32 am -</b> We are sitting out off <b>Possession Point </b>with a small group that just made a kill. One large male and 3-4 females. -Renee Beitzel, Naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>


These <b>two feeding humpbacks</b>, often surfacing as close as they could get to each other were in<b> Swanson Channel between North Pender Isl and Prevost Isl</b> heading in no hurry towards Active Pass. Humpbacks seem to like this area. -Peter McAllister

I got the pleasure of spending my <b>evening</b> with mammal-hunting orcas, known as <b>Transients (T077A and T124C) in Deep Cove, BC</b>. I love traveling north into the Canadian Gulf Islands, especially in the evening. Nothing beats the lighting on those beautiful islands that are characterized by a folded and faulted succession of metamorphic, plutonic, and sedimentary rocks. Those same island/rocks record nearly 400+ million years of earths history. It's pretty humbling when you think about it! -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:45 am - </b>Just saw the backs of<b> two Orcas about 50 yards off Robinson Beach in Mutiny Bay</b>, Whidbey Island. -Raymond Bigelow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Mid afternoon</b>, we spotted a large pod <b>(about a dozen) from Cape Flattery lookout point</b>. They were heading west from the mouth of the strait, then disappeared from our view <b>behind Tatoosh Island</b>. Fabulous!! -Carol Turner

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 am -</b> I know it's not an orca but saw <b>a dolphin at Solo Point (south Puget Sound) </b>this morning about <b>10:30 </b>this morning. I'm a bit excited since it was my first time seeing one since we moved here. (possibly the lone Pacific White-sided dolphin seen in South Puget Sound since 2014-ALB). -Kim Burton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 26</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Transients</b> with calf sighted <b>15:30 in Ucluelet Inlet</b>. (Including <b>T074</b> per Melisa Pinnow). -Shana Richmond

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was a wonderful encounter with <b>T77A and T124C! </b>Two Bigg's Killer whales (transients). They were being very social together and then a big cargo ship wake came by which they SURFED! I haven't seen that in a while. Then they did lots of tail slaps to celebrate the surfing! -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Another <b>T77A and 124C </b>kind of a day, near <b>Java Rocks, BC. </b>It is special when you are the first boat to find Orcas in the morning. We left them in the afternoon headed up Swanson Channel. -James Mead Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Encounter with <b>Bigg's/Transient males T77A and T124C</b> -James Mead Maya
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 PM - Possible [humpback] whale near Vashon Island</b>. Spotted repeated spouts separated by more than a minute from the ferry <b>between Vashon Island and Southworth dock</b>. Could occasionally see back of whale with very small dorsal fin break the surface after spouting. After a private motor launch passed its location heading south towards Colvos Passage, the whale began what I think is called lobtailing. The tail and flukes would come completely out of the water, wiggle/wave about, then slap back into the water. It continued doing this at about 1 minute intervals until we moved out of sight. -Patrick Poor

Great day today spent with many different groups of <b>Transient (marine-mammal hunting) orcas.</b> We were on the water for about seven hours and loved every minuet of it!
The first group of Transients we saw were the <b>T018's/T019's, T124A's, and T051</b> who seemed to have switched groups overnight (he was traveling with the <b>T075B's</b> and <b>T036A's yesterday</b>). These whales were <b>traveling west close to Sooke, BC</b>. On our way home Captain James Maya found the other Transients that had been seen earlier today near Kelp Reef! Thankfully Captain Jim stayed with the orcas until we got on scene! On our second trip, we got the treat of being the only boat with the orcas for about an hour as we observed <b>T077A</b> (one of the "twins") and <b>T124C</b> in the beautiful evening light. It was totally serene ... Oh, and did I mention I got to see my first SEA OTTER EVER?!!! Yeah ... that happened! -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Made the long trip to<b> Race Rock to see the Ts </b>heading west, and then found some on the way home! Great day. -James Mead Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:50 pm -</b> I can still hear them but no visual. Happy Memorial Day orcas!
<br/><b>8:30 pm -3 -4 orcas headed slowly south off of Dilworth</b>, Vashon -Aimee Demarest

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45-5:50 pm - From Bremerton Ferry</b>, I spotted <b>orcas</b> spread across the <b>eastern half of Elliot bay in/near Bainbridge Ferry lanes</b>. There were <b>at least 3 small groups of 4-6 orcas</b> per group <b>heading due west towards Eagle Harbor</b>. Robust tail slaps, strong blows and a synchronized surfacing of 4 large orca. Smaller one in lead group. Awesome! Only a few other people looked up from their cell phones when I yelled "ORCAS!!! -Donna Green Van Renselaar

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Returning from Blake Island around <b>5:30</b> today we observed <b>a pod working approx 1/2 to 1 mile north of Alki point</b>. They were working as a team circling around in about a 1/2 mile radius. Tail slaps and a couple of nice breaches. Cool for sure. -Lori Hunt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:30 pm - Single Orca</b> sighted in<b> Elliot Bay </b>headed East. -Ian Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>4:30 pm - </b> Michelle Goll and I followed them south past <b>Richmond Beach</b>, they are just west of mid channel, split into 2 groups, one group should be visible from Carkeek by now. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:35 pm -  </b>I'm at <b>Kayu Kayu Park </b>(Richmond Beach, Shoreline) and they're spread<b> from north of the ferry (Kingston) to quite a ways south from there</b> past the yellow mid channel buoy and the point south from there... They're moving south quickly.
<br/><b>3:07 </b>see several at Kingston ferry now. -Michelle Goll

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

One <b>Male Bigg's/Transient </b>ame within 40 feet of shore and surfaced at least twice. They were visible off in the deeper water for at least a half hour. -Steven Gardner

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were on a 30' sailboat coming down from Mystery Bay on Monday, and saw <b>a pod of at least 5 </b>close to the mark just <b>north of Point No Point</b>. Then the pod moved and stayed very close to the<b> Point No Point light house </b>and fed there for some time. We saw either the same pod or another one about 6 or 7 times on the way back to Elliott Bay! They seemed to be paralleling our path! Have never experienced so many orca sightings in one day! Incredible!!!! -Marty Wilhelm

<b>3:00 pm - Lone Orca taken from Eglon. Around 3pm ish</b>..(I think) I hope some one can identify and let me know who I caught on camera! It was a great day. Saw a total of 3 different groups and the lone guy today.
<br/><b>1:45 pm - At Point No Point</b> Saw <b>3 total </b>one group. And the baby included! And another who has some scarring on the side. Hope this one can be identified.

<b>1:20 PM - Orcas at Point No Point.</b> We were on the Southeast shore of Point no Point and sat down. When we looked up we saw a huge dorsal fin right in front of us! The Orca swam off and we thought it odd it wasn't in a pod. Then we walked back around by the lighthouse and the pod was out there meandering. We tried to take a video but our phones could not zoom in. It was a Beautiful sight and I will never forget how big that dorsal fin looked! -Betsy Tarpley

I watched this wonderful interaction today from shore. A couple kayakers were trying their best to get out of the way but there was wind and current. <b>J52</b> decided it really, really, really wanted to take a close look at the kayaks. Mom (<b>J36</b>) instantly cut the kiddo off, and even though the kiddo tried to wriggle over her again, mom blocked J52 again this time pushing the calf pretty much out of the water and away from the kayak. And off they went, lesson learned. Pretty funny to watch. It was very clear that she wanted the calf to have no part in these kayaks. -Traci Walter

<b>4:15-4:55 pm - </b>We were headed over to fish for ling cod and this<b> pod of orca surrounded us between Bainbridge and Seattle</b>. Do you know which family group it was? The big male had 2 big notches out of its dorsal fin....they were playing with a sea lion for a good 30. At one point the sea lion tried to hide next to my 19' boat. Made me very nervous with the orcas coming in and out under my boat trying to get the sea lion...there also was an orca about 4-6' long with them. They kept circling around like they were waiting for it. Did those transients recently have a calf? Video taken around 4:55PM <b>between Yeomalt Pt on Bainbridge and West Point on the Seattle side</b> in the middle of the shipping channel. here was a separate group of 4 that were right off Yeomalt that we saw earlier that were moving quickly heading north and hugging the shoreline.

<br/>(Video ID comments per Melisa Pinnow: <b>Chainsaw T063 </b>is that male with the two notches. The T037, T065, &amp; T090 matrilines were probably there too and if you saw another male, he was probably was T087)

Here's more from my encounter with <b>J Pod between Matia and Sucia Island</b>. These whales were in a resting pattern, where they essentially turn half of their brain off, alternating "sleeping" hemispheres in their brains a number of times during a resting period. When orcas rest, their behavior is also more predictable. They will go down for a 3-5 minuet dive, then surface for 5-6 breaths. J Pod circled around and stayed between the two Islands for about two hours hours last night, barely moving from that location. I don't get to observe the entire pod (minus the independent J16's) resting together very often! I'd take this over breaching whales any day. Watching "resting" resident orcas is like meditation for me. The way their exhalation comes up in synchronicity like smoke stacks, with their breaths equally as in sync, "koof, koof, koof", sends me to an incredibly peaceful place. I'm so grateful that I was there to whiteness this! -Heather MacIntyre

Orca watchers, below is your final update on<b> L84's</b> movements, whose <b>satellite tag detached by May 23</b>. The <b>96-day deployment </b>exceeded the K25 deployment in 2013 by 3 days and was much later in the year, providing the first satellite-linked tag data for Southern residents for the entire month of April and much of May. With the deployment of the tag on J27 in late December 2014 and the tag deployed on L84 in February, we were able to monitor the movements of some of the Southern Resident killer pods for nearly four and half continuous months this winter and spring. 
<br/>On our previous update of L84's movements (11 May) he (and likely at least a few other whales) were off the entrance to Clayoquot Sound. They continued south and on the evening of the 12th had reached the offshore area of the Juan de Fuca Canyon. By the morning of the 13th they were off Cape Alava and our colleagues from Cascadia Research Collective attempted to intercept the whales but were unsuccessful due to rain and sea state. They whales continued south - by the morning of the 15th they were off Cape Elizabeth, off the Columbia River the morning of the 17th, and off Tillimook Head on the morning of the 19th. The whales headed back north such that they were just south of the Columbia River on the morning of the 21st. Our colleagues from Cascadia Research Collective were able to intercept the whales late that day and document L84 in the presence of at least a few other members of L pod. They also observed that the tag was just about to detach from L84 and by 23 May, the next scheduled transmission day,
no signals were received. -NOAA-NWFSC, courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

I emailed you over a year ago, but since then I have become a full-fledged (pun intended) and obsessed birder, and have been neglecting orcas a bit recently. Well, no more! A bonus is that my birding practice has honed my ability to identify calls, something that might help me during hydrophone sessions. I navigated to the hydrophone site by accident at <b>10:20 PM tonight</b>, and decided to have a listen. Boy, am I glad I did! <b>S1 calls</b> all over the place, with some<b> S4s</b> mixed in too, and a few <b>S2s</b> here and there.

Here's some pictures from today's encounter with <b>J Pod</b>! Today we watched as J Pod tried to push against a raging current <b>at East Point</b> for at least two hours, barley making any headway around the point. They were being very social along the way breaching, spyhopping, and cartwheeling. The encounter was kind of bitter sweet for me though, I wish they'd conserve more energy. Since their habitat is no longer productive with their primary food source, Chinook salmon, these orcas are going to need all of the calories they can get. Despite my concerns, it was definitely incredible to watch. We also got to see some great displays of family unity through respiratory synchronicity as well! -Heather McIntyre

Encounter report: It was lots of fun seeing<b> Chainsaw (T63)</b> and his friends around <b>Anderson Island</b>. The most I have in any one shot is 5, but I think there were 2 distinct groups of 4-5 individuals, and maybe more than that. We were shooting entirely from beaches, and they <b>came across from the center of the Sound between Chambers Bay, McNeil, and Steilacoom, then headed around the tip of McNeil </b>so they were between Anderson and McNeil, heading toward Eagle Island. Once they got to the pier on McNeil beyond the prison, they milled around and went back the way they came, played off the Anderson Island ferry dock for a while, and then headed up the east side<b> between Anderson and Ketron islands</b>. At that point, they were moving fast in two widely spaced groups toward the south tip of Anderson Island and were out of our sight. What a day! (I definitely got my exercise booking it up and down beaches . Still working on IDs, but we got a lovely visit from the orcas today - at least the <b>T65s</b> (matriarch T65, her daughter T65B, and grandchild T65B1), adult female T37, T63 "Chainsaw" (the male with the huge notches in his dorsal), and the T124s (matriarch T124, daughter T124D, son T124E, and grandchild T124D1). Many thanks to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for working on IDs with me! 
<br/><b>2:10 pm - </b>Changed direction and now headed <b>between Ketron and Anderson Island</b>...there were so many originally...the ones we saw heading south past Anderson Island were probably 7, and I think prior to that, we saw 9-12, so it wouldn't surprise me if they split. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

There were killer whales everywhere in the Salish Sea yesterday! Residents and transients ... We ended up spending time with <b>J Pod </b>and were fortunate enough to encounter these individuals: <b>J16/50, J42, J14 /45, J34/38, J19/41/51</b>. J41's mother, J19 Shachi, was always extremely attentive to her and I suspect this is part of the reason why J51 seems to be doing so well thus far. He's got a great support system. -Heather MacIntyre

Lots of whales today... A number of transient orca, including our old friend Chainsaw (<b>TO63</b>), made a foray through the whirlpools and swirling currents<b> into Deception Pass</b> before separating later into northbound and southbound. Those northbound had a hard job bucking the 7-knot current and eventually took the easier route out<b> through Canoe Pass</b>, while southbound whales headed towards <b>Saratoga Passage</b>. A rare treat to see so many transients together socializing and hunting with some full breaches and tail-slaps thrown in for good measure. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist/Author

<b>Transients were in Penn Cove all afternoon at least until dark about 8:30</b>, roaming unpredictably but mostly in the same general part of the cove, just north of the mussel rafts except a brief visit to the <b>Captain Whidbey Inn by T063</b>.

(They claim that it was the same pod seen last week, with two small juveniles. "They were going towards the bridge, then disappeared for a while, and then they came back up," Horn said. "So it was about all of 25 minutes." Horn watched them reappear on the inland side of the bridge, and then they disappeared before coming back up where Horn caught the Killer Whales on camera. She said she saw them quite a ways up the river, all the way near the Mo's restaurant a few blocks away".

Had several <b>transient orcas</b> a few miles of shore off<b> Depoe Bay, OR</b> for the whole day. They have recently killed a baby grey whale in the area that washed up on Thursday and they were seen eating a Stellar sea lion yesterday. I have attached some of the better photos of the transients I have from the trip. I would love to help you in any way possible and if you hear of any orcas in the central Oregon region please keep me posted. Thank you! -Stephanie Young
<br/><i>Dave Ellifrit: I'm pretty sure the bull is <b>T165</b>.  The last pictures I have personally seen of him were from 2007, also off Depoe Bay.  In those photos, another kw had raked him good and his fin has drooped a little since then.  He wasn't in the last DFO catalog but perhaps he has centralized his range down the coast rather than in inshore waters.  I had several encounters with him along with T166 and T167 in SE Alaska in the 1990's with NMML.  It's nice to know he's still alive.</i>

A few highlight shots from the largest groups of Biggs killer whales I have ever seen yesterday <b>just off Entrance Island</b> (8-10 miles NE of Nanaimo). We had the<b> T23's, T36, T36B's, T86A's, T100's, T101's, T124's and the T124A's</b>! -Gary Sutton

A meeting of the matriarchs ... This was during a large congregation of <b>Ts, there were at least 25 whales</b>, likely more. They were split into groups that were roughly organized by age and gender, the adult males (<b>T102, T100C, etc</b>) were more-or-less on the outskirts of the entire thing, doing who knows what. There were two groups of predominantly calves and juveniles that were, as to be suspected, pretty bouncy and surface active. Then there was <b>this main group which consisted almost exclusively of the older females and mothers</b>. There was a lot of physical contact between them and they were not spending much time below the surface. There was also lots of vocalizing happening. One can only imagine what was being exchanged between them. -Tasli Shaw

We spent the afternoon with the <b>T124A's</b> and watched as they made a successful harbor seal kill. Transients aren't always flashy when they make a kill, an often will disperse of their prey underwater. This time, however, they brought the seal to the surface before the "degloving" process started! The seal is below the orca, you can just make it out! -Heather McIntyre

Orca watchers, here's a few more updates on tagged orca <b>L84</b>. As of the last update on 30 April L84, and at least a few other members of L pod, were <b>off Willipa Bay</b> heading north. By the morning of 1 May, they were off <b>Grays Harbor </b>and continued north, reaching mid-continental shelf west of <b>Destruction Island</b> by the afternoon of 2 May before turning south. By 3 May, they were off <b>Grays Harbor </b>and the morning of the 4th the found them off the middle of the<b> Long Beach Peninsula</b>, where they turned north. L84's transmitter again changed to an every other day duty cycle on 4 May to save power such that the next transmissions on the morning of 6 May showed the whales northwest of<b> Cape Alava</b>. By the morning of 8 May, the whales had made a big jump north to the continental shelf break <b>west of Estevan Pt. on central Vancouver Island</b>. By the morning of 9 May, they reached the northernmost point of this excursion - they were still on the shelf break about 25 km <b>south of the Brooks Peninsula</b>, which is about <b>3/4s the way up the west coast of Vancouver Island</b>. By the morning of 11 May, they continued south, moving more inshore and were at the south end of the entrance to the <b>Nootka Sound</b> and by the afternoon were off the entrance to <b>Clayoquot Sound</b>. -Map and update courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-Northwest Fisheries Science Center

<b>7:00 pm - Orca sighting in Budd Inlet</b>, milling about, splashing vigorously, blowing spray. <b>6 Orcas</b> sighted off <b>Priest Point Park</b> in Olympia. In coming tide. Orcas very active and in very shallow water over sandy bottom. Appeared to be 2 smaller Orcas among the group.

<b>12:45 - </b>The water was dead calm in<b> Possession Sound</b>, visibility good for miles, and the <b>humpback</b> whale delighted our passengers, on both cruises, with lots of excellent views of the fluke (tail) as this ~50' whale dove many times. California sea lions and Steller sea lions vied for position on the channel marker, and many Pacific loons were a treat to see. What a great way to end the "Gray whale-watch" season, it seems they received the memo, as no gray whales have been spotted for the past few days.

...When Captain Spencer Domico and I got on scene we found <b>Windy </b>traveling slowly just off <b>Patos Island, WA</b>. surfacing then diving down for about six minutes in a foraging mode... For a while, we were just watching a whale from 200+ yards away surfacing here and there, and every time she'd go down, she'd pop up in an entirely different location. So, we just drifted for a while (it's always nice to hear the exhalation that comes out a little less than 200mph anyway). There's always a certain beauty in watching wildlife no matter what their behavior, but <b>Windy charging for our boat and spending over an hour with us</b> was the LAST thing I expected at that time.  And then it happened, Windy surfaced closer than normal and was heading in the direction of our boat, the Legacy...At that point, to start the motor and move out of her path would have been dangerous to her, given her proximity to the boat. So, we stayed in shut-down mode and waited for her to mosey on by. -Heather MacIntyre, Naturalist, Maya's Legacy

Windy the <b>Humpback whale</b>  mugged nearly everyone. This particular Humpback what has a tendency to approach boats on occasion. (she is not always in this mood) None of the vessels in these photos drove to her, she went to them. I was watching her this day for nearly 6 straight hours. For about a half hour or so, she would be doing normal behavior swimming along. Then which ever boat was closest after that 30 min was up, she was drawn to them by reasons that we can only guess why. After "mugging" (getting close to a boat by her choosing) she would move along, take a break, and then check out a different boat. In addition, I noticed that each mugging seemed to have a pattern of it's own. She would look at people on the side, then poke her nose out at them for a time, and then the finale was always her tail up in the air. She seemed to loosely follow this on each of these muggings. If you are lucky enough to have her approach you, please shut down and enjoy. This is behavior of her own choosing, please don't force yourself on her. I've had an encounter similar to this last year, but have no idea if it was Windy or another friendly Humpback whale. All I know is that it was one of the most memorable moments of my life. These animals are making a comeback, however they are facing many man-made threats such as shipping traffic, potential oil spills, and fishing gear entanglements. -Traci Walter, Naturalist, Western Prince

On the evening of May 7th some friends and I were able to head out to the tip of <b>Cooper Point </b>to watch the <b>T065A matriline</b> exit <b>Eld Inlet </b>from shore...The five of them were making their way out of the inlet at a medium pace, with a few surfacings followed by a deep dive that would last a few minutes. At one point, one of the kids did a funky tail slap that created a good splash, but other than that the orcas were in travel mode. They were aiming for Squaxin Island as they slowly disappeared from view, their loud exhales still audible. -Melisa Pinnow

<b>5:00 pm - Saw a Gray whale in Port Susan</b> (north Puget Sound) while out kayaking. It was traveling south just a 1/4 mile south of Cavalero Beach Park. (Camano Island). It must like to look at boats because I was 300 yards from it and heading away from shore to get out of its way and the next thing I heard it it blow 50 feet behind me! I tried but did not get a good picture of it. It may have had a white patch just rear of center of its back, on the left side. I thought the people with the houses on the beach at Country Club Estates where going to get to see a whale but when it got to their mooring buoys it stopped feeding and head out to deep water. -Andrew Dillon

WOW. Our encounter today with the <b>T65A's and T65B's</b> was incredible!! The weather was also stunning. Lots of sun and calm water. We made our way to <b>Hein Bank </b>off the south end of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Thought they had been celebrating a kill, however when we looked closer we realized that they were playing with Common Murres! (They are a black and white seabird that we have here). While not unusual to see younger orcas essentially using these birds as target practice and honing their ambush skills, it was unusual that it lasted so long! We even got to hear their vocals with our hydrophone in the water. We also got to see our other wonderful wildlife including a couple mature Bald eagles, Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, and the powerful tidal currents of Cattle Pass. -Traci Walter, Western Prince

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found the <b>TO65A's &amp; TO65B's</b> west of<b> Hein Bank </b>in the morning and we were treated to one of the best Transient Orca encounters ever! The T's were finishing off a kill when we first encountered them and then began to celebrate their kill, it was an amazing spectacle. In the afternoon we encountered the group between Hein Bank &amp; Salmon Bank and they were still playing. We witnessed so many breaches, tail slaps, cartwheels, spy hops and pectoral waves, it was unbelievable! In 10 years of Whale Watching this was one of the best Transient Orca encounters of my career. -Andrew Lees

<b>7:00 pm -</b> Watched from the observation deck on the bluff at <b>Cape Flattery </b>as a group consisting of <b>1 adult female &amp; 3-4 babies</b> made its way into the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca...They approached from open ocean <b>S of Tatoosh </b>&amp; swam N into the channel nearest the shore between the shallow reef inshore of the island &amp; the mainland. Once they reached the mouth of the Strait they turned E &amp; presumably continued on deeper into the Strait. -Todd Gillman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 pm -</b> Jimmy and I headed to the <b>La Push/Neah Bay</b> area this weekend to search for gray whales along the migration on the coast. We found the<b> grays</b> (and a few babies) but we also spotted <b>orcas</b> (our first ever!). Not sure if they were residents or transients since there were only <b>about 5 of them</b>....1 Male, 3 females and baby! -Codi Hamblin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Not sure which details Codi already provided but here's the quick run down.  Saturday 5/2 around 6:00pm we saw approx <b>6 orca cruising east between Tatoosh island and the final view point on the Cape Flattery Trail</b>.  They were cruising close to shore and appeared to be headed right down the strait.  I counted 5-6 whales including 1 male, 4 females and what looked to be a baby. I initially thought it was a dolphin because the dorsal fin was so short and curved more than the other whales but it was obvious it was an orca when they breached closer to us. Unfortunately they are really hard to photograph and I was also trying to not watch the whole event through the camera viewfinder.  Hopefully these are somewhat useful...The initial sighting was in the golden sun reflection on the water and was quite beautiful / surprising. Super excited to have had the chance to see them at such a cool spot. -Jimmy Wood

So there we were, getting a look at Windy (the <b>humpback</b>) for the first time this year when all of a sudden the <b>T65As and T65Bs</b> came speeding (make that racing! high speed porpoising!) from the distance straight toward Boiling Reef and the Steller sea lions that haul out there. T65A2 and T65B were over half a mile in the lead and got to the unsuspecting raft of sea lions first, and the rest of the whales were porpoising out of the water at high speed, apparently swimming as fast as they could to catch up with T65A2 and 65B and join in their hunt. They successfully managed to separate a sea lion and proceeded to take turns ramming it and fatiguing it to the point where after 45 minutes the sea lion bobbed at the surface one last time and all the whales disappeared underwater. They milled around, presumably consuming their kill, for over an hour. The gulls moved in, along with hundreds of Bonaparte's Gulls which made for this overwhelming scene of whales breaching and tail slapping with hundreds of birds swirling and dipping around...it was chilling to see that sea lion fight for its life but fascinating to watch the calculated way the whales handled it. T65A, 65A2, and 65B did most of the work, taking turns rushing the sea lion, while the younger animals waited on the sidelines. The younger whales almost seemed restless at times, vocalizing at the surface and rolling over each other and at times circling in close to the sea lion with the adults. I've never seen a kill on a large mammal take place from start to finish. It was a privilege. -Tasli Shaw

<b>10:24 am - 5-6 orcas off of South Finger Island and Johnson Point on Sucia Island</b>. They were either playing or hunting as they were tail slapping and porpoising frequently. They didn't seem to be traveling in any specific direction. Saw them when we were leaving Sucia Islamd, it was certainly an amazing way to end our 5 day camping trip! -Jennifer Smith

What a day! All three of the new J<b> Pod calves, 50, 51 and 52</b>. We were so enjoying seeing moving up the <b>West Side of San Juan Island</b> toward Henry Island. Then all of a sudden they turned and came toward us. We suspect we were between them and some salmon. We got baby mugged! Especially interesting was seeing the scratches on J50 and being able to get close ups. -James Mead Maya, Maya's Legacy WW

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:15-5:30 pm - </b> I saw a group of <b>about 7 off the SW shore of San Juan Island, north of American Camp</b>. They were very close together, bobbing up and down, then going underwater for a bit. I lost them (I'm watching from a rental house on shore) when they continued south. -Christy Avery

Called in  by Jake Hylaema from the USCG, who watched <b>a male orca come into Grays Harbor</b> this afternoon, mid channel between the jetty tips, a hundred yards into the channel when he disappeared still headed up the channel.

A good start to the month - 'Mystic Sea' spotted <b>gray whale #22</b> among the whitecaps heading towards <b>Gedney Island from Everett</b>. By the time we circumnavigated Gedney she had changed direction and was going in the opposite direction towards the delta. Hopefully she's still finding plenty of food here. -Sandra Pollard
