<b>June 30, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
We had a report from a fisherman at <b>9am [orcas]</b> at St. Vincents Bight eastbound. I spoke with a fishing vessel at 1130am when I got to Kelsey bay and he said they were at St. Vincent. Around 10 am: 3+ Orca were spotted at St. Vincent's Bight close to Kelsey Bay, lower Johnstone Strait by the same unknown commercial vessel.
<br/>Jen, <b>Campbell River</b> Whale Watching 
<br/>*<br/>
I then came across a group of about <b>50 white sides</b> (Dolphins - SM) very spread out foraging in <b>Johnstone Strait</b> mid passage across from Yorke Island by the time I left they were turned to the west following a sailboat.

Around <b>1 pm: 50 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> were reported over the radio by an unknown commercial boat.

<b>9:44 pm</b> - listening to Southern Resident orca <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> while I do the whale report!
<br/>Susan Berta, Orca Network, Whidbey Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
~<b>9:10pm</b>: <b>Orcas </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> right now!

<br/>*<br/>
Riptide J30 doing a back dive in <b>Rosario Strait</b> around <b>3</b>, he later did tail waves, pec slaps, a cartwheel and a belly flop, photo taken aboard the Odyssey. A female from J pod was swimming on her side today in Rosario Strait around 3, all of J pod was VERY active with atleast 5 cartwheels, 6 breaches, 2 spy hops, 2 lunges and countless tail waves, tail slaps, rolling, pec slaps and back dives!
<br/>Melisa Pinnow, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Today we left the harbor and went up over Lopez and out into <b>Rosario Strait</b>. We were nearly to Anacortes, just outside of Burrows Bay, when we saw a massive dorsal fin slice through the water. There were a couple of smaller fins in the vicinity and as we drew closer there was a huge explosion of water as an orca breached clear and landed on its side. Another breach followed shortly after and we noticed that there were whales very close to the rock. They were moving fast, changing direction a lot and finally our suspicions were confirmed when one of the whales surfaced, on its back, with a salmon in its mouth. We were able to identify Blackberry of J pod and Onyx (L-87). The whales gradually moved around the corner, deeper into the bay. We followed L-87 all by himself to the south and then rounded the corner to meet up with the whales in the bay. There were spyhops and then more spyhops, a few breaches, and lots of tail slapping. One younger individual swam on its back and tail slapped for a good 5 minutes straight. We prepared to leave 3 or 4 times but couldn't tear ourselves away from the activity. It was the largest display of surface behavior I have seen all season. 
<br/>Laura, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
Bottom end of <b>Rosario </b>near Davidson rock. Mostly <b>J's</b> but we did see <b>K20 </b>in the mix as well. We had breaches and spyhops, it was a great show and we got to go back home through the bottom end of Orcas Island, which was gorgeous! Took us 7 hours round trip but we all enjoyed every minute of it.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:35pm:</b> We have an <b>orca </b>parade, with tour boat escorts, headed west-to-east off of Flint Beach on the south end of <b>Lopez Island</b>.
<br/>Tom Reeve, Lopez Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
Between <b>7:30 and 8:00 AM</b> we saw <b>orcas </b>from Land Bank's Westside Preserve on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. There were easily 30+ whales, so presumably it was J-Pod with the few K and L Pod whales that have been traveling with them. The whales were in a large resting group that was impressive to watch even though they were well offshore in the middle of Haro Strait. They were facing north, but making little progress against the flood tide.
<br/>Monika Wieland, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Noon: Thanks to the tip a few minutes ago, I'm hearing some faint <b>Killer Whale calls at Neah Bay</b> (on OrcaSound hydrophones).
<br/>Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:58 am</b>: Group of about <b>4 transients</b> (with no large male dorsals) were observed inside the <b>Neah Bay</b> breakwater. No kills were observed and no auto-detections of killer whale sounds were recorded.  
<br/>Jon Scordino, Biologist, Makah Tribe, Neah Bay, WA
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>7:00am</b>, there was a report of <b>4 killer whales </b>inside the Neah Bay jetty! We were unable to get any pictures or resight them but hopefully they will stick around in the area.
<br/>Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician, Makah Fisheries Management
<br/><i>from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research after seeing the photos: This looks like T36A, T36A1, T75B, and T75B1</i>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Porpoise </b>- photo taken this morning <b>11AM </b> - standing on <b>Point Wilson</b> and looking toward Marrowstone - likely two or three of them cruising north.

<b>June 29, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>10am</b>: Three, possibly four <b>Orca </b>spotted SW of Myrtle Rocks near <b>Texada Is., BC</b> heading south. Good show of flipper flapping and tail waggling.
<br/>Holly, Pebble Beach
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4 killer whales</b> (probably transients) from <b>Ozette </b>area, N 48 09.85 W 124 45.23. They were just off the shore from Cape Alava, swimming very close into the beach and circled a couple times towards Ozette Island and towards Cannonball (and around our boat!). There were at least 19 harbor seals in the area, half hauled out and half in the water. We did not see any attacks or feeding activity but did catch a couple of good taillobs!
<br/>Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician
<br/>*<br/>
Just heard a little <b>squeak </b>at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. <b>6:55 pm</b>.
<br/>Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Between <b>3:00 and 3:45pm</b> just off <b>Eagle Point</b>, as the crew (J pod+?) headed up the SJI coast. Very close to shore between Eagle Cove and Eagle Point, <b>west San Juan Island</b>, WA.
<br/>Alex Shapiro, San Juan Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/> 
Our adventures today started off a little cool, cloudy and choppy as we traveled south towards Cattle Pass. Around the bend, headed northwest into the <b>Haro Strait</b>, we began seeing intermittent identifiable black dorsal fins: looks like <b>J-pod</b> was in the neighborhood. The pod was spread out over a half mile with about ten individuals in pairs and singles. Some of the animals were even breaching! Another whale watching vessel identified one of the leaders as <b>J2, "Granny,"</b> leading the whales south but potentially changing the pod's direction to go north again.
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orca calls</b> at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones, 11:36 am</b>.

We had the <b>T-49's</b> off of <b>Sooke, BC</b> on our return trip from San Juan Island today. They were headed East.

<b>June 28, 2011</b>
<br/><br/> 
Way out at <b>South Pender Island</b>, we found <b>J27 and J34, with J34</b> doing lots of tail lobbing. Closer to the shore we spotted <b>J28 with J46</b>, with several other whales, too far distant to make ID's. It appeared they were heading towards Active Pass. 'twas a beautiful calm day out there, the sun even came out for a while. Interestingly, although the tide was fairly low, we didn't see any harbor seals hauled out at any of the usual places, that's a first for me.
<br/>Jill Hein, Mystic Sea, Anacortes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 pm:</b> It took the whale watching tours quite a while to find them, but they did. Around <b>15 Transient Orca</b> that looked like they were in two distinct groups, one group of around 7 whales joined together by Sentry Shoal, <b>mid Georgia Strait</b> below Savary Island. They were on a kill when spotted. There were at least a couple of calves in the mix. The orca apparently didn't move much and were milling about with no direction he left them in between S. End of Hernando and Mitlenatch. Also, did you hear about the dolphins that were found stranded on the mud flats in Oyster Bay also rumouur has it that there were Orca South Bound in front of CR at about 6am? 
<br/>Jen, <b>Campbell River</b> Whale Watching, sent by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, <b>Powell River</b>, BC
<br/>*<br/>
I was out there at the same time again today (<b>3:30 p.m.</b>) and the (<b>Humpback</b>) whale was also there, though kind of far out.  Saw it surface perhaps three times. I have not had any whale spottings before yesterday, but am surprised by how I can hear the sound of the blowing, even though there is quite a lot of other sound from waves, and it is quite far away.  several times I heard it but did not see the whale, it is a most distinctive sound.
<br/>Joy Jaber, <b>Hansville</b>, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:15 pm:  6 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> by Willow Point close to <b>Campbell River</b>. report overheard on radio from Eagle 30  
<br/><b>10:30 am: 2 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> were Southbound by Brown's Bay, Discovery Passage.
<br/>Garry, Aboriginal Journeys
<br/><b>7:15 am:</b> Approximately <b>20 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> were Northbound by How Island, Sutil Channel. Also while on his run, at around 8:15 am Jack saw a large, light coloured Wolf on the shore of Sonora Island, just behind Cinque Islands, Discovery Passage.
<br/>Jack, Campbell River Whale Watching    
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8 am:</b> report of <b>4 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> stranded on the muddy shores of Oyster Bay, South of <b>Campbell River</b>.   
<br/>Garry, Aboriginal Journeys Stranded Pacific White Sided Dolphins, Oyster Bay, BC  
<br/>Early this morning four Pacific White Sided Dolphins were very close in to shore by Oyster Bay, South of <b>Campbell River</b>, feeding on some small fish. When the tide went out, they became stranded on the muddy beaches. This is very unusual for these highly intelligent mammals to find themselves in this sort of predicament without good reason. Once the call went out, there were around 50 people that responded to help get these Dolphins back to deeper water. Putting them on tarps, one by one, they were carried across the mud flats and released into deeper water. They swam away apparently OK. There is talk that the possible reason for this Dolphin stranding is due to their being chased by Transient Orca. Over the past number of weeks, there have been marauding groups of Transient Orca in this area.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, BC 
<br/>*<br/>
We had another great day today with <b>J's and K's</b> in <b>Swanson Channel</b>, through Active Pass and into the Strait of Georgia. Active Pass lived up to it's name as the whales were breaching, tail slapping and pec slapping through it. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
The gigantic dorsal fins of <b>Blackberry (J-27) and Double Stuf (J-34)</b> sliced through the water as we rounded Mouat Point of <b>North Pender Island</b>. The two males appeared to be feeding when they would pause from their northward travel pattern to circle one another as they powerfully taillob the surface. Double Stuf, in his early stages of maturity at the age of 13, still bears a curved and skinnier dorsal from youth. A group of four orcas, which consisted of a very small individual, hugged the coastline as they surfaced in unison while heading towards Port Washington. 
<br/>Kirsten, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a cell phone report, received at <b>9:09 am</b>: <b>Lime Kiln light house</b>. <b>J Pod</b> with <b>6 members K Pod</b>.  33 total: 5 males, 18 females, 10 juveniles. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:54 am</b>: Only one sneaky <b>call </b>@ <b>lime kiln</b> in the last 16 minutes.
<br/>Chrissy McLean, PTMSC, Pt. Townsend, WA
<br/>*<br/>
It sure sounds like <b>echolocation </b>only just now at <b>Lime Kiln 8:28 am</b>, now just hear one faint call, sneaky?
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Key Largo, FL
<br/>*<br/> 
OrcaSound <b>Neah Bay hydrophone</b> reports: - <b>3:17 pm</b>: I'm not sure, but I think I've been hearing extremely faint whistles at Neah Bay for the past 5 minutes or so.
<br/>Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
<br/>The auto-detector also picked them up (whistles on Neah Bay hydrophone). Sounds like they could be killer whales to me.
<br/>Scott Veirs, OrcaSound/Beam Reach, Seattle, WA
<br/>It sounded like killer whales to me.  I am probably a little late on this.  Possibly L pod.  
<br/>Cathy Bacon
<br/>*<br/>
We were on aerial surveys today and saw <b>killer whales</b> off of Point of the Arches. Pat Gearin was on the water and also saw killer whales off of <b>Ozette Island</b> heading north earlier in the day. Likely he saw the same whales we saw from the air. Pat reported seeing a group of 5-7. We will have to look at photos to determine which group these whales belong to.

<b>12:45 pm</b> Around 2<b>0 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> by Eagle's Cove in Discovery Channel being playful and chasing herring which were seen leaping out of the water as the Dolphins fed on them. - Garry, Aboriginal Journeys
<br/><b>9 am</b>: Broken radio transmission by Aaron, <b>Campbell River</b> Whale Watching of a pod of <b>Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> close to Separation Head, by Seymour Narrows.
<br/>The dolphins have been hanging around at Grief Point since just before 9 o'clock. Apparently feeding but not moving anywhere. They reappeared here just after 4 but a much smaller group. They gamboled around out front here until around 4:30. Then they appeared to split and some headed south east towards Vananda  and the others north towards the mill. (Powell River)

Glassy calm seas north Haro Strait/Turn Pt.-<b>Stuart Island; 10 am</b>, aside from the usual, family constellations of <b>J pod</b>...A Date?..J27/Blackberry swimming alongside K20/Spock and her son K38/Comet
<br/>Deborah Martyn, naturalist, Orcas Eclipse Charters
<br/>*<br/> 
Around <b>3 pm</b> a glimpse of <b>Transient Orca</b> blows mid-strait still very slowly headed towards Atrevida Reef, North of Powell River. I watched them till about 1:15 and they seemed to be headed north towards Atrevida Reef about mid channel. They continued to play every so often with 3 more breaches, lots of tail lobbing and a couple of nice spy hops. There were at least 6 Orca and possibly up to 8 of them with two males and at least one calf. Certainly there was one extremely large male whose tail, when he tail slapped, looked almost as large as a small Humpback's tail. There were breaches, head stands waving tails in the air, tail slaps, spy hops, etc. etc. Then they suddenly decided to give the ferry and boat traffic a great show. They stayed out in front of <b>Powell River</b> slowly working their way towards Harwood Island for a good couple to three hours while they socialized. 10:50 am: The call came in that there were at least three Orca around the Myrtle Rocks area South of Powell River heading Northward. 
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins BC, <b>Powell River</b>, BC
<br/>*<br/>
Up around Saturna Island, we went into the <b>Strait of Georgia</b> where we finally found [<b>orcas</b>]. We spent much of our time going back and forth across the border as we observed<b> J-pod and L87</b>, a large male named "Onyx" with a solid white saddle patch on his right side and a black-indented saddle patch on his left side. The pod was fairly spread out, with a pair (female and calf?) towards the north and another pair southwest of us. While we were powered down, a pair of females/juveniles/both came by our stern within one hundred and fifty yards and passed under us, popping back up off our port bow! We only knew they had surfaced by the sound of their blows.
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>OrcaSound </b>hydrophone reports: ~<b>8:30 am</b>: Im hearing a few <b>calls </b>on Orcasound.
<br/>Tessa Watson
<br/>~7<b>:15 am: J pod</b>, such clear loud calls! background so quiet. Quiet for a few minutes, hearing faint calls again 7:26 am pdt. 7:27am: loud calls on OrcaSound. spread out moving northwardly?  7:36am, sounds like K pod now on OrcaSound 8:12 am, louder calls, echolocation and really big splashing sound on otherwise calm sounding waters - breach? cool. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks, Shoreline, WA 
<br/><b>~7 am: Orcas</b> are on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> now quite active, sounds like J's. 
<br/>Gina West
<br/>*<br/>
Saw the <b>orcas </b>pass the lighthouse heading north at <b>7:45 am</b> and a sea otter came ashore onto the bank in front of us.
<br/>Frank-Vicky Giannangelo 
<br/>*<br/>
I saw a whale out there (<b>Pt. No Point, N. Kitsap</b>) today. I heard a loud sound from the water and saw the top fin, then the large tail. It was quite dark, almost like the porpoise, but with that huge pronounced tail, it definitely wasn't a porpoise. This was around <b>3:30 or 3:45 p.m</b>. The whale was seen around it three or four more times. The first two sightings were around maybe 100 yards out? The second two or three probably double that distance, headed north, into deeper water. I lost sight of it after that.
<br/>Joy Jaber, Hansville/Pt. No Point, N. Kitsap Peninsula, WA
<br/><i>We've had multiple reports of this whale and are sure it's the same <b>humpback </b>that has been in the area between Pt. No Point and Kingston/Edmonds for several weeks now - ON</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Saw a whale just south of the northern tip of the <b>Kitsap peninsula</b> on the east side in <b>Skunk Bay</b> at <b>10:15 am.</b> It was swimming in shallow water, probably less than 20 feet deep, north bound. Smallish dorsal fin, darker in color- more gray black and solid color. No pectoral fin shown. <i>(after sending a photo of the <b>humpback </b>dorsal fin Chuck confirmed that was the type of whale he saw</i>).

Janice Ceridwen, <b>Hansville</b>, WA, called at <b>8:18 pm</b> to say she and her husband were watching a <b>humpback </b>in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, closer to the Whidbey Island side, heading slowly south, splashing and fluking. They said the flukes had horizontal stripes along both flukes, near the trailing edge. Then she sent this report: The humpback followed a pretty similar pattern to last night except no breaches and not as much tail slapping. When I called you he was about half way between Double Bluff and Maxwelton closer to Whidbey, but still towards the middle. He seemed to be feeding as he was not swimming fast at this point. We saw a great part of his back and dorsal as he surfaced and he is BIG. As it grew dark it became difficult to spot him. He was staying down for some time, and he covers great distances in such a big inlet. Then, at once I noticed him only about 200 ft off shore of the Hansville Store, north of Point No Point. He had come across, just like last night. Finally, at <b>9:45 pm</b> he seemed to dive deeper with flukes high, increased his speed and headed south. No photos, too dark. (But, my husband saw a pattern on the fluke early in the evening with the scope, which he related by phone to you.)

Saw <b>two dolphins</b> in Henderson Bay about 400 yards off the mouth of <b>Minter Creek</b>, at<b> 5:30 pm</b>. I don't know what kind. They seemed to be a dark brown. They were heading leisurely to the south. They were swimming slowly and only a part of their back and dorsal fin came out of the water. My impression was they were dark brown, but they didn't come out of the water far enough to see any markings. Actually saw what I figured were the same two animals several days before heading north on Henderson Bay towards Wauna.

<b>8:32pm: Orcas</b> at Eagle Cove (west <b>San Juan Island</b>) now - feeding behavior. We enjoyed the company of the whales at Eagle Cove until dark, nearly 2 hours. Feeding behavior turned into playful behavior of a mama and her youngster practicing breaching over and over again! The youngster looked like a slippery little pickle squirting out of the water at first, then it caught air! Perfect little breaches...at least a dozen or more!

We found a mix of <b>J's and K's with L87</b> just north of East point in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>. They were very active, lots of spyhops and breaches and we got to see J2 playing with her great granddaughter J37.

As we reached the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> north of Lime Kiln, we saw what we were looking for, <b>killer whales</b>! Lots of them! The pod was spread out so we didn't know which direction to look; whales were breaching to our right, some were lob tailing to our left. They were all being super playful, it was quite a view!

Near Monarch Head on <b>Saturna Island</b>, slowly heading towards Eastpoint we were lucky enough to find the lead whales further north than anyone thought, and it turned out to be the <b>K13s! K25</b> and his large dorsal fin were easy to spot, and as we sat quietly with engines off, Scoter slowly moved through the glassy water about 200 yards away. Suddenly he made a quick turn and we knew what he'd found--FISH!  There must have been more than one as we saw tons of bait fish boiling to the surface and could only surmise a small school of salmon were in the area too. And then K25 showed his prowess by literally exploding to the surface--flinging a HUGE salmon into the air! In 15 years of being on the water, this was only my 3rd or 4th time to see this, and my first to get a picture of it!  Soon other whales were moving through the same area, looking for more fish.  Lots of surface percussive behaviors, including spyhops, tail lobs, and as a pair of massive tankers passed by, several breaches and another rarely witnessed phenomenon---whales surfing the huge stern wake of the vessels!!  It was all smiles as we headed back to the harbor, and it ranks as one of my best days of the year out on the boat.

There were many <b>orcas</b>, perhaps two pods, spread out over a large distance.

<b>Transient Orca</b> Reports throughout the day, from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, BC:
<br/><b>10 am:</b> a crackling Whale report came in (via radio). <b>11:20 am:</b> another report came in which was just as crackling with a location of possibly Whaletown, Cortez Island. Later, the BC Ferry Tacheck, reported seeing Orca just milling about for over an hour from 12 pm between Whaletown and Heriot Bay, <b>Quadra Island</b>. Once the tours managed to find these Orca at 3:35 pm by Francisco Point, Cape Mudge area of Quadra Island, they were provided with a spectacular show of breaching, tail slapping and general socializing of between <b>5 to 6 Transient Orca</b>. They continued along the Quadra Shore up to Rebecca Spit (the Spit in the initial crackling radio transmission - SM) then back down towards Francisco Point. Aaron, of Campbell River Whale Watching called in the report and said that by the time they left, around 5 pm the tour must have seen around 20 or so breaches from these very active Orca. 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>6:30pm</b> a group of us were at the <b>Point No Point</b> lighthouse, where we saw the Victoria Clipper speeding down the sound. Then it halted off Point No Point where we saw a gray whale (we believe this was a <b>humpback</b>, reported by others &amp; recently photographed in the area - ON)  do several breaches as it headed north.
<br/>Michael Howell
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>8:00 pm</b> saw a huge splash way out in the distant shipping lanes right next to a sail boat under sail. (My location: between <b>Point No Point</b> and the Hansville Store.) Checked it out with the scope, it was actually much closer to Whidbey Island.  It was a <b>humpback </b>doing alot of vigorous tail slapping. While I watched the sail boat kept its distance and sailed south. The humpback continued to tail slap and spout for at least 15 minutes. Then it was gone, so I haven't any idea which direction it headed. While I was reporting my humpback sighting this evening to you, he swam across the shipping lanes and is now a little closer to the west side of the inlet. Then he headed out to deeper water, breached a couple of times and headed south around 9:00 pm.
<br/>Janice Ceridwen, Hansville, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:22 pm</b>: <b>Two Humpback Whales</b> and possibly a third were spotted again close in front of the Rona store by <b>Campbell River</b>. These whales looked similar to the Humpbacks seen over the past while. They are possibly a mother and calf with the third one which would be an escort, usually a larger male protecting his future mate. These Whales were first reported over the radio around <b>11:30 am</b> from an unknown source. Two tours were with them later in the day: Tenacious 3 from Discovery Marine Safaris and

We observed what we believe to be a <b>humpback whale</b> at the tip of <b>Kitsap Peninsula</b>, close to shore, right off the tip of <b>Hansville</b>, between Skunk bay and Norwegian Point, Hansville from <b>9:30 pm to 10:15 pm</b>.

We headed southeast over the top of <b>Lopez Island</b> and down the east side, we moved out from under the cloud and into the sunshine. Guess who was waiting for us in the sunshine? <b>Orcas</b>. Resident orcas. Lots of them. We found them in Rosario Strait. They were spread from the near side of the channel all the way across toward Whidbey Island. It was tricky to get a good ID as they weren't coming up too far out of the water, but our best guess from the partial saddles that we got was at least some of J pod with a possible few K's and maybe even an L or two mixed in. Shortly after our arrival there was a bit of splashing and we did get to see a little guy breach a couple of times off in the distance. There was one tight group that stuck together the whole time we were there that included one big male and a couple of ladies as well as a juvenile and a calf.

We saw a group of <b>Orcas </b>today from the beach about <b>3:40 pm</b> west off <b>Deception island</b> moving into the straits in the direction of South Lopez Island. They were moving at a fairly fast pace and spread out in open water. At least one whale watching boat was following them at a respectable distance. After looking out over the water so many times over the years we finally saw a pod of orcas here.

We came across the same pod of<b> 4 killer whales</b> that we saw yesterday, in relatively the same area just outside <b>Moss Landing (Monterey Bay, CA)</b>. First they were heading west towards the harbor and were being a little elusive so we hung back. Then, they turned east and became extremely playful (see photo below). The young whale in the group breached dozens of times and it looked like the adults were getting frisky-- and our suspicions were confirmed when we saw Tony Thomas' photo! This pod was so interesting because of how active and playful they were-- usually the transients we see will be social for such a short period of time after they kill something then continue foraging, but these guys didn't quit the entire time we were with them-- same as yesterday. They seemed truly happy.

We saw <b>4 transients</b> a few miles outside of <b>Moss Landing</b>-- one calf, one juvenile, one female &amp; a male. When we found them there were tons of birds and the male swam right for us carrying a huge slab of blubber from an elephant seal. It looked like he was holding it between his pec fins!! The group was really active; tail slapping, pec slapping, and the calf breached several times. The whales turned their attention to a fulmar and spent a great deal of time harassing it by slapping it with their tails and dragging it under water. They left it alone, barely alive, and moved on to another fulmar a few minutes later. They at least put the second one out of it's misery! What was really interesting was when a live fulmar scurried over to the dead fulmar and pecked at it a few times, almost like it was trying to see if it was okay.

Can't believe it is only June as it seems like mid July out on the west end of the <b>Santa Barbara Channel</b>. We got close encounters with at least <b>30 Blue Whales and 15 Humpbacks</b>, but there were a lot more spouts EVERYWHERE in the near and far distance. Incredible for June. Sightings were just north of the Santa Rosa/Santa Cruz Islands gap. We don't see many cow/calf pairs, so it was pretty cool. We also encountered about <b>a dozen Pacific White Sided dolphins</b> and 800-1000 (total of about 3 group sightings) Common Dolphins (see photo under "dolphins" below). Lots of Sea Lions and quite a few MolaMola's including babies. :)

We have had <b>Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> feeding between The Mission Bay channel jetty/<b>San Diego River</b> (Dog Beach) and the Ocean Beach pier for the past few days. Monday (6/20) I observed some going into Mission Bay (most likely to get a snack from the bait barge).  Today they were in close to the surf line and the ocean was very flat so I was able to observe multiple <b>dolphins </b>herding the bait fish with pressure wave together.

<b>2 pm</b>: The same t<b>hree Transient Orca</b> including <b>T002C </b>were found in Whale Pass by Rendezvous Island headed in a North-Easterly direction. A short time later they did a bit of zig zag and started Southward. Garry left them around <b>3:30 pm</b> close to Hill Island in Sutil Channel with some other whale watching boats. These are the same whales that have been in and around the same general area over a number of weeks now.

A little farther north along Mayne Island and BAM: whales! They were all over the place and being a little sassy too. It looked like J30 "Riptide" and friends/family from <b>J-pod</b> were together, with several cow-calf pairs. Even further, many of the calves--and some of the adults--were incredibly active, with tail slapping, pec slapping, upside down tail slapping, SPY-HOPPING, and breaching!  And not just the lazy kinda-sorta breaches; we're talking full on clear-the-water breaching!

Lots of <b>whistles and calls (S1, S16)</b> were detected by the WhoListener program this morning, first at <b>Lime Kiln</b> from <b>6:08-6:19</b>, then at <b>Orcasound </b>(5 km north) from <b>7:47-7:52</b>. Seems like some of the southern residents (<b>J and K pod</b>) are working the west side of San Juan Island, as members of both pods were observed and/or heard heading north towards and/or up through Haro Strait last night (5/21). Did they double back and then go north again this morning or were they really (~9 hours?) spread out?

Early this morning, <b>orcas </b>trickled by, slowly headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. I saw the first ones at about <b>6:20 am</b>, but I suspect the true leaders came by earlier than that.  Orcas continued to trickle past for about 2 hours. I believe I saw all six of the J17 family group, J16 and some of her group, along with other Js. The K13s and J27 were bringing up the rear. Yes, there was romance in the air, if you know what I mean. Maybe one of the K13s will have a little one about a year and a half from now.

I heard a bunch of tailslaps about <b>4:30</b> this morning (<b>west San Juan Island</b>). We had <b>Js </b>slowly make their way to Active Pass and then jet through. We had the Js in mid-Georgia Strait heading East towards Point Roberts. Heard later they were headed back south!

I just heard that <b>J pod</b> was heading west at <b>Beaumont Shoals</b> at <b>2057</b>, so the calls you heard (at <b>8:54 pm</b>, Lime Kiln) were probably them. They did not come as far north as Bellevue Point tonight.

<b>J-Pod Orcas</b> in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, heading northwest from Whidbey and Smith Island toward Lopez and Salmon Bank with calm, flooding tide. At <b>2:50pm</b>, I noticed J-34 DoubleStuf by himself, and many small groups really spread out. One whale breached closer to South Beach, then many whales breached all over the place! I lost count of how many breached! A calf stuck its little head up as though trying to spy hop! Some tail lobs and whales rolling around showed active behaviors! The groups came closer together as they reached Salmon Bank, slowed down swimming toward Eagle Cove, as they often do. The sun reflected off their backs, and we give them lots of room when they are spread out like that, so hard to identify. We enjoyed watching all the active behaviors until about <b>4:15pm</b> and were able to ID that last group; J-16 Slick with her daughters J-36 Alki &amp; J-42 cute little Echo, and my personal favorite- her son J-26 Mike.

<b>6 pm</b>: During a quick scan of the waters in front of <b>Powell River</b>, the distinctive dorsals and splashes of around 
<b>60 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> foraging back and forth in front of the Mill got me to grab gear and head down to the skiff. The sun shining and calm waters was an extra bonus. The Dolphins were only interested in feeding, chasing fish close in to the Willingdon Beach shore. I stayed with them till around 9:20 pm when they suddenly exploded out of the water and made a B-line back towards the Mill then continued towards Lund. It was interesting to also see some terns picking off some of the excess feed.

Heading south out of Friday Harbor we headed further south towards <b>Smith Island</b> we encountered a pod of fast traveling <b>orcas</b>. This pod of killer whales (believed to be a mix of J and K pod) had everyone's attention as they displayed an array of exciting behaviors! A rambunctious younger member of the group was the first to breach! As the pod spread further apart they became even more active with several members of the group breaching, spyhopping, and kicking. At one point we even had a simultaneous breach from two of the pod members!

Barbara Bennett of the Island Co./WSU Beach Watchers reporting seeing whale spouts &amp; several boats with the <b>orcas</b>, near Ebey's Landing, <b>West Whidbey Island</b>, at around <b>12:40 pm</b>. It appeared the whales were moving closer to the Pt. Townsend side of the inlet a bit later.

On this first day of summer, about <b>9:15 AM</b> we just spotted multiple <b>orca </b>whales 200 yards or so from shore heading South down the Straits.  We are in the Nor'wester building at<b> NAS Whidbey Island</b>. At least 15-20 whales from the count we tried to do.  One was breeching and "dancing" for us; to our delight!

Many <b>J-Pod Orcas</b> with K-20 Spock (for a second I thought it was J-26 Mike- with her similar saddle patch &amp; tall dorsal fin! Maybe they have the same dad?!) and her son K-38 Comet formed 2 tight groups traveling north in Haro Strait, seeming to rest a bit, swimming slowly with the flooding tide. At about 3pm, they were off of Henry Island, taking their time heading to Stuart Island, then into Boundary Pass at 4:15pm. Their leisurely pace and breathing enabled us to identify J-22 Oreo with sons J-34 DoubleStuf &amp; J-38 Cookie, J-17- Princess Angeline with granddaughter J-46 Star, J-27 Blackberry with siblings J-31 Tsuchi &amp; J-39 Mako, and J-19 Shachi &amp; her daughter J-41 Eclipse.

First time sighting in <b>Clayoquot </b>- after 20+years that doesn't happen often. We had the <b>Alaskan (Transient orca) gang (T075s)</b> visit. They harassed a fur ball (Sea Otter) for a while but didn't kill it. They were oddly friendly in that they approached and circled 2 of the boats. Not totally sure if the bull was in fact T075A as a chunk is missing from the top trailing edge. Can anyone verify (see photo below)?

My husband and I were heading home (<b>Edmonds</b>) from Port Townsend at <b>2pm </b>on our boat, and saw we a lone <b>humpback </b>whale about 3 miles west of the Edmonds ferry terminal. We think he's probably a juvenile (he looked smaller than the ones we had seen in Hawaii).  He would glide on the surface 3 or 4 times, then we'd see his fluke and he'd go down for a few minutes. We watched him do this for a few times, then continued on our way home. It was spectacular.

We watched a <b>minke </b>whale just off Eagle Cove (near American Camp, south side of <b>San Juan Island</b>) feeding, mouth agape on the surface around noon.

We caught up to <b>J-pod</b> around Monarch Head on Saturna island. There were about six animals traveling very close to each other, and very close to shore. We even had some passengers capture the elusive 'spyhop' behavior on film. We stayed with the whales as they slowly traveled north in to the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>. We watched in silence for a while as we could hear the big male named 'Blackberry' take deep breaths. We would have stayed with the whales longer but they were leading us away from home, so we said our goodbyes and headed back to the harbor just in time to see a beautiful sunset!

The <b>Group B Js</b> headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. They were in a casual resting formation relatively close to shore for a while, then lingered near Kellett Bluff before continuing north. Even the little ones in the J17 family group were resting, but I think either J28 or J35 was spy hopping several times. Later, the K13s headed north along the west side of San Juan Island.  Although the Ks were initially well behind the Group B Js, I suspect they caught up with the Js near Kellett Bluff.
The Group A Js were bringing up the rear several hours later.  J2 Granny was in the lead, well ahead of the others in this group.  The rest trickled by, more or less in their family units.  I cannot say whether or not L87 was with them.

Out around the bend heading north along the west side of San Juan Island towards <b>False Bay</b>, we found the mother lode: <b>orcas</b>! Word through the vessel radio grapevine was that we had a mixture of J and K pods, with a possible identification of J30 ("Riptide"). One potential reason for resident pods to intermingle is to swap DNA and expand each pod's gene pool in hopes of creating viable and successful offspring; kind of important when you're an endangered species and on "THE LIST". Leaving the whales to their continued intermingling and love trysts, we cruised back along the west side to find an empty Bald eagles' nest at Long Island.

While traveling up the coast in a 40 ft sailing vessel we spotted a pod of <b>Orcas </b>apparently feeding. It was rough choppy waters, so we could not see what exactly they were eating. But their behavior was a darting back and forth through the water in one area as we went by - they were not migrating. There were <b>at least 6</b>, maybe more, and one orca that had a very prominent dorsal which was much larger than the others, I presume to be a male. Approximate location was about <b>200 yards off Cape Mendocino</b>.

As we rounded <b>Cattle Point</b> and came up along the west side (<b>San Juan Isl</b>) in some choppy waves, we were rewarded for our perseverance: <b>J-pod</b> was back from their few-day stint at sea. Spread out in a long line along the west coast, we watched the orcas travel in their smaller groups past Lime Kiln State Park.  One orca out on its own (Blackberry?) ceased hugging the coast and traveled out among the various whale watching vessels, breaching twice before continuing his meanderings.

Dave Ellifrit and Astrid van Ginneken of the Center for Whale Research began an encounter with Transient orcas at <b>12:35 p.m.</b> 3/4 of a mile west of <b>Blunden Island</b> (48 45.19 N, 123 10.80 W). <b>T123, T123A, and T123B</b> were traveling south at a medium speed. At <b>3:00 p.m</b>. the T123's were tight and traveling southwest at a medium speed. The encounter ended at 3:13 p.m. at 48 43.74 N,123 12.42 W.

Russ xxx reported lots of whales coming east through <b>Race Passage</b> at <b>1630</b>, traveling fast (7 knots) with the incoming tide in rough seas. Ken Balcomb and Mark Malleson responded in r/v "Shachi" at 1730 and encountered <b>J, K, and L pod subgroups</b> spread from about <b>Trial Island</b> to Seabird Point on Discovery Island (48 24.51N, 123 12.28W). The lead group included mostly K pod members, and subgroups of L pod followed, with J pod bringing up the rear and traveling most northward as the armada of whales swam toward the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> and False Bay. By the time they reached SJI, the whales were spread from about Eagle Point to Lime Kiln lighthouse, and some were catching salmon that were visible in their mouth, though regrettably the seas were too rough and dark to find scales for species identification. The fish in the mouth of Lxx was large enough to only be a Chinook, and we presume that was the species being hunted by the others. Before the light faded, Mark was able to get a photograph of the <b>new baby in L pod, L118</b> with its mother that Ken had barely photographed in February in Monterey Bay, California. The whales apparently spent the night foraging off the west side of San Juan Island, and on the morning ebb tide the J and L subgroups headed west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Today we got spoiled: we had a choice between two <b>transient killer whale pods</b>! The first group was called in as located off <b>Sidney Island</b> on the Canadian side of the Haro straight; a second pod was seen between <b>Saturna and South Pender Islands</b>. Once we caught up with this second group, we found that there were three animals in the pod: one male, one female and one calf. Even with lots of helpful eyes on the water, references to our transient catalog and chats with other vessels, we were not able to positively identify this pod. They showed some splashing and direction changes and then began heading west along South Pender Island.

Canadian Salish Sea waters today, by <b>Sydney and the D'Arcy Islands</b>! Another group of <b>4 Transient Killer Whales</b> using the strong flooding tide, heading north, at about <b>1:45pm</b>. They were swimming slowly in a fairly tight group, taking long dives, and like the ones yesterday, I wonder if they were resting a bit, letting that tide move them along? We indentified<b> T-10</b> with her son T-10A, and youngster T-10C. We also identified T-26, but I did not see her 21 year old T-26A, who was sighted the day before with this group.

We found <b>two Transient orcas</b> less than a mile outside <b>Moss Landing CA</b> today. They were porpoising out of the water probably chasing after something-- there were <b>bottlenose dolphins</b> just off the beach as well as some sea lions in the area. On our way in from our trip, I spotted them again, this time about 2.5 miles from the harbor entrance. These are the same two killer whales we had on May 6th who had hunted together and killed a harbor porpoise-- both days it was just these two with no others in sight. They surfaced just a few feet from our boat.

Just got back from the west side of San Juan Island - we caught a few of the whales as they passed by but missed others that had already passed the light. The whales were in classic CWR "Groups Spread Out" formation spread from a few hundred meters offshore to mid-Haro Strait. Whales and (groups) seen included (<b>K20, K38, K25, K27</b>), ...(<b>J17, J28, presumably J46 and J47</b>), (J27 plus presumed J31 and J39), and what was probably the J22s and J32. All of these whales headed north past <b>Lime Kiln</b>. 
Approximately 15 minutes later the K12s stalled out in front of the lighthouse. K22 and K33 milled and spyhopped around some kelp mats and K33 did a few tail lobs and pec slaps. K12, K37 and presumably K43 did similar social family stuff in their own little group and eventually they all joined up and headed south. We waited for the rest to cruise back south but by 2135 we didn't see anyone coming back from Bellevue.

No Resident Orcas today, yet around <b>1:35pm</b> we come across another group of <b>4 Transient Killer Whales</b>! A male T-56, with a female, juvenile and calf.

A group of <b>5 Transient orcas</b> were located heading west, just north of Portland Island. The group has been id'ed as <b>T10, T10B, T10C, T26, and T26A</b>. Shortly after we arrived at about <b>1230</b>, the group changed direction - a seal hunt was on. They took one seal, then logged on the surface for a short time before resuming the hunt for a second seal. The second seal was still alive when we left at approximately 13:30.

Today we left the harbor and headed north toward <b>Sucia Island</b>. Once there we spotted a small pod of <b>transients</b>. There were 3.  One female, one male, and one calf. They were taking long dives with a few breaths at their surface intervals before they dove again.  They were cruising along, with one quick stop that I thought might have been a hunting opportunity, but after a brief spyhop from the big male they continued along their merry way. When we first saw them they were on the east side of the island. When we left them it looked as though they were about to complete their circumnavigation as they turned the corner and headed up the west side.

Today we encountered <b>5 Transient Killer Whales</b>. I have rarely seen both residents and transients in the same area, ignoring each other, but I wonder if they do have a cosmic agreement in sharing the range? Ironic that so often, when the residents are out of range, then here come the transients! The transients are much less frequent, so harder to identify individuals. T-65A with a calf, juvenile, and 2 others off of <b>Wasp Passage</b> at about <b>12:30pm</b>. I noticed at least 1, maybe 2, had what appeared to me to be an open saddle patch; dark pigment going into the lighter patch. I wonder if anyone else saw and/or photographed that. I mention this, as a distinction of Transients was a closed saddle patch- no dark pigment, solid light patch on all of them. The whales headed west into <b>San Juan Channel</b>, staying closer to Orcas Island, although erratic surfacings after long dives in the pass, then they seemed to be hunting in the channel with circling, arching dives, and youngster tail flukes in the air! At 3pm they were still in San Juan Channel closer to Spieden Island. 
<br/>Caroline Armon, Marine Naturalist, SSAMN, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
Saw ladies - 3 adults and 1 calf - about 30 minutes outside of <b>Friday Harbor</b> this <b>morning</b>. We were so excited! We were told they were transients (due to the small grouping of only 4) and heard rumors later that they were the T-65's I think.

Caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye at <b>10:35 am</b> so quickly grabbed the binoculars just in time to see another blow and the half body porpoising move that's quite typical of a <b>Minke Whale</b> on the move. And then it was gone.
 Minke's are quite notorious for a few quick breaths then disappear for long periods to pop up quite a distance off. This one seemed to be on the move Northward just off Westview, <b>Powell River</b>.

Heading north in <b>Rosario Strait</b> we saw a <b>dolphin </b>by <b>Burrows Island, south Puget Sound</b>, heading west. I only saw it surface once but it came almost all the way out of the water and was definitely a dolphin, not a porpoise; not sure what kind but it looked kind of brownish. Maybe the lone common dolphin that was in Olympia a while back?

Mark from the fishing vessel "Greater Pacific" called this <b>afternoon </b>to report he saw <b>5 orcas</b>, 1 male, 2 females, 1 calf &amp; 1 juvenile, in <b>Monterey Bay</b>.  At first they were .5 mile out heading toward the Monterey Bay Harbor breakwall. Then turned to the shallow water and kelp line, headed past the Monterey Bay Aquarium, then toward the outer Bay red buoy at Pt. Pinos.

MONTEREY, Calif. - Keith Stemler, 47, of Monterey, was on a boat in <b>Monterey Harbor</b>, Wednesday, when <b>three gorgeous killer whales</b> swam by. Stemler was returning to the harbor after going on a salmon fishing trip with Chris' Fishing and Whale Watching. Suddenly, the pod of Orca whales surfaced just 15 feet away from the boat. Stemler grabbed his camera and caught the action.
"When I first spotted the Orcas I thought, 'Holy smokes, I scuba dive there,'" Stemler said. "I have seen Orcas many times in their natural environment. I have never seen them so close to the wharf area and San Carlos Beach."
<br/>*<br/> 
We had <b>four transient orca</b> (categorized as the T-65A's) come through <b>Deer Harbor, Orcas Island</b> right when we were pulling out of the marina. They came through a narrow passage called Pole Pass at low tide slack water. Today's low tide was one of the lowest tides of the year. Not only that but timing their transit of the pass when there was not any current running is a marvel of navigation. The current runs up to three to five knots through there on a normal tide. On today's tide it would be considerably stronger.

It's not great news when you hear that there are <b>Orcas </b>way west of <b>Victoria </b>going west. Could it have been J Pod, who were heard the evening before going North past SJI? <b>Transient Orcas</b> near <b>Yellow Island</b>, by Friday Harbor. And then another phone call! <b>Another group of five Transient Orcas</b>, the T75s, over near Sidney, BC, coming our way. We chose the pod near Sidney, and then with only one other boat, watched them glide lazily down Sidney Ch. toward D'Arcy Island. It was an incredibly beautiful evening.

<br/>*<br/>
Flat, calm, no wind, beautiful lighting, and thanks to the hockey game we were the only boat sitting off of <b>Sidney Island</b> with a pod of <b>5 transient orcas</b>.`There was one big male, one calf, one other juvenile and a couple of larger adults (at least one was a mom). They were swimming south, taking five minute dives, with long surface intervals when their behavior changed drastically. They dove and then surfaced inshore of where they were, disrupting a noisy, congregating group of birds. They milled at the surface for a few minutes and then turned and went back past us to where they originally were and proceeded to spend the next 40 minutes or so just milling. There was lots of rolling around at the surface, diving sideways, and at one point one of the adult females lifted the calf out of the water on her nose. We watched, stunned, with the engines off as the pod swam in circles, brushing up against one another, porpoising and rolling. Then two of the whales split away from the circle and things got a little bit strange. It was as if someone had just sped up the merry-go-round. The circling behavior continued, but more aggressively, with splashing, and speedy dives. Finally I figured out what was going on. A little harbor seal surfaced in the midst of the chaos. I was expecting a quick kill followed by a pool of blood, but instead the whales continued to circle the poor little seal for the next 10 minutes. He frantically looked up, then down, then back up as the whales continued to toy with him. The calf was apparently getting a little hunting lesson as he mimicked the adults behaviors to the tee. Finally we had to break away and head for home.  It was tough to leave and we continued to watch for as long as we could as we pulled away. We saw the little guy breach and then they were out of sight. It was a beautiful evening with amazing whales.

<b>J-Pod</b> heading from <b>Whidbey Island</b> toward the south end of <b>Lopez</b>, about <b>1:15pm</b>. We watched J-Pod with L-53 Lulu and L-87 Onyx, spread out in 4 groups, with J-2 Granny in the lead again! Looked like newest calf J-47 in the next group. Interesting that J-26 Mike and J-27 Blackberry were in the last group again, with L-53, and the NOAA vessel following, trying to deploy the suction attached short term D-tags. Again, this last group of Orcas dipped into Cattle Pass slowed down, showing how strong they are against the huge currents, with tail fluke slaps, a few breaches, and spy hops. A male also showed "pink floyd", so mating with L-53 going on? As we headed up Cattle Pass at about 3pm, the whales increased their speed around Goose Island and Cattle Point to catch up with the rest of the clan off South Beach.

At <b>3:30 PM</b>, part of <b>J-Pod</b> was passing <b>Lime Kiln Point State Park</b> heading north. About 15 minutes later, they turned around and headed back south. Several whales, including <b>J19 Shachi, J41 Eclipse, J40 Suttles, and L53 Lulu</b> thrilled visitors by coming right into the cove next to the lighthouse. I also was able to identify J8 Spieden and L87 Onyx well offshore. The whales continued south, where they foraged in the currents off of Land Bank until about 5:30. Word was that the rest of J-Pod was still further south in Haro Strait.

<br/>*<br/> 
We headed south toward <b>S. Rosario</b> in search of <b>J-pod</b>. We saw lots of Harbor Porpoise in SJ Channel on the way. By the time we arrived on scene the whales had turned West and were traveling along the south end of Lopez. They were spread out but in nice tight groups of 3 to 6 whales. We spotted L53, J19 &amp; J41 traveling together at first. Then L53 hooked up with J8 (Spieden est. 78 yrs) and J2 (Granny est. 100 yrs )for some Speed Swimming (see JB's photo below). Pretty amazing to see the powerful energy of these 2 senior ladies! We paralleled different groups of whales at 200+ yards to Cattle Pass. We had nice encounters with J17, J35 and their calves J44 &amp; J47. Watched L87 for awhile, and then saw a group of approximately 8 whales including J27 and J26 get pushed into Cattle Pass by the huge flood tide. By the time they crossed from Lopez to San Juan they were north of Goose Island. At one point the whales were swimming south, but moving north. Eventually they got in the lee of Goose Island and made their way back out and around Cattle Point.

J2 Granny and J8 Speiden were together at the head of the pack; the whole group was very spread out until someone did a bunch of tail lobbing (Granny?

<br/>*<br/>
We met the first of <b>J-pod</b> at South Beach and watched as they hauled north toward <b>Eagle Point</b>, with some porpoising at the fast pace. On our way back toward Friday Harbor the rest of the pod came into view as we approached Cattle Point. This lagging group was full of youngsters and moving in a tighter formation, but slower pace. There were two mature males present that I believe were Blackberry (J-27) and Mike (J-26). The newest additions to the pod appeared to be practicing their lob tails, repeating the action shortly after their elders would do so. Afterwards they took turns breaching, with one member coming completely out of the water three consecutive times!

Erick Pierson called at <b>11:53 am</b> with <b>J's</b> and possibly some <b>L's</b>, in Rosario Strait headed south, some only 1/4 mile from shore but spread out over about 5 miles, almost to <b>Partridge Pt., Whidbey Island</b>. At <b>12:12 pm</b> Granny made a hard turn NW toward Haro Strait, did a few tail lobs, and the rest of the pod followed and turned as well, so looks like they may be heading back up to San Juan Island (unless they change directions again soon).

Ken Balcomb and Gale Richard met up with members of <b>J Pod, L87, and L53</b> in front of the Center for Whale Research (48 37.48 N, 123 12.46 W) on Shachi. Shortly after Erin Heydenreich, Candice Calloway-Whiting, and Candice Smith had a follow up encounter on Orca. The second encounter began at <b>12:48 PM</b> and followed <b>J Pod, and L53</b>. The whales were spread out and traveling at a medium speed. The encounter ended at <b>4:56 PM</b> off the west coast of Stuart Island (48 40.15 N, 123 13.78 W).

Off of Deadman Bay, in <b>Haro Strait</b>, a school group of kids, (and all the grown ups!) were thrilled to see <b>J-Pod Orcas</b>. Another strong flooding tide and the whales spread out in 4 active groups, with J-2 Granny in the lead. From about <b>1:45 to 3 pm</b>, as they headed north, the Orcas also breached, spy hopped, tail fluke slapped the surface, and some made direction changes as though fishing. J-27 Blackberry and J-26 Mike were together. They are now the eldest males in J-Pod, at 20 years old.

<b>9:45 am:</b> A lone <b>Humpback Whale</b> was Southbound at <b>Race Point</b>. It was first thought to be a Gray Whale, but later confirmed it was a large Humpback. At 11:30 am it was around Duncan Bay, Discovery Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
Word was whales were headed north... no, wait... south... no, wait... north!  A pod of indecisive <b>orcas</b>! Yes, northbound for sure along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. As we rounded the northernmost point of San Juan Island, one by one, we saw large black dorsal fins belonging to none other than, you guessed it, <b>J-pod</b>! They were still in the neighborhood and we were able to catch up with them as they traveled towards Canadian waters. We found the rear ten to fifteen individuals of the 27-animal pod and observed them as they tail slapped, pectoral fin slapped and upside down tail slapped. One of the pod members even spy-hopped four times, each time nearly revealing pectoral fins. When a whale of any species does this maneuver--bringing its head and often even eyes up out of the water as it remains vertically positioned--it is considered a curious behavior. This leads scientists and whale watchers alike to consider: are the whales curiously watching us?

I was out with Island Adventures today. We caught up with <b>J Pod</b> at about <b>Lime Kiln</b>, heading north. We left them at Kellett Bluff. They were resting in three groups  - with Granny in the lead. Hurray! The conditions were amazing - warm sun, flat water. So, the sight of the whales surfacing and breathing together was extra spectacular. We saw an occasional breach, spy hop and tail lob. But, mostly, they appeared to be resting. Ken B (Center for Whale Research) was in the middle of things and I expect he got some really great photos. Can't wait to see them. We also saw lots and lots of harbor porpoise in Guemes Channel and a few Dall's Porpoise as we approached the whales at Lime Kiln. Beautiful day on the water!

Over the weekend we were able to get some photos of a <b>common dolphin</b> that has been sighted off <b>Boston Harbor lighthouse</b>, near Olympia since 5 June. Upon comparing these photos to photos sent to us a week ago, we found that they were different animals. This is consistent with one early report of 2 dolphins, and the more recent reports of 1. It is possible that the missing dolphin did not make it, so please be on the alert for reports of unusual stranded animal in the south sound.

While hiking on a beautiful sunny day, around <b>Cattle Point</b> Lighthouse around <b>1 pm</b>, surprise! Three tight groups of <b>Orcas </b>are heading past Lopez toward South Beach. The first 2 groups swam past pretty fast, but the 3rd group dipped into Cattle Pass. The NOAA research vessel, trying to deploy D-tags was right with them. We were able to identify J-27 Blackberry, J-34 DoubleStuf, J-16 Slick with youngster J-42 Echo. I thought they would probably head up <b>Haro Strait</b> with the flooding tide, and sure enough
we saw them on the west side and traveling north past Lime Kiln Point State Park! Two hours of great views from San Juan Island!

Today on both of our trips, we encountered <b>J-pod</b>. First off of the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> where they were headed northeast and then off of East point, the most northwestern point of the United States, and headed into Canadian waters. Our whales went international today, visiting a few countries along the way. Within the pod, we were able to identify Mike (J26). With Mike, we found his mother J16 (Slick); she has a little stripe of white coming off her saddle patch towards her dorsal fin making her somewhat recognizable. Two other animals were with this sub-group, possibly Slick's children Echo and Alki. Bringing up the rear of J-pod was Blackberry (J27). And with him were about five to six other orcas, potentially his family. And following behind Blackberry and crew were... humans  A research group with NOAA was out tagging whales again, trying to understand what the whale hear and the sounds in their environment.

Group of kayakers paddling from James Island to Washington Park <b>Rosario Strait; orca pod</b> seen approximately ½ mile west of Green Point, by Washington Park. GPS coordinates for where we rafted up were: N48.29.957 W122.43.235. We were watching one male(?) traveling close to the shore. After he moved out of sight we started again for Washington Park. Another whale surprised us be surfacing close to the kayaks. We rafted together and watched as several small groups of orcas passed by us heading south around Burrows and Allen Islands  We counted approximately 10-12 orcas and there seemed to be a small one. They were traveling quite spread out across the strait (ie. a large wide group, not following single file). This was approximately <b>10:15am</b>. They seemed to be traveling. One breeched but the others only surfaced to breathe as they were swimming. Other than the first orca close to shore, we saw one other rather large fin in the group. We encountered orcas in Rosario Strait once before, approx 2 years ago, on the south side of James Island. They were quite far away that time. Unfortunately all efforts to get a picture were unsuccessful. Also wanted to mention that there didn't seem to be any boats following this group or any boats in the area, in fact only one motor boat even noticed the first orca, and he stopped his engine to let him swim through.

<b>Two Transient Orca</b> Encounters with the same group: After entering Bute Inlet, <b>1 pm</b> we saw the second group of <b>5 Transient Orca</b> headed against the tidal rapids at Aaron Rapids. As Jack put it "an Orca Jacuzzi" with the whirlpools running. They were taking their time going through, when a little Harbour Seal drifted in, never noticing that he was headed straight into these meat hunters. The orca had their snack. The whales made it through the narrows, down past Sonora Lodge then turned back up into Bute Inlet to do it again. Around 2:45 pm they took, in spectacular fashion, I'm told, a Harbour Porpoise, again in Aaron Rapids.

Gray whales (?) having fun splashing around just south of our house, west of <b>mutiny bay</b>. Out pretty far but busy at the surface, lots of spouts and wallowing around. We could see 4 at one time all playing close together.
I thought maybe humpbacks cause they were so long, but I didn't know we were getting them already. 4 maybe more, which made me think maybe grays after all...anybody's guess. They were too far to see close except with binocs and telescope.
<br/>Barbara Mundell, Bush Pt, Freeland, <b>Whidbey Island</b>, WA 
<br/><i>hmmm - hard to tell on this one. Usually splashing/wallowing behavior is only seen by Gray whales when they are feeding close to shore in shallow water; and we have had very few Grays reported lately, I don't think there are more than 2 left around these waters now...however, there HAVE been several reports of 1 or 2 humpbacks in the area, especially around Mutiny and Useless Bays, near where this sighting took place.

Reports of <b>L-Pod orcas</b> south of <b>San Juan Island</b>, and <b>J-Pod orcas</b> heading north with the small flood tide in <b>Haro Strait</b>, led us through Spieden Channel where we started to see whales right about <b>1pm</b>! Now it was slack water, the whales where swimming leisurely in tight groups, I wonder if they were resting a bit. As they approached the south end of Stuart Island they began to spread out, become more active. A young killer whale spy hopped, then the youngsters started breaching about 8 times (see photo below), with 2 of the whales coming out of the water at the same time, leaving twin splashes!! They did this twice! A few tail fluke slaps as they swam closer to shore. Then <b>J-27</b> Blackberry and a female starting circling, making several direction changes, hunting for salmon! At Turn Point, the orcas decided to go right, into Boundary Pass, we left them heading northeast. Able to ID <b>J-17, J-22 with J-38 &amp; J-32, J-27, J-34, J-28, J-14, J-26</b>.

In looking at my images I discovered that <b>Lulu L-53</b> was one of the whales in close to shore traveling with some of the J pod whales. Of course Onyx L87 was still with J pod later to the north, but Lulu was not with them, so she was most likely one of the two who came south past the light.

We soon found a large pod of orcas who turned out to be <b>J-pod</b>! Rather than traveling at a quick pace, they were spread out and swimming in smaller groups towards the east. With passengers' photos, we were able to identify two males--Mike and Blackberry--and a female, Spieden. We saw the whales breaching and even a spy-hop from one particularly curious individual. While we were out with the whales, we learned that a research group had just placed a suction-cup tag on the male J-30, Riptide and were hoping to put a tag on a second whale.

Noticing some sailboats clustering in <b>Shilshole Bay</b> (N of Seattle, WA) about <b>6:30 tonight</b>, our daughter spotted a dorsal fin using our spotting scope. My wife and I also watched the orca, appearing to be a small female or youngster, for a period of time. Definitely too big for Dall's porpoise, and had the shape of a female dorsal fin. Since there was only one orca fin visible, we wonder whether this may not have been a <b>transient</b>, which might have been attracted by our considerable colony of sea lions. Another craft in the immediate area appeared to be a monitoring vessel. More orcas to come, we hope!

We headed out on our 10am tour and made our way towards <b>Constance Bank</b> after receiving a report of <b>a lone Male Orca</b> being seen in that area at <b>8.30am</b> by one of the local fishing charters. Then we received a report that <b>T20 &amp; T21</b> had been sighted north of Beaumont Shoals, so off we headed in that direction. As we arrived on scene just off Lime Kiln we witnessed the two Transient Orcas make a kill, their prey this time being a Harbor Porpoise. We sat for several minutes as the T20 &amp; T21 devoured the Porpoise between them and then headed off towards Kelp Reef!

From there we headed across the border at <b>Boundary Pass</b> and had everyone on board helping us look for signs of <b>orca</b>.

We were very delighted to see <b>J-Pod</b> orcas heading west, with the small ebbing tide in <b>Boundary Pass</b>, closer to Saturna Island, Canada, at about <b>1:45pm</b>. They were spread out from shore to about halfway out in the pass. J-2 Granny was in the lead, all by herself. Happy 100th Birthday! and poignant seeing her without J-1 Ruffles. Following J-2, I think J-8 Spieden was in the next group of 2 to 3 killer whales with J-26 Mike. The wonderful sunshine reflected off of their backs, making it hard to identify saddle patches. There were 2 more males with groups out in the pass, then J-30 Riptide with a calf and 2 females swam near shore and looked like they may be hunting salmon in the reef-rock rips as they circled a bit and the youngster did a tail fluke slap. It's close to <b>3pm </b>now, time to head back, when the calf spy hops and breaches!

Once through the pass we cruised straight out toward <b>salmon bank</b>. A <b>minke whale</b> surfaced next to an aggregation of birds, undoubtedly stealing away a portion of their hard earned fish. We watched as the sleek, stealthy animal surfaced a few more times and then slid below the surface. We observed a second minke surface about a half a mile further out. They changed direction with every dive and were constantly on the move.

I saw what I believe was a <b>Minke whale</b>. It was in the Canadian waters between <b>Port Angeles and Victoria</b> in the vicinity of Coyote Bank. It was feeding, heading in an easterly direction. There were also lots and lots (perhaps 150) of harbor porpoises between Victoria and Anacortes.

We had reports of a <b>humpback </b>out off <b>Constance Bank</b>. It didn't take long for the massive adult to come to the surface, and the long blows would echo across the water. But unlike my previous experiences with humpbacks, this one would take 2 short dives, dive for about a minute or two and then surface again (see photo below). It was almost as if it were in some type of resting pattern, as it made very little headway in it's travel. Too soon it was time to head back, but we did manage to find some time to compare this Mysticete with another--a <b>minke whale</b> that was actively feeding near <b>Salmon Bank</b>.

We headed out toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca on glassy, calm water. After an hour of eye-straining binocular use a blow appeared in the distance. A large, dark body rose to the surface. My old friend the <b>humpback </b>whale. Knowing the humpback's penchant for lengthy dives I started to explain the incredible breath holding abilities of the species. Just then, as if to prove me wrong, the whale surfaced. On the way back in we spotted another black body at the surface. This time there was no visible exhalation, which could only mean...<b>minke</b>. Species number two! As we were moving in for a better look a <b>second Minke</b> surfaced about 200 yards off our starboard side.

We encountered at least <b>80-100 Harbor porpoises</b> feeding amidst feeding puffins in the current right of the south-east end of <b>Lopez Island, WA</b> from <b>16:50 - 17:40</b>. The number is even conservative! (I have counted harbor porpoises for my PhD work in Norway over 6 years almost every day). The porpoises were very active, leaping and spread over at least a 1 mile area - quite impressive activity for those little guys. Those group feeding events are really fun to listen to if you have a porpoise detector - lots of buzzing activity (those buzzes are really very fast click trains just before they actually catch a fish). I just thought you might want to know about this event anyway - all the best,

Getting further south from the <b>Haro Strait</b> into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, we started to see seabirds. Then more and more seabirds. And with those seabirds there were <b>Minke whales</b>! With the perfectly flat calm water and light breezes, we could hear the Minke's exhale.  All in all we saw <b>four whales</b>, with six reported in the area (one off of Lopez Island and three to five off of Salmon bank). Based on their zigzagging travel motions and their head and rostrum rises, the Minke whales appeared to be foraging, sharing fish with the seabirds. On the way home, we saw steller sea lions, harbor seals and several more harbor porpoises.

<br/>*<br/>
We motored out to Salmon Bank and then <b>Hein Bank</b>, areas known for schools of herring and, subsequently, birds and marine mammals feeding on the abundant food source. A female and calf <b>Minke </b>whale were seen by other vessels in the area. At Hein Bank, we spotted <b>several more Minkes</b> nearby. One curious creature passed within 120 yards of our vessel, bringing its rostrum--the top of its head--out of the water a few times. It's rare that we glimpse more than the dorsal fin of a Minke whale!  Despite an absence of sea birds, it is possible that these Minkes were foraging.  In total, there were <b>four animals</b> spread out over several hundred yards.  <b>Harbor porpoises</b> made themselves known on our trip as well, though for just a quick glimpse of a gray dorsal fin or two.

I saw a resident pod of <b>orcas</b>. There were at least 10 near <b>Hobart Bay, AK</b> near the five fingers lighthouse. I had a large male and a baby or two at one point.  there were several Dall'sporpoises swimming a few feet in front of and behind for at least 5 minutes. That led us to believe that they were not transients as the porpoises had no fear and seemed to be playing.

About <b>4:30 PM</b> we again had a <b>gray whale</b> feeding close to shore on the high tide. I had been gone all day and as I drove in the driveway the neighbor alerted me that there was a gray whale feeding off our bluff. The light  was just  right to really seeing the rolling motion as it would blow, then roll on its side to feed, with much pec waving. After an extended snack, the whale then headed south rapidly, only to stop and feed again in a favorite spot several lots down.
