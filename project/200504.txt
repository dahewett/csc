<br/>
<b>April 30, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Hood Canal <b>Orcas</b> were sighted across the Canal from Hama Hama Oyster Company. They were headed South at <b>6:40 p.m</b>. At times they appeared to be feeding.
<br/>Mina Kyle
<br/>Hood Canal
<br/>*<br/>
Went scuba diving in Hood Canal, at a place called elephant Wall, south of Pleasant Harbor Marina. On the way back into the Marina we saw the Slippery Six!!!! (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) close in to shore, spyhopping, etc.  ALOT of movement in one area...circling, diving, jumping (the little ones) etc.  We think they were feeding but if so, then their prey was already under water by then. Watched for about 40 minutes until <b>2:30 p.m</b>. when they left.  Pleasant harbor is north of Ayock point where they were seen yesterday in the evening.
<br/>Jeanette Dalton
<br/>*<br/>
Tom Berry called to report he had sighted the Hood Canal Transients at <b>7:40 pm</b>, across from Eagle creek heading south. One of the whales appeared to have an orange buoy caught on its fin at one point, but when he saw the whale later, it looked like the buoy was gone.
<br/>*<br/>
I spotted a pod of <b>Orcas</b> on Saturday at <b>6pm</b>. They were heading slowly West, just south of Rum and Gooch Islands (just west of Haro Strait) before they turned and slowly made their way north. I was on Rum Island so I was too far away to get any good photos for ID's. They were quite spread out, but there were at least 10-15 of them I'd guess. A few tail slaps but otherwise they were having a relaxing swim at an easy pace.

<b>April 29, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Janet Rogers reported seeing what sounded like a <b>gray</b> off her house, north of Golden Gardens Park in Seattle at <b>7:30Am</b>. Beth has since heard reports of a gray off Carkeek Park the next couple of days. 
<br/>Fred Felleman 
<br/>Seattle
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:15 PM,</b> Three gray whales (one of them is "Patch") are feeding in
front of Langley. At one point they were all right next to each other and
all had their fins and half a fluke up and then they rolled and breathed
together- what a show!
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>JPod</b> south of Victoria most of the <b>afternoon</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 2 <b>grays</b>, one of them "Patch", between Camano Head &amp; Hat Island, heading toward Hat Island at <b>3 pm</b>. There were also 2 other grays on the other side of Hat Island going toward Clinton.
<br/>*<br/>
Gail Fleming of Langley reported 2 <b>grays</b>, mid-channel in south Saratoga Passage heading south between <b>1:30 and 2 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
John Herman reported 1 adult &amp; 1 juvenile <b>gray</b> whale 1/2 mile south of Possession Pt, S. Whidbey at <b>12:45 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Debbie Larsen called to report seeing what appeared to be 2 <b>orca</b> fins in Hales Passage, north of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge at approx. <b>noon</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
1 mile North of Hama Hama Oyster Company at Hyw. mile marker 319, I spotted the "Slippery Six" (Hood Canal <b>Orcas</b>) at <b>11:50 a.m</b>. Only have seen 3 Orcas. They were headed south.
<br/>Mina Kyle
<br/>*<br/>
My husband and I were out in our boat today on the Hood Canal and had quite a show with the Slippery Six (HC <b>Transients</b>). We entered the Hood Canal at Triton Public launch at <b>10:15 a.m</b>. and started heading south toward the great bend. We hadn't been out 5 minutes and spotted the Orcas. They were heading south down the Canal, playing and jumping and flapping their tales. We stayed with them for an hour and 45 minutes. They stayed close to the west side of the canal and then about 12:00 p.m. (noon) they started to head towards the middle and also started moving quickly towards the Potlach area.
<br/>Stephen &amp; Emmie Miller
<br/>*<br/>
there was a young (sub adult?) <b>gray</b> whale that I haven't seen before feeding in front of Langley this morning around <b>6:15 AM</b>. It headed back northwest at about 6:30.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>12:30 am</b>, I hear our 6 coming back this way, along the west side of the Canal this time, almost below us. Tide was low, so they couldn't have been in too close...I listened for about 45 minutes as they slowly made their way toward Hoodsport.

<br/><br/>
<b>J Pod</b> was cruising leisurely westbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca at about <b>1500</b> hrs. J2 &amp; J1 were in the lead, then the rest of the pod paraded by singly or in mother/calf pairs. J14 (Samish) came right over to our parked boat with J40 right beside her. The calf rolled on its back and gave several of our passengers an excellent view of "her" belly. From photos of male/female belly patches, they picked the female form. We'll see if the Centre for Marine Mammal Research can confirm this in the future. In any case, it appears to be a spunky, healthy little calf.
<br/>Joan Lopez  
<br/>Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>7:20 pm</b>, 1.5 miles South of Hoodsport, about 100' above the Milepost 333 on Hwy. 101, west side of the Canal, when I caught the gilmmer of the fading sun bouncing off the fins of our 6 Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> slippery gals as they transited in tight formation along the east side of the Canal, heading south. They disappeared, then reappeared, still in formation, just off Bald Point. Looked like they were making a beeline for the Skok River flats where all the seals hang out.
<br/>Lindon Sheldon
<br/>Potlatch, Hood Canal, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Watched a <b>gray</b> last night in Sinclair Inlet. It was out in front of the marinas. 
<br/>Bill Van Fleet
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>Js</b> headed away from shore, south of Lime Kiln, going southeast, toward Hein Bank, <b>1900</b> hrs. Very playful, after a lot of foraging.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J's</b> on the west side (San Juan Is.) this <b>afternoon</b> going North.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
Derick Whitmarsh called at <b>5:40 pm</b> to report one <b>gray</b> whale close in to Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island (across from Langley) heading north.
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Hollywood called with an update of 1 <b>gray</b> whale on the north side of Hat Island at <b>2:38 pm</b>, headed toward Tulalip Bay.
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Hollywood reported <b>gray</b> whales in mid-Possession Sound, 2 miles south of Hat Island headed toward Sandy Pt. at <b>12:54 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
The Hood Canal <b>transients</b> passed by the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab today about ½ mile offshore heading south @ <b>10:11 am</b>. 
<br/>Brian McLaughlin, Fisheries Biologist
<br/>Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife
<br/>*<br/>
We had 3 and a possible 4 <b>Grays</b> feeding in front of Spee-Bi-Dah at <b>9:00 am</b>. They continued to feed for about 20-25 minutes. One was "Trim Tail". One of the others was "Patch". We have not seen any for at least 2/3 weeks.
<br/>Malcolm &amp; Tarry Lindquist
<br/>Spee-Bi-Dah 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>8:30 AM</b> I was treated to another sighting of the <b>grey</b> that has been hanging around South Sound. This morning he seems to be staying between Stretch and Reach Islands (47. 20. 072 N  122.49.385 W) which is fairly shallow, running at about 8 - 9 fathoms. He blows every few minutes and seems to be circling within the area. He has also (I have been told) passed behind Reach Island, through the shallows of Fair Harbor. When the grays do visit here, they seem to always spend time in Fair Harbor during the upper end of the incoming tide.

<b>April 27, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
I had the pleasure of spending time watching a <b>grey</b> with lots of white barnacles on fluke roll and feed amazingly close to shore between <b>6:30 and 7 pm</b>, right off the langley shore north of town by the spit. So shallow that breathing was from above water with just a few deeper dives and blows. I was worried about stranding, but the whale was fine and swam off diving and blowing, going south at about 7.
<br/>Heather Ogilvy
<br/>Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
Just wanted to pass on that a <b>Grey</b> Whale (with white patches on the flukes and tail) swam slowly passed Langley and very close to shore, heading south from about <b>7:00 pm to 7:45 pm</b>.
<br/>Joe Alicea
<br/>*<br/>
During high tide, at <b>7:20 PM</b> one <b>gray</b> whale  was feeding very close to shore (less than 25 feet out), in downtown Langley. The whale was slowly making his/her way eastward through Saratoga Passage, headed for Sandy Point.
<br/>Deborah  Houseworth 
<br/>Clinton
<br/>*<br/>
Joe Alicea called to report one <b>gray</b> whale in mid-Saratoga Passage at <b>6:45 pm</b>, heading south toward Langley.
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Maya of Maya's charters reported <b>J pod</b> at Henry Island, headed north at a fast pace at <b>6:30 pm</b>. They had been seen as far south as Cattle Pass earlier in the day.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Early morning</b> reports of <b>J Pod</b> down at Cattle Point, and then around <b>6:00 PM</b>, orcas (J-Pod again?) were heading North past Sunset Point towards Henry Island. One breach as the sun was turning the water orange was a nice ending to my day.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Jpod</b> came together this afternoon off the South End of San Juan Island, some breeches, cartwheels, spyhops and just playing. The last few days J1 and J2 have been as much as 3+ miles away from the rest. Whales going North off Kellet Bluff this evening.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>3:00 PM</b> we spotted a (<b>gray</b>) whale traveling mid channel, Saratoga Passage heading north. Also included a whale was feeding in front of Langley at about <b>7:30 PM</b> this evening and heading south.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Didn't see them, but at <b>2:00 PM</b>, I heard that <b>J-Pod</b> was at Cattle Point heading Southwest.
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We watched a lone <b>Gray</b> for about 20 min off the North end Hat (Gedney) Is. headed toward Camano Head on the 27th at about noon. He/she was moving at about 3-4 kts blowing about every 15-20 seconds. The whale was raising length of body out of water every 5-7 blows and showing tail then diving for 2-3 min before surfacing and starting cycle again. Feeding?
<br/>Bill &amp; Cathie Barnes
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
From approx <b>5:15 PM to 5:45 PM</b> I followed 2 <b>gray</b> whales along the beach south of Mabana, heading NW. The 2 grays fed on the flats about 100 ft off shore on an incoming tide. A third <b>Gray</b> could be seen further out in the Passage. 
<br/>Barbara Brock 
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>8:20 pm</b> I was on my deck on Cougar Spit (East side of Hood Canal, across from Hoodsport). I could hear the <b>Orcas</b> breathing. I spotted one big black fin. I can't say what direction they were headed as our visuals were brief.
<br/>Brad Lambert
<br/>Cougar Spit, Hood Canal
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw what we believe to be a <b>grey</b> whale traveling past our home on Zangle cove, <b>~5:30 pm</b>. It continued North on Dana passage (heading toward) Tacoma. We heard it before we saw it. Loud sound of blow hole then watched it surface and go back under. Surfaced four times over a period of about 15-20 minutes. We could still hear it long after we could see it. It was too far away to catch any marked characteristics.
<br/>Caroline Bell
<br/>*<br/>
Pam Trojanoski reported 3 <b>grays</b> feeding off the south end of Camano Island at <b>4 pm</b>, heading NW.
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Jim Maya of Maya's Charters reported <b>J pod</b> in the middle of the Straits of Georgia at <b>3:15 pm</b>, about 5 miles out from Active Pass, headed toward the Fraser River. Lots of jumping &amp; activity.
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>gray</b> whale in Olympia harbor, <b>1300</b>, headed southbound.
<br/>Jim Hanson, Harbor Patrol Volunteer
<br/>Olympia
<br/>*<br/>
The Hood Canal <b>transients</b> were across Dabob Bay from the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab today @ <b>1210</b>. There was lots of breaching, spy hopping, and tail slapping. Many gulls were present. They were over there for about 45 minutes. Then they moved to the center of the bay where I saw them toss a harbor seal into the air twice. Then they continued south and out of sight around the point.
<br/>Brian McLaughlin
<br/>Fisheries Biologist
<br/>Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>grays</b> at <b>6:30 am until 7:45</b> feeding at Mabana on Camano (W. side) They remained close together the entire time. One slightly larger than the other. One heavily barnacled. They do find these tide flats a great place for food.
<br/>Dodie Markey
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
David Defriest called to report a pod of orcas off Poplar Beach, in Halfmoon Bay, CA.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 25, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
Was sitting in my living room (above HWY 101, south of the old Rayonier Lab, on the west side of Hood Canal across from Mesquiti Point), when I heard VERY distinct blows, large and small, from right below us. The popping noise turned out to be tail slapping. The Slippery Six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) were back! Grabbed my husband and dog and we went out on the lawn, where we heard a great amount of activity between <b>10:10 and 1020 pm</b> - INCLUDING DISTINCT ORCA CALLS (no mistaking gulls for them this time -- no gulls at all anywhere near). We listened till about 10:35 pm, when we had to get back, regretfully leaving them within earshot, but traveling north toward Lilliwaup.
<br/>Linda Sheldon
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Maya of Maya's Charters reported <b>J pod</b> spread out 1/2 - 3 miles offshore the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, west San Juan Island, heading south toward False Bay at <b>6 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Gail Fleming reported 1 <b>gray</b> whale (the white finned-waver) just north of Sandy Pt, south Saratoga Passage, feeding close to shore at <b>5 pm.</b>
<br/>*<br/>
We were on Maple Beach (south of Scenic Beach State Park) and saw the <b>Transients</b>, just North of Pleasant Harbor, about mid channel at about <b>4:30 P.M</b>. They were heading north. We saw 3 come up and then two. They headed toward Toandos peninsula and then turned East and appeared to continue north towards Bangor. 
<br/>Mike Montgomery
<br/>Seabeck Shores
<br/>*<br/>
We had a good day with the Hood Canal <b>transients</b>. Found them before <b>9 AM</b> mid-channel north of Dewatto Bay, heading south. They proceeded south along the east shoreline and around the great bend. One probable kill (presumably a harbor seal) just at the bend, then a chase of a harbor seal that got away by moving quickly into shallow water just to the east. At that point the whales turned and re-traced their path northbound. Just north of Lilliwaup Bay they encountered a male California sea lion, and began an extended period trying to kill it. While being battered, the sea lion slowly made its way towards the western shoreline, and made it to a shallow water refuge right offshore. At that stage the whales turned south and we left them southbound around <b>3 PM</b> about half a mile north of Musqueti Point.

<br/>*<br/>
Finally got a chance to see the <b>J pod</b> this year. They were moving slowly, spread out, and offshore between Pile Point and Lime Kiln around <b>1400</b> today. Had a nice spyhop from J34!

<br/>*<br/>
Just got a call, <b>1230</b>, from my brother, who has spotted <b>Orcas</b>, probably J Pod near Eagle Pt., southwest side, San Juan Is., headed up island. There were at least six.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
It was about <b>12:30 pm</b> just south of Dewatto that I saw Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>.
<br/>Carol &amp; Wayne Fassett
<br/>*<br/>
Joyce Bettingfield reported the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at Hoodsport, straight out from the Winery at <b>11:05 am.</b>
<br/>*<br/>
Robin Baird of Cascadia Research called at <b>8:50 am</b> to report they'd found the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>, southbound mid-channel off Dewatto. He will send a report after their day of observation.
<br/>*<br/>
There were at least two <b>gray</b> whales feeding in front of Langley last night at <b>3 AM</b>.

<br/><br/>
Case Inlet, South Puget Sound was visited by a mature <b>grey</b> whale, who stayed through the late night...the whale was alone, and feeding. He fed between Stretch Island and Key Peninsula (Vaughn Bay). My friend told me that he spotted a <b>grey</b> (presumably the same one) just west of Hope Island, heading north up Pickering Passage late yesterday morning. I am assuming it is the same one.

<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>5:00 PM</b> the slippery six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) are slowly working their way north just NE of Misery Point. They have been playing there for about 15 minutes.
<br/>Bill Juneau
<br/>Seabeck
<br/>*<br/>
The Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> made a rare visit to Seabeck today. Around <b>4pm</b> they passed by Maple Beach and Scenic Beach State Park headed north, close to the Kitsap County side. They stopped to make a kill at Oak Head, the tip of the Toanados Peninsula. The Slippery Six put on a show spyhopping, tail slapping and lots of rolling. Instead of their usual route back up into Dabob Bay, we watched them continue their course north. We lost sight of them rounding the corner of Toanados towards Bangor at around <b>5pm</b>.
<br/>Kathy Cole
<br/>Seabeck, Maple Beach
<br/>*<br/>
Five <b>orcas</b> were seen off Misery Point (Hood Canal), heading North. They were about midway between Misery Pt. and the end of the Toandos peninsula.
There appeared to be 5 in the pod, and variously appeared to be feeding,
playing, and traveling at a leisurely pace. We saw some breeching, and
slapping the water with their tails.

Elaine Wiley of Gypsy Cove, Hood Canal called to report the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> in mid-channel, just south of Ayok Pt, closer to the east side at <b>11:45 am</b>, headed north slowly. All present, &amp; active. One boat there, not approaching too close......and more emailed in later: 
The Hood Canal Slippery Six spent a good 1/2 hour just south of Ayock Point - they started out in the middle and then went more to the east side. The water was really calm so it was amazing to see what they were doing. They were tail flipping - rolling and jumping out of the water have a great time. Did not look like they made any kills - just having fun.

It was approx. <b>10:30 am</b> today 4/24 that I spotted the slippery six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) just north of Dewatto Bay. VERY playful today. All were breaching, tail slapping, and rolling. I lost site from my viewing sight at approx. 11:30 and they were still heading north.  They did slack off on the playfulness when a boat came speeding up on them but did not halt all together.

Lone <b>gray</b> whale came close to shore on the incoming tide Saturday, at about <b>3:15 pm</b>. Was observed rolling sideways and blowing several times.  Went under Purdy bridge (between Henderson Bay and Burley Lagoon, S. Puget Sound) and was observed by another person way up into the bay. Fly fisherman had the whale blow right in front of him and startle him.

Mosquito Fleet saw 2-3 <b>gray</b> whales on north side of Hat at <b>8:15 am</b>. Stayed close to surface, slow traveling, no deep diving. Then 2 more by 8:30 am further up Saratoga Channel moving north at a good clip and diving with fluke action. Caught up with Canadian whalewatchers off Darcy Island at 12:00 pm and the <b>transients</b>. (I did not get a chance to count them). Interesting behavior to note: very huddled together like residents, but longer dive times and surfacing in sync. They traveled in the middle of channel instead of along the shore. There was one mature male who stayed in the middle of the group and several younger individuals. A couple of times the group splintered off into smaller groups that formed tight diving circles, but then the group resumed their moderate traveling pace.

Union Marina @ <b>10:00 AM</b> and she said we had missed them (HC <b>transients</b>) by about 10-20 minutes and that they appeared to be heading north up the west side of the Kitsap peninsula towards Dewatto. We had our first sighting of probably 3 of them, 1 large female and 2
younger ones heading north up the Kitsap shore of the canal. We continued
following them as they worked their way north up the shore until they were
just about opposite the Cushman Generators. We lost them just north of Dose
mouth. They had turned back south and we spotted them across from Hoodsport Marina. Continued south with them until they stopped traveling and spent about a half hour just off Dewatto. At that point we are fairly sure we counted 6
of them together, 2 large females with young. They then started traveling
south again (about <b>2:00 PM</b>) and appeared to be heading toward Bald Point

Windwalker Taibi reported 2 <b>grays</b> off East Pt. (Saratoga Psg, south of Holmes Harbor) at around <b>7:30 - 8 pm</b>. One of the whales was 200 - 300 yards offshore, mid-channel, &amp; rolled on its side with its pectoral fin &amp; part of its flukes in the air, also part of its head/mouth was above the surface of the water. It stayed in the same place for awhile, then it went under &amp; they didn't see it again. They also noticed the flukes seemed to have some shreds in it (we did have one gray whale with missing parts of its flukes reported earlier in the season), but no fresh wounds or blood was seen. They were concerned about the behavior of the whales (they do lay on their sides often while feeding in shallow water, but this one seemed to be in deeper water, lying on the surface). Interestingly, another report from earlier in the day (see below report from Mosquito Fleet) includes observations of similar behavior in one of the grays.

Saw a young (15-20 ft long) <b>gray</b> whale, alone, just off the salsbury st. park, 20 feet off shore, which is just north of the hood canal bridge. Between <b>4:30 and 6:00 p.m</b>....watched the whale swimming in very shallow water along the water's edge north and then turn and go back toward the bridge. It was clearly a baby, according to a more knowledgeable spectator. We are very worried about the young baby, fearing the momma might have been the whale sighted in Quilcene bay and there is a pod of transient Orcas in the hood canal. No other whale was anywhere...just the little baby.

<b>Gray</b> whales to report off of Langley's first street waterfront.  First sighted at about <b>8:15 PM</b> one adult and one youngster (of course, I do not know how old--but a much smaller whale) feeding right in front of my office--no more than twenty-five yards from shore. They are rolling frequently onto their sides to stir up the sand with their pectoral fins. The evidence that this has been occurring regularly was revealed with the low tide when I arrived this morning--you could see over a dozen feeding pits in the sand.  Also, as these two whales were feeding, another whale appeared, traveling in a easterly direction through the passage (from the same direction as the the other whales). This whale did not stop to feast in Langley, but cruised on by.  The adult and youngster are still out there--I can hear them--I just can't see them anymore!!

I managed to stick to the Slippery Six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) from when I picked them up opposite Twanoh State Park at approx <b>1.15pm</b> until I left them about 5.30pm at the S. end of the Skoke Delta. Eddy Green of the Skokomish tribe had been crabbing near Belfair about an hour or so earlier and the whales were near him! At Twanoh the fins surfaced! Moving at a rather slow  but steady pace westward while hugging that shoreline we watched them taking about 4/5 blows at the mirrored surface and then under for about 5 mins. When  the whales appeared to be going round Bald (Ayres) Pt at 2.15pm So. of Hoodsport Eddy joined me and we got to witness at least two probable kills... several leaping dives, tail slaps galore, lunging and milling like a football "pile-on", side breaches and "head stands" and a host of seagulls all diving and swooping down and presumably picking up food scaps. At 3.50pm they started actually traveling towards Hoodsport and to the north but close to the Kitsap Penin opposite our viewing spot. Giving one last look at the Skoke area before leaving the water on the west wide I saw the whales way in the delta and nearer Hwy 106 working on another possible kill at 5.10pm.

At <b>8:00 a.m</b>. the three HC <b>Transients</b> were in front of the Hoodsport Winery heading South. A little later I saw two more pass through.  Apparently they had spread out.

This afternoon, on the west side of Haro St. off of Henry Is., on two trips, we got to see six <b>Transient</b> Orcas kill and feed on a Steller Sea Lion. It was a primal display of raw nature. We saw the sea lion tossed into the air several times, as the Orcas wore out the animal. A mature Sea Lion is a formidable animal in a death struggle, and the strategy seemed to be to tire the animal to the point that it was defenseless, and then the kill.
We left them at <b>6:45</b> near Gooch Is. Also we got a report of <b>Orcas</b> off of south Lopez Is. about <b>4:30</b>, perhaps J Pod.

We moved on out Spieden Channel and heard a report of seven <b>Transients</b> killing a Stellar Sea Lion near Kelp Reef. We got there about a half hour after the report and the Stellar was still alive. In fact, he decided the the Squito might be the place to ask for gastromical asylum and started swimming towards us with the seven behind him. I had to back away until he got too tired to keep up.

I retraced my steps and stopped along the way to Twanoh at the property of some new orca fans and Nan and I watched from her deck - the Slippery Six kept slipping away to the east with little top-side viewing! Moving on to Twanoh State Park I was able to spend several hours watching them split into 3 a-side groups with serious chasing/ foraging activity. (Several seals were in very close to the south shore as the transients were nearer the opposite shoreline) Interestingly - this was all just around the low tide!  They did tail slaps, breaches, half breaches, "head stands," lunging and one of the juveniles kept throwing herself on her back almost level with the water... not a real "in the air"  breach! They did this several times in close to the far shore as they moved gradually west. I left them as they rounded Bald Point, opposite the Union Boat Ramp about <b>2.30pm</b>.

I saw the HCT <b>Orcas</b> heading North in front of Hoodsport at <b>12:30</b> today. They were in their normal swimming mode - no interruptions.
<br/>Harry Louch, Hoodsport
<br/>*<br/>
I was at the beach today <b>1230</b> and heard what sounded like a whale exhale. Sure enough feeding along the shoreline of Discovery Bay was one lone small <b>Gray</b>. From the top of the sand bluff it was clearly visible thru the clear water. Location: 48 03' x 122  50' the East side of the bay where it turns about half way up the shoreline. At <b>1530</b> I checked again and it was still there cruising slowly up and down the shore about 200' out.

Judy Dicksion relayed a report from Harry Louch of the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at Hoodsport at <b>12:12 pm</b>. Judy was doing a Duckabush seal count - no seals around, then she saw splashing &amp; fins down by Canal Tracts, they were making a kill, then moved south around <b>5:30 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:30 AM:</b>  Two <b>grays</b>, about one mile off shore--due south of the Scatchet Head Community Center--very active, surfacing often--too far out to get much detail.

I finally caught up with the <b>transients</b> at the south end of the  Duckabush Delta  mid-channel about <b>4.45pm</b>. They were doing lots of various in/out of water activity which appeared to be serious foraging! They went under at one point for about 10 mins and a few birds gathered. The gulls kept diving down so I think a possible kill occurred. They either were playing with another seal or purposely chasing it with another flurry of activity and gradually moved south out of my view at Canal Tracts. I returned to Canal Tracts about <b>6.30pm</b>. Though getting darker we all could see plenty of breaches, tail slaps, lunging etc. and sea birds around so possibly another kill around <b>7.10pm</b> very close to the Kitsap Penin opposite the South end of the Duckabush Delta. It was about 8.00 pm when I finally left.

Two <b>grays</b> off Gedney Island's (also known as Hat Isl.) west side at <b>9:45am</b> today. They milled across to Whidbey heading south. Left them just north of Clinton ferry dock at 10:30am.

<br/>*<br/>
At <b>11:00 AM</b> they appeared, a dozen or so black and white behemoths (<b>J pod</b>), spread out broadly at the southwest entrance to Active Pass. Soon they coalesced at Helen Point, and began their journey through Georgeson Bay, hugging the Maine Island shoreline. As they entered Active Pass proper, the Queen of Nanaimo came through (politely moving to the center of the channel to give the Orcas a wide berth), and it seemed that everyone on board moved to the
port side to catch a glimpse of the whales as they breached, rolled, and, well, just behaved like whales.

But this evening - post dusk, my bride and I are walking the queen-schnauzer on a magic slack-tide beach - full of considerable splendor - when one lone distant blow is heard - making its way towards Bells Beach.  
We watched, listened as he faded-away - then we walked towards the point.
Standing at the very tip of Fox's Spit (East Point), transformed by the deep colors of a storm-laden northwestern sky and the quiet confusion of a combined current as it softly flows towards you - then behind and beyond each ocular periphery. It's sensory-overload! But secretly - masked by the sound of the wavelets until they were right at our feet, three adults (<b>grays</b>) - fifty feet away - like great ringing bells - blow twenty feet of sulfur and rot - and like dark mountains, silently roll half their massive bodies above the surface, flip their great flukes and then rake the night time shallows - just out of sight - until, again - the ringing of the bells! We stayed for an hour until <b>9:30 pm</b> while they fed just off East Point. Then, while walking back home - we heard two more, coming-up from Baby Island to join the fun! - That's six! Wow!

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called at <b>2:10 pm</b> to report 3 <b>gray</b> whales, including "Patch" 1 mile north of Baby Island (that's about right in front of our neighborhood - of course I was in Everett!). He said they appeared to be staying in the same area. He said Tom McMillen had reported 2 grays at Possession Pt. as well.
<br/>*<br/>
We found 3 <b>gray</b> whales sleeping 1 1/2 miles off Baby Island. Patch was one of the whales. We also found a lively group of Dall's porpoise at the

I heard a couple of <b>grays</b> at <b>7a.m</b>. this morning down at the bottom of Park Ave in Langley (see report below). Just now, 10 hours later at <b>5:00</b>, I saw the pair (perhaps a return visit?) feeding near the shoreline at the bottom of my property on upper First St, Langley. One large, one smaller. The large one is the critter with the white-speckled fluke fin that is blunted at the end. We've seen a lot of it this year.

With Judy's help we found the <b>transients</b> in Hood Canal today, just after <b>1 PM</b> north of Whitney Point headed south along the west side of the channel, leaving them about 4:30 PM southbound off Duckabush. One positive and two probable kills, presumably all harbor seals.

<br/>*<br/>
With some obviously well honed motoring skills (like doing a 360 deg turn on a dime!) Robin was able to pretty well stick with the <b>Six</b> from about <b>1.00 pm to 6.00 pm</b>.  They found the <b>transients</b> on their "last chance" search... almost up to Pt. Whitney towards Quilcene Bay. Their milling around; going off in all directions and then turning to pile on with some "head stands", a few leaps and tail slaps would indicate several possible kills.

We live on Lower Hood Canal WA at Sisters Point. Althought we have had several sightings of <b>Orcas</b> in the past few weeks &amp; haven't reported them, we did see six at approximately <b>two PM</b> heading North toward Belfair, approximately 150 yards offshore.

I happened to look out our window &amp; catch a bit of <b>gray</b> whale fluke over near Camano Island at <b>4:10 this afternoon</b>. We watched for 20 minutes at least one, possibly two grays feeding &amp; traveling in Elger Bay. I first saw one traveling south, then it disappeared behind trees, but soon either the same whale or another appeared traveling north. It fed &amp; dove in Elger bay, then seemed to be traveling north toward the State Park. At 5 pm we saw another in the same area, heading north.

<b>April 4, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
The first sighting report I got was that The Six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) were traveling west from Alderbrook Resort to Union at about <b>11:00 a.m</b>. The transients had been in the Skoke delta area then moved nearer to Potlatch State Park, eventually starting traveling towards Hoodsport at around 1.09 a.m I understand. Nancy, of Beacon Point Oyster Farm had received a call from her friend that the whales had just passed Jorsted Creek going north at <b>4.45pm</b>. I settled in at Triton Tides, scope, binocs and even camcorder! Everything all set ready for their Grand Entrance!....as soon as they appeared..... which they DID almost 30 minutes later at 6.00 p.m. just southeast of the rock formation on the south side of Triton Cove...but fortunately stayed in the same area but very close to the Kitsap shoreline.

<br/>*<br/>
Ellen Dodge of Camano Island reported seeing 2 <b>gray</b> whales at <b>6 pm</b>, one in the south end of Saratoga Passage closer to the Whidbey side with lots of feeding activity, &amp; the other blowing &amp; swimming just off the Camano side.

Found the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> Orcas today at Potlatch State Park thanks to a tip from Judy. She had called to let me know that they were seen between Alderbrook and the Blue Heron Golf Course this morning between <b>10:30 - 11:00</b>. I was heading to Seattle on business so stopped at the park around 12:30. The ranger was out watching them. He pointed out where to look.  
I was surprised to see them in front of the Skokomish River delta. This is pretty shallow water. They seemed to be hunting. The river water entering the canal made it pretty murky. The ranger said that he thought that they had made a kill prior to my arrival. They didn't come in near the park as they had in at least two previous tours. Instead they headed out into the center of the canal in their slow travel mode heading North. At <b>7:00 p.m</b>. found Judy just South of the Duckabush River delta.  Although her complexion was blue she was in good spirits.  When the HCTs came around the point, Judy came back to her normal animation.

<b>2:15 pm</b> - a <b>gray</b> whale at Oak Harbor Marina....
A gray whale came into Oak Harbor Marina Monday afternoon.
When we saw the whale, it was between marina proper and Maylor Point on the east end. Saw spout three times. We watched it from D slip. Then saw spout closer out toward E. Watched there and whale was headed out of Oak Harbor. People at Marina said whale had come in actually in Marina between slips and near boats. One man estimated it at 30 feet.
We only saw its back briefly and from distance. Couldn't spot any marks. Was in close for about an hour but looked as if it would be rounding Maylor Point soon.

<br/>*<br/>
At <b>1230 pm</b> a large <b>Gray</b> was INSIDE the Oak Harbor marina. Tide was high and about 20' deep where it was feeding between F dock and E dock.  Surfaced several times in the fairway between the docks. Often was within 8' of the docks and moored boats.

At about <b>noon</b> today I was on the beach in front of the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife), near the mouth of Quilcene Bay (a part of Dabob Bay). I heard a distinctive whale-blow sound and looked up to see an adult gray beginning a terminal dive, not more than 70-100 feet off shore.  The tide was high and the whale was just beyond the limits of the public shellfish beds in maybe 30 or 40 feet of water. It surfaced shortly and lolled at the surface, breathing. It appeared to be an adult animal, head well-covered with barnacles and lots of white scarring on the part of the back that was exposed. I could clearly differentiate the head from the rest of the body as it sort of rose and sank while lolling at the surface. It dove shallowly two more times and then disappeared for about 20 minutes. It then re-appeared quite a ways off shore, heading toward the top of Quilcene Bay. I got a good peek at the underside of the fluke during the first terminal dive and it was very light colored and outlined with black. The fluke edge was also quite frilled.

Just spent an hour with our slippery friends (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>). My husband called me from Potlatch State Park at about <b>1:15pm</b> - they were in very close to shore (lots of yummy seals in the Great Bend and at Enetai). By the time I got there at 1:30, they had moved towards the middle of the Canal opposite Bald Point, but still very visible -- lots of gulls to pin them down. Lots of tail slaps(especially the young one(s); headstands,and, is there such a thing as a tailstand (or maybe it was a half-completed backflip)?  After eating, they came together and moved toward the Tahuya side, where they milled around as if trying to decide where to go next -- then another kill, I believe, because the gulls went nuts and there was lots of diving and surfacing in circles.  Play time ensued -- one happy camper did FOUR backflips in a row.

On Friday about <b>10:30</b> we observed a lone <b>gray</b> whale around Camano head. We first encountered it one mile north of Camano Head in Port Susan close to shore. The whale traveled south to the Camano Head bouy then milled about south of the bouy. Lots of tail fluke - almost every dive.

Shane, Island Adventures called with a report of the same four <b>gray</b> whales north of Greenbank quite a ways and rapidly moving south. We got with two of them just north of Langley and they were still rapidly moving south at <b>3pm</b> Friday. The other two were north of us by Baby Island and appeared to be going to stay up that way. The Gray Whales are very interesting to watch and they seem to be hanging
out together rather than solitary this year. I hope this means there is plenty of food and they are able to stay together more and forage.
