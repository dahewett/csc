<b>8:30 pm....lone Minke between Pt. Partridge and Ebey's Landing</b> slowly heading south with spectacular sunset. - Al Luneman
Pacific White-sided dolphins

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

This is about the last thing I expected us to find on our trip today...but HEY! We'll take it! <b>About 12 Pacific white-sided dolphins were lolly-gagging in between Sentinel Island and Spieden Island </b>this afternoon. Icing on the cake! - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T69's, 4 animals</b>, initially spotted at <b>Schooner Cove near Long Beach, Tofino</b> around <b>noon</b>. We encountered them aboard the Leviathan 2 with Jamie's Whaling Station close to Frank Island, Chesterman Beach. The orcas traveled from Frank Island close to shore giving all the hotels and resorts a good look, on to Duffin Cove at the entrance to Tofino harbour, round the offshore of Vargas Island and to Cleland Island where they were left at 18:00.  The animal gave a surprise breach close to their vessel, photo taken on cell phone - shows how close the activity happened! - Claire Mosley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around <b>9:20am</b> Jon received a call that<b> 50 killer whales were heading West past Neah Bay</b>. We got on the water and found them <b>passing Tatoosh Island</b>, heading Northwest. We stayed on the group for a couple hours and got photographs of many. There were about 4 or 5 smaller groups spread out over about a mile. Each smaller group was between 10-15 whales, <b>for total of 50-70 whales</b>. We thought there were at least 6 or 7 large males (some other sprouting) and about 7 calves. We are <b>guessing these are Northern Residents</b> - a couple of the males had slightly hooked dorsal fins and one looks similar to a male we saw from G pod several years ago. - Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician III, Makah Fisheries Management

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

A long one today but it was worth the ride to get my first look at<b> T65A5! The 65As</b> were coming east from <b>Race Rocks</b> as we headed down and caught up with them around Constance bank. They picked off a seal right as we got there and started the celebration.....breaches, spy hops........love that group. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Reposting this from Alex Shapiro: <b>5 Orcas passing Eagle Pt.</b> (SW San Juan Island) Heading south at <b>8:15 pm</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

The<b> T065A's</b> heading east <b>off of Otter Pt.</b> in the morning. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At Legion park Everett studying for mid term and been watching <b>a gray whale blow closer to Jetty Everett side due east of Hat Island</b>. Has been hanging there for the last hour. - Marilyn Armbruster

#49 Patch &amp; Mukilteo Ferry. #49 Patch and #723 side by side. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Lags!</b> Thanks to Western Prince for finding the Lags this afternoon! Lags? Lagenorhynchus obliquidens! Lags! <b>Pacific white-sided dolphins! West side of Speiden Channel</b>. - James Mead Maya

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

It was <b>a pod of about 33 (20 in one group, 13 in another) </b>heading North past the <b>Point Reyes Lighthouse</b>. The time was around <b>1630</b> hours.  First time seeing orca in the park! - John Eleby, US Park Ranger, Point Reyes National Seashore

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:52 - </b>We have whales! <b>Two grays between Hat Island and Everett</b>, yay!! - Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

What a fun fundraising whale cruise today with Orca Network, aboard the Mystic Sea. We even found some<b> gray whales</b> - off in the distance, AND dodged the rain showers. - Jill Hein

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 26</font></b></center>
<br/>

Pictures of the <b>orca seen at the Point Reyes Lighthouse</b> from visitors, volunteers, and rangers! An incredibly rare sighting at the lighthouse - for the three+ years I have worked here, we have had warnings that orca were headed our way but have never seen them and caught them on camera! This is the second time an orca pod has been sighted since I started working.
<br/><i>Photo believed taken by Anela Marie Ramos of <b>at least 11 orcas lined up side by side, apparently members of K pod and/or L pod</b></i>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Yup - <b>T077A and T049C - off Beechy Head, Sooke about 3:30 pm, headed west</b>. I think Eagle Wing Tours and others from vic might have been heading out to find them. - Marcie Callewaert

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I just heard over the radio <b>they are heading straight out for open water</b>. I think our time with them is numbered. Not sure where they are though. Just direction. - Liz Fincher

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Beautiful day on the water. As far as whales it was <b>5-6 Minke</b>. All being slinky. Not one did more than one breath at the surface all day. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Got to see some <b>Minkes off the Salmon Bank</b> area today. - Marcie Callewaert

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Feeling lucky here. Saw them from the <b>Vashon ferry around 4:10 p.m</b>. I almost wet myself, as I have not been following the action today and it was a big surprise! What a treat! They were beautiful... Made my day! - Shane Farnor

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:55 am - </b>A call came in from the US Coast Guard relaying a report from the Victoria Clipper IV of<b> two orcas off Eglon</b>, heading west in mid-channel. Sounds like the "twins."

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Windy the humpback</b> has returned. It has almost been exactly one year to the day that she mugged the boat I was on last season, the first time she was recorded engaging in this behaviour in this area to my knowledge. This encounter surpassed the original however ....For over an hour, <b>Windy slowly passed around and under the boat</b>. The water was flat calm, allowing us to get an amazing view of her, and to give her an amazing view of us! At one point, she came parallel to the side of the boat I was standing on, rolled on her side, and just floated there, her huge blue eye peering at us for many moments. You could even see her eye open and close, the hairs on her chin, every fine detail and scar on her skin, the extreme smell of her breath. - Tasli Shaw

Slow and steady Bigg's in the same spot (<b>Boundary Pass</b>) two days in a row. (left to right) <b>T124A1, 124A, 124A2A, 124A2</b>. Different families both days. Today it was <b>T124As and T86As</b>. Another day I am very grateful for. - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T049C and T077A </b>Transient Orcas. From the shores of <b>Edmonds to Mukilteo</b>, literally. These two Orcas nicknamed the twins (because they swim together, not related), made a kill just North of the Edmonds ferry lane then headed North to Mukilteo. I caught them just off of the beach at Marina Beach, then out from the pier, and then later on at Mukilteo Beach, again, just off of the shore. This started around <b>11-12pm in Edmonds</b> right off the shore then north of the Edmonds ferry lane, then about 2 hours later right off of Mukilteo beach. Looked like they made a kill at the 2nd stop, lots of activity and lots of birds trying to get scraps.
<br/><b>11:29 - 2 orcas close to shore off marina beach Edmonds</b> heading south (then north) moving fast. - Janine Harles

I have been waiting for *years* for a chance to check out this charismatic individual. He has remained on this elite, mythical level to me for a long time - this arguably legendary creature that others had seen, but I had only ever heard stories about. But today, after a long, tedious, nail-biting search, he surfaced and I can honestly say I erupted in goosebumps (and not just because I was being thoroughly soaked by wind-swept waves washing over the bow). It was him!...It was actually him...it was <b>CHAINSAW</b>! - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:07 - Solo big orca (T077A)</b> -- east side a mile north of<b> Edmonds terminal</b>. Close to shore heading north. More effective than four triple shot lattes to get my heart pumping!! Luckily I looked outside at the blustery weather blowing by this morning; I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this Orca's 6 foot tall fin arching out of the water heading north along the waterfront!! Made my day!! Taken today around noon - Edmonds Washington - with south Whidbey Island in the background. - Stu Davidson Photography

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T063 "Chainsaw" west bound south of Trial Island.</b> - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

On my morning trip I came across the<b> T065's</b> south bound a mile south of <b>Kelp Reef</b>. In the aftenoon I was able to re-find them <b>south of Discovery Island</b>, heading west. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>645 am - </b>Victoria Clipper III just saw <b>an orca off Duwamish Head </b>in West Seattle. - Jason Mihok

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<center><b><font color="navy">April 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

We had the <b>T065's, 86A's and 124A's in Boundary Pass</b> in the morning.  The T065's split off and headed north while the 86A's and 124A's continued south down Sidney Channel in the afternoon. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Awesome day today along the <b>Galiano shoreline</b> with <b>T87, T124 and the T90'</b>s. Almost all the other boats ended up <b>in Boundary Pass with a large group of T's</b> and we had these guys in the Strait of Georgia along Galiano. Very mellow just cruising steadily up the shoreline but so beautiful! It's amazing how you just never get tired of seeing them. Here are a few shots! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:15 PM - two orcas </b>heading south in the east channel off of<b> Pt. Piner</b> (south end of Maury Island). - Mark McDonald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:45 pm - </b>Burt Miller saw <b>two adult males</b> heading south along the ease side of <b>Vashon Island, near Gold Beach</b>. He said there were lots of gulls and an eagle over the action.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>At 8:30am</b> they were reported circling the "hamburger buoy" off<b> Salty's  (on Alki Beach, in Elliott Bay),</b> nervous harbor seals were seeking refuge on it. They've moved on apparently. - Lori Petersen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:56 AM - 2 orcas</b> just north of our house on beach drive sw (about <b>a mile south of Alki Pt</b>. on Alki Beach. 100 yards off shore: two orcas, lat: 47:33:58.59 long: 122:24:32.33, swimming 100 yards out, then coming in close to shore (10 yards). slowly heading north. - Dennis Batchelder

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:50am - 2 Orcas off Beach Drive SW in West Seattle</b>. About 25 yards from shore. Have not seen them this close to our shore in the past. Chasing after something. Harbor Seals popped up their heads once the Orcas where gone. - Melinda Simon

<br/><br/>

Sighted <b>a single orca in Elliott Bay</b> (roughly off Smith Cove). Sighted from the Bainbridge ferry (<b>9:40 AM departure</b>) enroute to Seattle. New WSF 144 car ferry was also undergoing sea trials in vicinity (the M/V Tokitae). - Bruce Hutchison

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were able to catch up with <b>a humpback traveling north along the shoreline of Saturna Island in Boundary Pass</b>. Thanks to the crew of the Island Roamer who spotted it while hiking up Monarch Head and reporting it to us.  It was the same animal as the one seen the day before  off of Victoria. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

First <b>Humpback Whale</b> of the season! The Western Prince II is viewing a Humpback Whale up in the <b>Canadian Gulf Islands</b> right now. Thanks to Mark Malleson for finding it!

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spotted<b> two Orcas on Fauntleroy/Southworth ferry about 4:35</b>. On north side of ferry about 1/2 way between West Seattle and Blake Island. - Andrew Medina

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:15 - </b>They are now heading south.
<b>12:03 - Two orcas just off West Point</b>. Frolicking/feeding with no direction of travel. Appeared to have made a kill of something - saw a splash of red. Very cool! - Jim Devereaux

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:35 - </b>We saw them from our office window in <b>downtown Seattle</b> - The Nature Conservancy in Washington. - Robin Stanton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Single <b>orca spotted at 10:05</b> between east bound<b> Bainbridge ferry and magnolia</b>. Lots of spouting and great view of fin and upper markings. - Leslie Jones Hansen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:41 -</b> Still <b>under the bridge</b> - just saw it [<b>gray whale</b>] come up again again for the 3rd time.
<br/><b>9:32 - </b>Just spotted a whale <b>under the narrows bridge (in Tacoma)</b> heading north. Not orca - didn't see find. Saw spouting. Definitely not porpoises - much bigger. Best I can tell is it's skin is bumpy &amp; not black. Did not see any fins and looked bigger than orca although admittedly I haven't seen any this close. Direction of travel is not definite - I initially saw it a little south of the<b> [Narrows] bridge</b>, then 2 times under the bridge then just a bit south again. It was more on the <b>gig harbor side of the the bridge</b>. Waiting for it to come up again but haven't seen anything for a bit now. - Heidi Powers Armstrong

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:41 - Twins in Elliott bay</b> right now. Viewable from bainbridge ferry. - Wendy Horger Alsup

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:31 - </b>I see him from lower<b> Queen Anne</b>. Seems to be heading east getting close to the Seattle waterfront. - Katie Kirking

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

What a day! Searching all over the Gulf Islands with not a whale to be seen and then, on the way home, we found the <b>T100's, 137's and 36A's in the Strait of Georgia</b>. They were hanging out right in the middle of the gulf moving west at 7 knots. My first Bigg's encounter of the year.....it's always so amazing to see them but especially in such a large group. They seemed to be mostly in travel mode but the two sprouters (<b>T137A and T100C)</b> broke off from the rest of the group and spent some time interacting, here is a shot of the two of them. It's incredible to see the the difference in T100C's fin from the first time I saw him in 2007 until now. His fin is starting to get quite large and looks like it's taking on a "T19B" shape. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

I spotted <b>three Orca in Port Townsend bay</b>, due east of the ferry dock, ~500 ft SE of Taylor and Water St. in downtown Port Townsend. There were two adults and one young. One of the adults appeared to be hunting an otter or seal, the other adult was flanking the prey, while the little one was trying to keep up. One of the adults seemed clearly to be hunting what I think was a river otter. The otter swam under the back of a cruise ship, and then dock, I think. I didn't see where the Orcas went after that. - Rico Moore

Whales swimming in a circular fashion, popping up for breath and immediately submerging again. 3 minimum. 2 males and 1 female (dorsal fins) Near the Seattle to Bainbridge ferry crossing in the middle of the route (~60-100 ft from ferry). Looked like feeding. The first 2 I saw were headed south (both male). Then 2 more popped up (one female one male) headed north and they continued in this manner with 1 or 2 popping up at a time and swimming circularly. There were also sea gulls at the surface of the water where the orcas were surfacing. - Shawnte Greenway

Magical day on "Mystic Sea" with <b>gray whales</b> and the unexpected bonus of <b>five transient orca at 11:30 am</b> including Big Daddy (not official designation!) and a calf. Big Daddy with his ruffled dorsal fin (so like our much loved resident orca Ruffles) paired up with another male heading towards Hat Island while passing a gray whale closer inshore and stopping the<b> Clinton/Mukilteo ferry </b>to give thrilled passengers a rare treat. All five whales grouped up and circled for a kill, although there was no evidence on the surface other than wheeling gulls. Another perfect day in the wonderful Pacific Northwest.

The weather and light last night were picture perfect with the Olympic foothills distinctly outlined in front of the snow covered peaks farther back.

Unexpectedly, I spotted a blow on the horizon, then another and then a breach followed by at least 35 similar splashes as we sailed towards Seattle. They were clearly visible all the way across Elliott Bay. There might have been porpoise among them. The splashes were so big and frequent that we were able to watch/see them for about 15 or 20 minutes from the ferry - their blows remained clearly visible almost all the way to Seattle due to favorable lighting and atmospheric conditions. It was a special treat; a good omen. - Gerard Wirz

<b>8:07 -</b> boy are they moving fast! Passing by<b> Shilshole marina </b>now looking from the south end of rolling bay on Bainbridge. Mid channel.
<br/><b>7:58 -</b> Looking from <b>rolling bay on Bainbridge</b> they are about to cross in front of Golden Gardens.
<br/><b>7:55 -</b> Finally spotted them! They're going to pass to the Bainbridge side of the second tanker in a minute. - Lynn Batson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:38 - </b>Yes! Between G<b>olden Gardens and Pt. Monroe</b>, mid-channel.
<br/><b>7:37 - </b>Between <b>Meadow Point and Halvorsen's Buoy</b>. Southbound at a good clip.

<b>7 pm - Pod of 8 orcas. </b>About a mile or less off <b>Richmond Beach heading west towards Bainbridge</b>. Perhaps they were feeding or playing, they would go down and then all appear on the surface. They would come up high above the surface and seemed to be playing. - Debra Brown

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:22 - </b>Still in the same spot....for <b>over an hour south of the Kingston ferry lane mid channel</b>. - Jamie Grundhauser

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6 pm - </b>Jamie Grundhauser is watching the Transients/Bigg's Whales in mid-channel, <b>between Richmond Beach, Edmonds and Carkeek Park</b>. They have been in a resting line, basically lined up side-by-side, moving slowly southward, for about ten minutes.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:50 -</b> it looks like they've got their engines started again... moving together as a group in a SW to WSW direction, headed out towards mid-channel, pointing roughly towards <b>Fay Bainbridge</b>.
<br/><b>6:30pm -</b> they're *still* more or less parked in the same area, SW of my place in <b>Richmond Beach</b>. No sign that the whales have decided to move on. Birds are still working the area too, so there must be good bits leftover...
<br/><b>6:10pm - </b>they're still parked in roughly the same area as they were when they were working over that harbor seal around 5pm. <b>3-4 of them are in a resting line</b> facing S to SE, a couple are facing roughly NW to N a little further to the north of the S-facing resters, which is also where the birds seem to be focusing their attention.
<br/><b>5:00pm -</b> looks like it's a harbor seal they're trying to have for dinner. At least one of the whales is being very surface active... might be a prey item it's wrestling with...
<br/><b>4:51 -</b> Was able to get <b>a good count of 7 of them</b>. Transient dorsals for sure. Sounds like the same ones Brad was with earlier.
<br/><b>4:44 - </b>Seeing dorsal fins from Richmond Beach now. If you're at Kayu Kayu Ac park, that'd be a great view. They'll be visible from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in about 5-10 minutes (around 4:50-4:55) then heading towards Carkeek shortly after that. Sticking closer to the King County side. Sorry Kitsap folks! - Dave Haas

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:28 - </b>I see them heading south into Puget sound. <b>Passing edmonds</b>. Going FAST. They are being very stealthy. I would head to Carkeek. - Sara Troyer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:35 -</b> NOAA researchers left the whales just north of the Edmonds ferry lane, with no clear direction but trending westward. He ID'd <b>T137 and T137A</b> among a probable <b>total of 7</b>. They might continue around the south end of Whidbey and head NW, or they might go south into Puget Sound. Or for that matter they could turn around and head NE.

Kristine Marshall called at <b>1:45 pm </b>from the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton ferry</b>, reporting <b>3 orcas just south of the ferry</b> including 1 adult male, closer to the Clinton side. She had also seen at least<b> 1 Gray whale </b>between Langley and Hat/Gedney Island earlier in the ferry crossing (the Grays are likely quite relieved the Transient orcas continued south!).

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called at <b>1:40 pm</b>, they are with a tight <b>group of Transients</b> just south of the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton</b> ferry run, closer to the east/ Mukilteo side, with the whales continuing south.

About <b>8 am - On the Lopez-Friday Harbor</b> ferry this morning, when the boat cuts its engines in the middle of the strait, it's usually a good sign - and it was. <b>A couple of killer whales </b>came by, close to the boat to say hey, then carried on. It was a little ways out from<b> Brown Island </b>- they were heading east as the ferry headed to the harbour...just a couple, possibly a male &amp; female (by dorsal size)...shot with my little pocket camera, as you can tell...the orca shown is heading to the left, in the pic (so she might be a T). Always nice to see friends...- Ian Byington

Had an encounter with twins today. <b>T49C and T77A</b> were found traveling together <b>in the Gulf Islands</b>. I have seen T49C before but not T77A. They are amazingly almost identical looking. Both have twin notches in just about the same place! We also found a huge chunk of lungs in San Juan Channel on the way out. I imagine from a Steller Sea Lion, but who knows. The lungs were about 20 miles away from the whales, so not sure if it was left over from these guys or another group of Transients. Notice the fresh rake marks on T49C. - Ivan Reiff

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were able to catch up with<b> T077A and T049C</b> in the morning  west o<b>f Mandarte Island (Haro Strait)</b>.  Thanks to Jeff on Goldwing for finding them. They killed a seal as soon as we arrived and we spent our entire time watching them sharing it with each other while the gulls picked up the scraps. In the <b>late afternoon</b> I saw them take another seal <b>in Navy Channel</b>. They then skulked along  the shoreline of Mayne Island, enter the western entrance of Active Pass and then turn and head west up Trincomali Channel.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:48pm</b>: We are enjoying <b>a pod northbound right now moving FAST from Possession Point to Clinton</b>. We took some first-timer friends in search of Grays and came up empty for 90 minutes. Imagine our surprise returning to Edmonds to have such a great encounter. Maybe our friends are good luck? The Orcas were on a mission-- <b>8.5 MPH over ground into a 2.5 MPH outgoing tide</b>. Fun stuff! I can email more photos for I.D. - Jim Fahey
<b>Dave Ellifrit:  The big bull is T11A. I was just talking yesterday about wanting to see him again so send him up here! The sprouter is a little too grainy to say anything with any certainty but it MAY be T137A if his upper nick is being invisible in the grain.</b>

We had a great day out on the water with a group of transients today. We got a call at <b>9:30AM</b> from local whale watcher Paul Pudwell with Sooke Coastal Explorations. He was with<b> a large group of transients</b> feeding at <b>Race Rocks Pacific Ecological Reserve</b>. By the time we left our station at Pedder Bay they were headed east in Constance Bank, split into two groups. We were able to identify them as the<b> T101s</b>, the same whales spotted in Puget Sound near Seattle Washington a few days earlier. They were spread out foraging and doing 4-10 min dives. We followed them towards Trail Island light house. - Josh McInnes

A glorious day for whale watching on "Mystic Sea." Making our way towards a heart-shaped blow silhouetted by the sunshine, we met up with<b> No. 56</b> as we headed towards Everett. Soon <b>No. 49 (Patch) and No. 53 (Little Patch) </b>swam into view, delighting passengers with the unforgettable smell of whale breath drifting on the light breeze. So good to be on the water with our visiting whales on such a calm sunny afternoon. - Sandra Pollard

I was coming back from Fort Worden State Park Port Townsend, after a day of watching <b>2 gray whales</b>/ possibly a calf swimming in the area.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

From Rob Taylor: I vote white sides too. I crossed the hood canal bridge at <b>4:30 (April 6) and there were 30-40 scattered on each side of the bridge</b>, surfacing every twenty yards or so. It was amazing, but what I saw weren't orcas.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I was awakened this morning with a steaming cup o' joe and four words every PNW woman wants to hear, "The whales are here." Jumped (a relative verb at my age) out of bed, grabbed my camera, and shot the ballet happening before our eyes. <b>Gray whale feeding on ghost shrimp in the Saratoga Passage off Langley</b>, slow and methodical which for a mammal this size only makes sense. We thought it was two whales because of the span, but quickly realized it was one *huge* whale. They spin slowly, hypnotically, using their fins to stir up the ghost shrimp embedded in the sand below, and then feast. Also saw my first fluke on the Mystic Sea cruise last Friday night to benefit our new Langley Whale Center. I guess you could say it has been one whale of a week on Whidbey Island. Looking forward to the Welcome the Whales parade on the 19th. These magnificent creatures deserve a formal 'Welcome." - Debra Campbell

I didn't see the whale, but Tradewinds Charters in <b>Depoe Bay Oregon</b> did. They had the whale on their Whale Watch Report on April 4th. You might have already seen this, but I thought I'd send it anyway. Here's the report: Date: Friday, April 4, 2014 at 07:11 Current Report: Sometimes you get lucky on Gray whale cruises and see the Orca's at the same time. They are spectacular and thanks to one of our passengers who shared some of the pictures he took on the cruise.  <b>Male orca with a notch in the trailing edge of dorsal fin</b>. - Julie Massa

<b>4:30 - Saw orcas traveling south through the Narrows</b>. Were first sighted on the West side of the Narrows, South of Gig Harbor, close to the beach under the bluffs. They moved out into the center of the channel North of the Narrows Bridge, and crossed under the center of the main span of the Narrows Bridge. Last seen heading South, still in the main channel about 1 to 2 miles South of the bridge. One orca with a very tall dark dorsal fin and two smaller ones with short dorsal fins, lighter in color. Traveling South through the Narrows, South Sound. Although, as they moved out into the center of the channel North of the Narrows Bridge, they went underwater for a minute or two. The one with the very tall dorsal fin came to the surface about 100 to 200 feet further to the East, but rejoined the others in the middle of the channel before going under the bridge. -  Warren Wilson
