<b>5:00 p.m. - </b>Just saw them from <b>Alki trending south...3 for sure</b>, but only saw them come up twice. Too far out to identify or get pictures. -Jill Hadji

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Fred Felleman called to relay a report to him of <b>4 orcas, including one adult male, southbound at West Point/Discovery Park (Seattle) at approx. 4:30</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 - 4:10 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound - </b>watched what is turning out to be a <b>4th whale (to Stu's 3)</b> After last report <b>humpback</b> flipped and is now traveling south, shallow surfaces approx. every minute in southerly direction. Same general area as earlier post.
<br/><b>3:50 and 3:55 - from Stamm Overlook Park</b>, north Edmonds saw blows of at least one whale<b> 1.5- 2 miles south of Possession Point.</b> Northerly travel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:01 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound  - group of three humpbacks now on north end of Sandy Lane - Kitsap side</b> .
<br/><b>3:35 p.m. - </b> repeated tail slaps by one of the three!
<br/><b>3:08 p.m.  - humpbacks are back and forth'ing on the Kitsap side near Rose point and Elgon</b>.  As seen due west from north Edmonds. *when I first saw these I thought it was an orca pod due to number of blows! But then I saw their back and knew it was humpbacks. I think it might be three - maybe a mom and calf + 1 - they are staying close together. Last dive was southerly most close to what I believe is near Rose point
<br/><b>2:42 p.m. -  two, maybe three humpbacks about 1.5 miles south of Point No Point </b>heading northerly near shipping lanes Kitsap side. Whales relatively close together making seeing the blows easier.. Especially given this gusty day! -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:20 p.m. - central Puget Sound  - </b>Charlie reports <b>a humpback whale off the North end of Vashon Island</b>, between Vashon and Blake Islands.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">October 30</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Humpback in Puget Sound. Off Point No Point</b>, Hansville, WA. -Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:30 p.m. - central Puget Sound  </b>- I saw a single humpback just <b>south of Southworh ferry</b>... Very near shore heading northbound. Went to Harper pier hoping to see it near Blake Island, but never saw it again. Lots of wind waves made for difficult viewing. -Noreen Ferris

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:07 p.m. - north Puget Sound -  Humpback in Saratoga Passage</b>, mid channel, in front of Woodland Beach, Camano Island. Appeared to be heading south. Saw 4 blows, saw back and tail when he dove. Additional blows suggest several whales. -Krista Paulino

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:27 a.m. - north Puget Sound  - humpback whale</b> appears to be sleeping at the surface. I can see its back but not doing anything but floating in one spot. <b>East of Point No Point</b> and east of shipping lanes. As seen from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">October 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>11:54 a.m. -</b> I have a friend, Elysia, who now lives on the water in<b> Port Townsend</b> (lucky girl!). This is who they saw off their porch. Here are the co-ordinates they posted: so this was <b>NW of Pt. Hudson</b>, NW of Chetz, NW of red bell #2, between Pt Hudson and Pt. Wilson. They're excited to know the identities if anyone has any idea. I know it's a long shot. -Traci Wilson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas NW of Pt. Hudson,</b> NW of Chetz, NW of red bell #2, between Pt Hudson and Pt. Wilson. -Elysia Hartzell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:50 a.m.  - </b>Saw about five , including one adult male and one female/juvenile, <b>heading north from Port Townsend toward Point Wilson</b>, at Point Hudson (the marina)....headed out of Admiralty. -Jen Matchem

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We received a message from <b>10:13 this morning</b> from a woman reporting <b>a pod of orcas </b>off the <b>south end of "the island"</b> about 1/2 mile west of the south end ferry dock. Did not say which island but we are guessing Whidbey, and Clinton ferry dock? She said she has never seen this many before - but did not say how many or what direction they were traveling. We have left a message asking for more information, will post when we receive it - but perhaps someone should be looking in Possession Sound as well?

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:59 a.m. - 4+Orcas </b>with blows and tails heading north towards <b>Double Bluff just outside Useless Bay</b>! I'm at home I Useless Bay Shores and too far away for pictures. -Ellen Molbak Welsch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:00 p.m.- north Puget Sound  - </b>Marilyn Deroy is watching<b> two humpbacks east of Point No Point</b>, quite a ways out but with two blows almost simultaneously it must be two whales.

I was out walking at Point No Point today from 3:55pm until after 5:00pm and saw two large adult Humpbacks feeding together. They were blowing and diving fairly shallow which gave me the opportunity to see most of their bodies. Wow! What a show! They were moving south of the lighthouse, across in front of the lighthouse and over to Norwegian Point and back again. A few times they were quite close to the beach because the tide was in. Amazingly, beautiful animals! -Jann Clare

SUCCESS! <b>Bigg's killer whale in Case Inlet.</b> After four hours, I was on my way home and just happened to look right as I made the final stretch into <b>Pierce County along Case Inlet</b> and boom! I caught a dorsal out of the corner of my eye. I did a u-turn and parked on the side of the road, then ran up to a guy with a waterfront house and asked if I could use his yard to take pictures. He was very cool about it, and even went to look at them from his deck. I was treated to a twilight show by a male, female, and a baby.

<br/>Multiple pod calls audbile. Last night Barbara and David heard and identified <b>southern resident orcas in Johnstone Strait</b>. They had been seen earlier in the afternoon near Ripple Point making their way north. Then this afternoon Jared called to say the southern residents were off Donegal Head. Very soon after we heard calls! But the calls were northern G clan calls, specifically I31/I11 type calls!!! What the??? We told Jared. He said "seriously?" because he was looking at southern residents clustered together behind a tug heading into Blackfish Sound. We could hear the southerns but the G clan calls sounded closer. Jared then reported that there was a group close to Flower Island. Was this the G clan group? They then came into view. Jared followed this group in and identified them as <b>a mix of I31s and I11s. (northern G clan orcas)</b> As he followed this group he watch the southern residents move close to Burnt Point on the Hanson Island side and soon they were in our view. There were a lot of southern residents!!!! The northerns chose to stay on the far shore almost parallel to the southerns who moved to mid channel. The vocals dropped off. The groups progressed through the Pass and out of view. Whew! So beautiful! So unusual, once in a lifetime! But it was not all yet over. We had seen another group over on the far shore and eventually this group made their way into Blackney well after the others. It turned out to be the<b> A34s with A46!</b>. There was just enough light to see them and Jared came back to do a quick confirmation before heading home. Southern and northern residents are not known to mix and this was a close. So amazing, we are all blown away and thankful too. -Helena &amp; Paul

This evening I was paddle boarding near <b>Blake Island</b> when an <b>Orca</b> came fishing nearby. The whale stayed in the harbor for nearly an hour. It was magical. I also heard that there was a grey whale in the same area this morning. She was alone. She was large. When she breathed it sounded like a freight train. She was diving, swimming back and forth, and slapping her tail. At first she was in the ferry lane then eventually swam toward Manchester/Bainbridge. A guy on a sail boat said the whale was chasing Coho Salmon in the ferry lane. He saw her too.  When the whale returned 30~40 minutes later a fisherman was witnessing her as well. A woman and her son on shore in South worth could see her too. She was Definitely larger than a porpoise or dolphin...it was a magnificent whale. I am so happy and honored to have seen her. -Gina O'Brien

This is the<b> fin whale</b> that's been hanging around <b>south of Lopez Island for the past few weeks</b>. I finally saw it today. Fin whales are the 2nd largest animal on earth behind the blue whale. This is the first time a fin has been seen in this area for at least 10 yrs. I've heard contradicting things about it and have been wanting to get a look. Fins are seen routinely in Southern Ca. and I've seen many. They are also an animal we had to know to complete naturalist training in Ca. Although they can reach 75-80 feet in length I would estimate this animal at 50-55 feet. Either a sub-adult or just a smallish adult. It appears to be healthy and was behaving normally, maintaining a rhythmic sequence of 8 minute long dives with 3 breaths on the surface in between. Based on the bowel movement it had while we watched it seems to be feeding just fine. The whale has penella balaenopterae pits but so far I have not seen any penella remaining attached. They are a warm water parasitic copepod and would likely detach in the cold water here. Good to see this whale. I hope it hangs around for awhile. The common murres on the other side of the whale are about 1 foot long and give some size perspective. -James Grehsam

Got word of some apparent<b> humpbacks seen between the Edmonds and Point No Point this AM</b> by birders. "I saw quite a few blows and several backs of what looked like Humpbacks in a 30 second period about 8:30am this morning from the pier. The quick frequency of the blows made me think I was seeing at least two whales. They were far enough that I could only see the very top of their backs and their blows though so hard to know." The direction they said would put them between PNP and Whidbey. -Josh Adams
