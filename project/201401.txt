<h3><center>January 2014 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">January 31</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:00 - Two gray whales</b> out front of my house. Heading north. Currently TWO gray whales <b>heading north out of Eld Inlet (Olympia)</b> toward Hunter Point and Squaxin Island and Hope Island. - Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:20 pm - off Fox Spit </b>on <b>south Whidbey Island across from Camano Island state park</b>: one large male and a few smaller females (?) spotted! Very cool! - Ann Brockenbrough

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3 pm - </b>After cruising a lap around Holmes Harbor, we headed north and east around Baby Island and then south toward Fox Spit. Just <b>before passing Fox Spit we saw a lone Orca </b>emerge with an erect dorsal fin that seemed to have a broken tip. He was very large and he didn't come up enough to see any white on him. We slow to watch but keep our heading. Shortly after, once we passed Fox Spit, two more orcas emerged. These two were more lively, coming higher out of the water and blowing water over and over. <b>These orcas were swimming together about 1/4 mile behind the first, but in the same exact direction toward Baby Island</b>. They appeared to be traveling and unfazed in direction by our presence. They moved leisurely, but at a pace where they were out of site within 7 minutes or so. We didn't follow as we didn't want to scare them. - Travis Coursey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:12 - </b>Killer whale - two maybe in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>. Just south of Keystone heading south. - Mary Hulbert

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">January 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

These<b> orcas were spotted in the Gastineau channel of Juneau, AK</b> yesterday. They are resident orcas, correct? - Jennifer Quinto

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:13 pm -</b> Sighted the pod of<b> three orcas off President Point Road, Kingston</b>, yesterday afternoon. - Becky Yee Perry

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:19 - </b>they're way over <b>on the Kitsap side</b> and the light is failing. I've pretty much lost them <b>from Richmond Beach</b> in the low light.  
<br/><b>5:16 -  </b>All three back together, moved south at a faster pace, now approaching the pier at <b>Jefferson Beach Park</b>. Some thrashing water, with the big male pushing / chasing something (seal? sea lion?) up out of the water with his rostrum. This is in the same area I watched a transient male do this same sort of thing a month or two ago... 
<br/><b>5:13 - </b>The big male disappeared, while the other two continued heading south. And now all three have gone stealth mode. *poof!* I'm <b>guessing these are transients</b>. Looks like they're working an area of water over and over again... perhaps chasing some prey. 
<br/><b>4:47 - </b>I have them just west of mid-channel buoy, heading south,<b> between Kingston and President's Point</b>. One big male, one smaller female/kiddo, and possible sprouting male. They're well over towards the Kitsap side. Maybe ½ mile out. Some short-term directional changes, but all three appear to be heading south again now. - Dave Haas 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:20 -  3 orcas -</b> large one, medium size, and little. <b>Ferry from Edmonds</b> had to swing wide. Closer to Kingston moving southwest. Couple, three miles from ferry dock. Erin Kallal Johnson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:10 -  Three spotted off the Edmonds-Kingston ferry</b> heading south. One seems little - Robbin Rae

<br/>
<b>4:30 pm - </b>Carrie Newell called the Center for Whale Research to report seeing <b>a large number of Southern Resident orcas heading north off Depoe Bay, Oregon</b>. She took photos and will send those to the Center soon. These <b>may be members of K and L pods</b>, because J pod with L87 was recently off eastern Juan de Fuca Strait.   

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The transmitter worn by <b>L87 Onyx between January 22 and January 26 apparently fell off about 30 miles west of Neah Bay</b>.

<br/><br/>

<br/>

Saw <b>gray whales today at 15:00 west entrance to Deception Pass</b>. Appeared to be two adults and one yearling. Whales were swimming against the current, the latter flowing west out of Deception Pass. Watched the whales in this area for about 45 minutes at the west entrance to Deception Pass o.4 miles west of bridge north side of channel, appeared to be feeding or slowly traveling. - Kent Dought

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Maribeth Crandall reports seeing a large whale, <b>possibly a Gray whale, swimming east through Deception Pass at 3:50 pm today</b>. 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">January 24</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>T123's were feeding off Sooke</b> (about ten miles west of Victoria). Rush and I came across the T123's feeding off of Sooke in the afternoon. Just before spotting them we saw a group of harbor porpoise moving quickly west and a series of large slicks left in the water. The whales carried chunks of flesh around during our 25 minutes of observation. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/>
<b>9:09 am - </b>We have <b>orcas in the Sinclair Inlet</b> (an arm of Puget Sound in Kitsap County near Bremerton) again -- 2 <b>between Manette and Manchester</b>, heading north/northeast. It was hard to see them this time because they were on the other side of the inlet, but I think this is the same pair I've seen before. It looks to me like a female and a baby. One dorsal is larger, both are curved on the back. When they're on this side of the inlet, they do a lot of diving because of the reef over here, there are a lot of big fish and sea lions, etc., on this side, and they all go there for the smaller fish around the reef. This time, they were just beneath the surface -- I think they may have been sleeping, because they weren't moving much. Usually after they stop by the reef, they move pretty quickly out of the inlet, toward the rest of the Sound; they don't hang around long. Today they stayed near the Manette side in the still water out of the shipping lane for at least half an hour in the same spot. Didn't get another chance to check before it got dark. - L Michelle Gardner

<b>2:50 PM - 30 to 35 False Killer Whale pod</b> traveling west - watched a large pod, 30-35 individuals, of False Killer Whales slowly pass<b> Norwegian Point in Hansville</b> heading west at approximately 2:50pm. The whales were just traveling in a line and not feeding. Their lack of speed and location close to the south side of the strait made for a great sighting. Plenty of time to watch them and try to get an approximate count. They were traveling west in an approximate line with no apparent feeding nor any beaching. I waited a day to report the sighting because I was skeptical that the pod I saw could be False Killer Whales and finally decided that I should report what I had seen.  I am a photographer and almost never am without a camera, but, when I went on a quick trip to the Post Office on the fifteenth I didn't grab one of them.  I regretted it once I stopped at Norwegian Point just to see if anything was happening on the strait.  So, no images are available.  The whales were very close to shore, maybe four or five hundred feet out and I did have my binoculars.  Given their size in relation to the loons out near them I estimated the larger individuals to be somewhere in the range of fifteen feet in length.  My wife and I kayak and have been very close to Dall Porpoises, Grey Whales, Orcas, Humpback Whales and Common or Pacific Dolphins here in the Washington, around Vancouver Island and in Alaska.  These whales were none of those species.  They were black all over and had dorsal fins that were angled back with a rounded tip.  The fins were not nearly as tall as those on an Orca nor as pointed as those on a Dall Porpoise.  I never did see the snout area since they were not energetically surfacing while they traveled.  They were purposefully and slowly heading west and the entire group would surface twice before going under for a short period of time and then resurface twice again.  I saw this sequence about five times and the individuals didn't appear to change location within the group much.  They were not in a clump, rather more linear with never more than three or so next to each other, thus my rough count. 
Again, I am skeptical of my identification, but, given the size, shape and color of the whales thought I had better report the sighting.  It would be nice if someone else would see and report them. - David Keathley

New Year's Day - what a start to the New Year! <b>J and K pods in Admiralty Inlet</b> ALL day, mostly well spread out, grouping up occasionally.
