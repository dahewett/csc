<h3><center>October 2012 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>October 31, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
At about<b> 11:45</b> this morning I was on the <b>south end of Lopez, near Iceberg Point</b>, watching a tanker moving through the choppy straits. Some of the splashing between me and the tanker was larger than the surrounding whitecaps and that splashing seemed to be moving east to west. After a few minutes of watching through the binoculars I was able to spot a <b>minke whale </b>breach completely clear of the water, heading west.
<br/>Tom Reeve, Lopez Island

<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>*<br/>
From the Queen of Burnaby ferry at about<b> 3:35 pm</b> between <b>Little River and Texada Island several hundred Pacific white sided dolphins</b> seen in two groups some moving South and others moving North. Hard to judge numbers but the larger southbound group covered an area about 300 metres by fifty. Beautiful sight.

<b>5 pm - </b>Just found <b>J &amp; K Pod along with L87 </b>- all grouped up resting at <b>Constance Bank</b>. All in a tight resting line - Eastbound first, then westbound. Left them at <b>1730 hrs.</b> right on top of <b>Constance Bank at sunset</b>, all grouped up MILLING..... No direction.
<br/>Jeff Lamarche

<b>October 28, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
From the West Seattle Blog: We followed them <b>from roughly Alki all the way up to Mukilteo</b>. We had all the members of<b> J Pod, K Pod and a few L-Pod whales </b>as well. Didn't see any foraging, but just lots of slow travel and socializing. Collected several fecal samples in addition to all the photo identification work. 
<br/>Jeff Hogan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:30 -</b> Pam, Cindy, Ed and I leave in darkness, could just see <b>Js &amp; Ks gliding northward </b>100 yards out from <b>Edmonds dive Park</b> buoys. So close to this side they very well could be heading up Possession Sound towards Mukilteo. Saw breaches, tail lobbing just before nightfall. Amazing journey with orca and other wildlife today.
<br/><b>6:00 -</b> in the rain and waning daylight they are east of mid channel out from <b>South Edmonds /Kingston.</b> Foraging, tail lobbing and in general steady movement north
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks

<b>5:51pm - </b>And now on to <b>Edmonds-Kingston ferry lane</b>.
<br/><b>5:43 - </b>Many more suddenly closer in towards <b>Richmond Beach</b>. Probably 6-9 total. Some synchronized porpoising by 2, with non-sync'd porpoising by others close in. Looks like they're maybe on to something tasty!
<br/><b>5:38 -</b> Another group of 3 closer in towards <b>Richmond Beach</b>. Rest of group spread all around mid channel buoy to N and S. Overall s<b>till heading N</b>, possibly picking up speed.
<br/><b>5:32 - </b>Ok, looks like clusters of three groups, totaling <b>10-15 killer whales</b>. Lots of surface active behaviors, especially in the front and middle groups.
<br/><b>5:16 - </b>Beginning to see activity <b>SW of Richmond Beach</b> now! Just saw a splash!
<br/>Dave Haas
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:39 - </b><b>Richmond Beach ORCAS</b> &amp; you don't need binoculars!

<br/>Connie Bickerton
<br/>*<br/>
We were sailing along off <b>Shilshole </b>paralleling their course about 150 200 yards then they disappeared for about 3 or 4 minutes then out of no where they were behind us. What and exciting day.
<br/>Sean Kaier
<br/>*<br/>

To the delight of everyone on board, we saw <b>orcas </b>on both the outbound and return ferry trips between <b>Seattle/Bainbridge</b>, about 200 yards off. Outbound at <b>10:35 ferry</b>: saw 4 or 5.... Return trip <b>at 2:05, saw 6-8</b>. They were playing, swimming, not sure about feeding. One breached up and out of water, then flopped on its side. Made everyone on board shriek with delight! On the return trip around 2:15 p.m. I saw one male. Have seen whales in this area before once a year or so ago.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>5ish -</b> I just got home from the <b>Mukilteo </b>area, got to the Lighthouse as just the tail end of the group was passing, probably about 5ish? Not positive about the time.. One large male closest to the Mukilteo side, probably 150 yds out from the lighthouse. Others spread out across the channel, a couple over towards the Clinton side, and one or two drifted more towards Hat Island area. Left there and ran up to Harborview Park, where we could see them out <b>between the Clinton and Hat Island area</b>, looking like they were coming back together more, and headed up the Saratoga direction last I could see of them.
<br/>Pam Ren

<b>October 25, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Heard Orcas at approx. <b>2115 </b>hrs both traveling and playing or feeding going south to north off <b>Mouat Point on Pender Island</b> (48 deg 46.6 x 123 deg 19.1). No idea about numbers or duration, as I had just stepped outside after walking the dog, but I could hear more than a few traveling both north and south of our location. I continued to listen until <b>2130</b>. I believe I heard an older and younger Orca playing or feeding at this location for that 15 minute period time before moving north.
<br/>Kathy Gilbert
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:32 - Orcas </b>just past <b>Alki point</b> in the dark. You could barely see them, but you could really hear them blow, tail lobbing too.
<br/>Bill Rogers
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales calls in an update at <b>6:05 pm</b>: he is watching the pod of<b> 12 + orcas</b>, grouped up now, and in the <b>Bainbridge/Seattle ferry lanes</b> - good news for commuters!
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:00 - </b>We leave as they continue south out of view,<b> two groups</b> both with one large male gliding along in flat waters hugging <b>Magnolia</b>. Another <b>group of 3-5 </b>are closer to mid channel and the tail enders just passed West Point five minutes ago all at a slow, resting pace.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
I rushed out of the house to see them from Fay Bainbridge Park and caught them out towards<b> Discovery Park</b>. The orca endorphins cured my headache, so double thanks!
<br/>Kate Schmiett
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:45 - </b>Ed and I are at <b>Sunset park above Shilshole</b>...lead group passed by West Point/Discovery Park, very close to this side. pace has slowed, seas are super calm. other group more mid channel nearing WP/DP.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:42 -</b> Just saw one heading south. Looked to be off the<b> discovery park</b> light house.
<br/>Connie Bickerton
<br/>*<br/>
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries reports they were with<b> parts of L pod </b>today, leaving them around <b>5:30 pm</b> as the whales continued south past <b>West Pt.</b> Some of the whales were traveling very spread out throughout the day, other times bunching up into groups. Some foraging was observed, including a calf and a juvenile both with a salmon in their mouth, but no fish scales were collected today to determine fish species or stocks.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:05 -</b> Watching from <b>sunset hill park</b> viewpoint above shilshole. Tracking about 5 heading south, closer to <b>Bainbridge </b>side but few midchannel.
<br/>Jill Irwin
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:04 -</b> We are at Golden Gardens too. See them sightline passing <b>Fay Bainbridge</b> spread out in a couple of loose groups...lots of surface activity. breaches, porpoising...still southbound! Ed said Brad has his poop scooping net : )
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 pm -</b>  I'm at <b>Fay Bainbridge</b>. Very spread out. Some out if sight to the south, others still coming from the north. Research boat is slightly south west of me.
<br/>Connie Bickerton
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:56 - </b>I can see them with binocs from <b>Golden Gardens</b>. If you can find the research boat off the north end of Bainbridge you'll see them.
<br/>Jon Scanlon
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:21 -</b> Updates from whale watchers seeing the orcas now off <b>Fay Bainbridge Park</b> and across from <b>Carkeek Park</b>, north of Seattle, on the mainland.
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>*<br/>
Heard <b>Orcas </b>at approx. <b>2115 </b>hrs both traveling and playing or feeding going south to north off <b>Mouat Point on Pender Island</b> (48 deg 46 x123 deg 19). No idea about numbers or duration, as I had just stepped outside after walking the dog, but I could hear more than a few travelling both north and south of our location. I continued to listen until 2130. I believe I heard an older and younger Orca playing or feeding at this location for that 15 minute period time before moving north.

<b>7:44 pm -</b> What an amazing, fantastic day Marilyn and I just had at<b> Bush Point</b>! We waited for over 2 hours, were freezing cold, wet and hungry. Had just decided to give up and head towards home unless we heard anymore reports. We were just a couple blocks up the hill where we could see south over the water...and there were blows galore! So we high tailed it back down to the beach. What a sight! Many, many orca spread out, at first circling and chasing fish. After about 15 minutes or so of that, there were still more coming from the south, and they continued to circle and feed. Soon, they apparently were feeling well fed enough to play around a bit. We started seeing many breaches all around and across the channel, some closer to us, some far over near the other side. And then, a tug boat came thru...suddenly there were at least 3 orca chasing and surfing the wake of the tug! One caught up to the tug, and was surfing not more than probably about 30 ft behind it! ...an amazing sight to see. We took photos, but haven't had a chance to download and see what we got. I did shot video of some of the surfing, but not sure how it will turn out.

Our afternoon trip started out  with the possibility of <b>two transients way out near Race Rocks</b>, west of Victoria. So we headed out across Haro Strait toward Victoria. At about ten miles before we get to Race, we hear over the radio that the other boats have lost the Ts. Ok! We slow down and we start scanning and slowly moving west. Then we hear that wonderful word. CONTACT! But the <b>Ts are 5 miles west of Race Rocks</b>. When you've come this far, you go for it. We reached the<b> Transient Orcas, about 10 of them</b>. Great! Even though they were elusive, the water was amazingly calm and the Olympics as a backdrop were stunning. Even for a short visit, lovely. Just before we leave to head back toward our dock, we heard that Residents have been sighted. How could we pass that up. It turns out to be large numbers of L Pod plus K21, were near Beachy Bay headed east (see above report). We even sighted <b>several humpbacks</b> but didn't have time to get close. What an afternoon! And as it turned out, early evening. A long, wonderful voyage.

No whales yesterday, but we did see lots of <b>Dall's porpoise</b>, and amazing country. Today, just as we were leaving the dock we heard over the radio, "Contact!" Ts at the top of <b>President Channel</b>. Great afternoon with the <b>T100s </b>and then we went up toward <b>Patos </b>to get a quick look at the <b>T30s</b>. Just about to head home and then they turned and headed toward the Patos Light. Couldn't leave! I love Orcas with lighthouses!

Ocean Ecoventures of Cowichan Bay, Vancouver Island is reporting seeing all the <b>Southern Residents</b> today somewhere near their vicinity.
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>Residents </b>were picked up late this morning <b>near East Point heading towards Pt. Roberts</b>. Meanwhile out west we had <b>11 Humpback Whales off Sooke</b>, including one that breached:) As if that was not enough the <b>T2's and T49A</b> were found just <b>west of Race Rocks </b>and they were attacking a Harbor Seal! Epic day on the water:)

<b>8:30 am - The minke whales </b>are still in the straits (<b>north of Port Townsend</b>), feeding on the fish balls. Perhaps one or two adults and a juvenile?

Made it just in time to see the <b>southern residents passing Keystone, Whidbey Island</b> today - spotted a big dorsal fin as we were launching the boat. It didn't take long to see more whales heading north towards a couple of whale watch boats, with Howie Garrett and Florian Graner nearby. Sea conditions were perfect, calm with no wind, and with the engine turned off we could hear those wonderful blows. Whales everywhere, ahead of us, either side of us, coming up behind us on yet another glorious October day. I've had my whale 'fix' before leaving for the UK to talk about the southern residents at Whale Fest.
<br/>Sandy Pollard
<br/>*<br/>
Florian Graner and I launched under heavy overcast skies just before noon from the south end of Whidbey Island after hearing a report from Ken Balcomb that the <b>orcas were north of Point No Point, headed north</b>. We found the first dorsal fins just <b>south of Bush Point at 1:15</b>. They were spread out across Admiraly Inlet, with many close to the Whidbey side. I rapidly fired off ID shots as Florian alternately shot stills and HD footage, some mixed with incredible vocals through a hydrophone. We hop-scotched along as small groups and singles appeared at random all around us, ever northward <b>past Lagoon Point</b>. As we approached the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry lane the clouds lifted and blue skies spread across the horizon. From <b>Admiral's Cove to Port Townsend Bay</b> dorsals continually rose with the mighty whooosh of orca breath, only to glide back beneath the glassy surface. For miles in all directions breaches were seen and heard, with occasional spy-hops and taillobs animating the flat water, as ferries sailed past. We had the feeling of accompanying a meandering tribe of foraging orcas making their way to parts unknown (to us). It was hard to know how many were ahead or behind us at any time, but by the angled sun at about <b>5:15 pm we were roughly 2 miles SW of Smith Island</b>, or 6-8 miles south of Lopez Is., and it was time to head back.
<br/>Howard Garrett
<br/>*<br/>
Some of the <b>SRKW's today in Admiralty Inlet</b>. What a treat to spend several hours with them as they slowly meandered northward, <b>between Bush Point and Ebey's Landing</b>, spread out across the entire Inlet. Granny, Blackberry, Speiden and Polaris were the easy ones to recognize but there were many many whales out there.
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>*<br/>
I thought I would report sighting what appeared to be <b>two pods of Orcas</b>, at least they were quite a distance apart from one another. I was fishing at <b>Lagoon Point</b> when we sighted them. Not yet being aware of the kind of information you like to observe, I can only say that the first pod seemed to have five Orcas and one of them definitely had a very large fin (male). They were traveling south to north and if I recall correctly it was shortly after high tide (<b>1:41pm</b>) and not long after a submarine had just gone by heading out to sea. They were not playing or delaying, but traveling north at a pretty good clip. We spotted them south of the beach and lost track of them after the<b> Port Townsend area</b>. They were too far out to see any markings, pretty much in the shipping lanes. Hope that info is helpful.
<br/>Bob Nuerenberg
<br/>*<br/>
Observed what appeared to be <b>8 to 10 orcas moving north very slowly between Bush Point and Lagoon Point at between 12:50 and 1:15pm</b>. Lots of tail slapping, spy hopping and a couple of good breaches. Fun to watch!
<br/>Vicki Claude
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:10 - </b>Karen Anderson called from <b>south of Bush Point, Whidbey Island</b>, while watching many orcas very close to shore, breaching, spyhopping and very active.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>About 25 Transients, the T30s, 90s, 100s, 101s </b>and more,  at the west end of <b>Galiano Island, BC. Porlier Pass</b>.

Florian Graner and I departed Holmes Harbor just after 11 am and saw the first dorsals <b>south of Edmonds at about 12:30</b>. They were completely spread across Puget Sound, meandering and foraging as they moved slowly southward. The highlight was when 8 to 10 orcas surfed a large wake from a big container ship as it spread across the Sound. They were mostly submerged, just black and white forms through the watery lens, with just the tips of dorsals ripping the surface at great speed as they were propelled along, angling forward to maximize the rush. Further south we found that a few orcas, including baby<b> J49, had meandered into Elliot Bay</b> and seemed to like it there, maybe feasting on chum waiting for a good rain to head up the Duwamish River to spawn.
<br/>Howard Garrett
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:31 -</b> they're just passing the south end of <b>Blake Island</b> right now. Should be crossing the Fauntleroy ferry lane shortly in the setting sun. Epic. Although they are TEENY TINY from my house. I can still see them though!
<br/>Krista Larson Billinghurst
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Resident Orca</b> morning to sundown: First from Edmonds watched the orca mid channel <b>between Point No Point and Whidbey</b>, then moved to <b>Carkeek</b>, then <b>Golden Gardens</b> as we watched them foraging, breaching, porpoising, and meandering their way south down Puget Sound, past <b>Bainbridge and around Alki/Blake Island </b>on towards Vashon by sundown.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
Saw <b>several orca </b>behind my house (just south of<b> Alki lighthouse in west seattle</b>) this evening around <b>5</b>, but there were likely more than that present (just not all surfacing at once). They were just west of weather watch park in West Seattle (4035 Beach Dr SW seattle WA). They swam around for a long time just north of blake island, but eventually <b>headed south towards Tacoma</b>. I saw them around <b>6:30-7:30</b> this evening. They were probably feeding, as they hung around a long time in this area. A few breached (jumped out of the water), but mostly, they just porpoised occasionally in the area. Males?: I think so, but I am no expert. Definitely there were some with dorsal fins *much* larger than others.
<br/>Joel Zylberberg
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5-10 (or more!) orcas</b> spotted heading south at <b>4:45pm</b> today, crossing in front of the <b>Bainbridge-Seattle ferry</b>! It was amazing!
<br/>Maggie Pettit
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:35 - </b>from <b>Carkeek </b>can see them across more on Kitsap side, some just off <b>Fay Bainbridge park</b> and others in<b> port Madison </b>and off <b>Jefferson PT</b>. still south bound.
<br/><b>12:40 pm -</b> the o<b>rcas are spread out from just N of Kingston to about 5 miles south</b>, with lots of foraging and tail slapping going on.
<b>Noon - orcas all over, between Edmonds and Kingston</b>, some tail slaps, still heading south.
<br/><b>10:43 -</b> I see activity both north and southbound shipping lanes <b>between Pt No Pt and Scatchet head</b>. Still far off from my vantage and pretty hazy out there.
<br/><b>10:28 -</b> from Edmonds: finally spotted activity south of <b>Pt No Pt </b>that side of mid channel. Quite a few breaches.
<br/>Alisa Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:32 -</b> Watched them from the <b>Kingston/Edmonds ferry</b> and then watched them for 30 minutes from the beach in <b>Edmonds</b>. Looks like they are heading south.

<b>12:15 -</b> Maya, with WA State Ferries called to relay a report from the <b>Edmonds Ferry</b> - a <b>large pod of orcas hanging out off Edmonds at 12:15 pm</b>, foraging, possibly heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:37 am -</b> A large group of <b>Orcas went by Pt. no Pt -heading south</b>. They were quite a ways out probably closer to Whidbey Island.

<br/>*<br/>
I live at the USGS Station in <b>Fort Flagler State Park </b>at the north end of <b>Marrowstone Island</b>. A coworker and I spotted <b>a very large group of orcas traveling South</b> at little after <b>7 am.</b> They were traveling in two groups and we estimated <b>the total number to be around 60</b> but we weren't sure if it was one large spread out group, or two distinct groups. They were porpoising the entire time and had at least two babies that we could see as well as a few males. They were too far away to see any individual markings or to take photos. Orcas this far south in the sound are fairly rare, they're usually seen once or twice a year here at the station but never in such large numbers. Hope this info helps!

What a way to spend Canadian thanksgiving! We got an early report of <b>T's heading west along Valdes Island</b>. We headed up that way and a few miles east of <b>Ballenas Island, in the Strait of Georgia, we saw the T30's</b>. The water was so beautifully flat and the whales were traveling in a tight group.  The whales were traveling about 8 knots for the last 20 minutes of our trip heading northwest! They were on a mission to get somewhere, I heard about an hour later they joined up with approximately 12 more whales. Nothing like flat seas and T's during the day and a turkey dinner at night.

Love it that the <b>So. Residents are already checking out the restored Elwha river</b>, along with the salmon who have wasted no time going up the river before the dam removals are even completed! At least there are whales around. <b>J Pod and K Pod are at the Elwha River </b>right now while<b> L Pod coming in from Victoria</b>. <b>2 Humpbacks were in San Juan Channel </b>this <b>morning </b>but have since exited though Cattle Pass and into Haro strait. There are <b>Transient orcas up north as well</b>.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 Transient Orcas were seen 7 miles east of Sekiu</b>, and they were heading East along the kelp beds. There was at least one male (large dorsal fin) and they were aggressively hunting seals (throwing one of them into the air). I did not see the Orcas personally, but I got several first hand accounts and saw one video which was recorded by a fisherman who got much too close to the group of Orcas.

We were hiking around <b>Turn Island (outside Friday Harbor)</b>- and heard a strange notice - almost siren like - heard it again and saw a whale come up out of the water and just saw the tail as it went under - fluke like - <b>humpback</b>?
At approx 11:30am.  We heard the trumpeting sound several more times working its way around Turn Island in the direction of the point - but did not see it.

I live on the bluff at <b>North Beach, Port Townsend</b>. All day Sunday, there were <b>minkes in the Salish Sea between the Olympic Peninsula and the San Juans</b>. I've lived here for 7 years, and have never seen more than a rare glimpse of a loner. From <b>11am until the sun set</b>, especially in late afternoon, I saw several dozen surfacings. It was very hard to tell how many whales there were. They seemed to be going back and forth; there were some that were recognizable as pairs, some looked to be alone. I had the binoculars on a fish ball full of gulls when suddenly all dispersed and a 4' or so dorsal fin appeared and disappeared. No other sign of orcas, though.

<b>Transients T049's</b> yesterday by <b>Darcy Island</b> (I heard T036's also?), <b>6-8 whales</b>, beautiful views with glass-like conditions. Also we had a wonderful encounter with <b>Dall's porpoise</b> on the return trip, they make everybody feel happy! A branded <b>Steller sea lion</b> also at Whale Rocks - he was born at St. George Reef in California (the "Y" on his number was the giveaway clue).
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:00PM -</b> approximately <b>6 T's west of Kelp Reef </b>(48°30.86N, 123°16.48W) traveling south. Another busy day on the water with all the familiar faces of the Salish Sea. In addition to watching Transient Killer Whales south of D'arcy Island, British Columbia (48°30.86N, 123°16.48W), we also came across a lone <b>California Sea Lion</b>. He was floating with just his head, hind flippers, and one pectoral flipper out of the water, a strategy sea lions use to regulate their body temperature in these frigid 48°F waters. On our way home we picked up a large pod of <b>Dall's Porpoises</b>. When Captain Craig slowed the boat to 7 knots, we watched their "rooster tail" splashes as they turned to converge on our bow. We were all in awe as we observed their chunky bodies of solid muscle zig zag around our bow and then breach to the side for a quick breath before taking another pass across our wake. I could watch those critters all day! There were fewer <b>Steller's Sea Lions</b> hauled out on Whale Rocks today, but more were milling in the water. We were impressed by a few individuals that were breaching completely out of the water. As was the case for yesterday, the Transients we observed stayed in a tight, slow-moving formation as they performed approximately 5 minute foraging dives. We tried our best to parallel the group as they made their way in a southerly direction toward Victoria; however, after one long dive they popped up right alongside our boat. We shut down and listened to them breath and prepare for their next stealth dive.
