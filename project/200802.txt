<h3><center>February 2008 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>February 29, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
Richard Lyons called the Orca Network with a report of <b>orcas </b>off Clinton, S. Whidbey Island. They were in 30 fathoms of water.
<br/>*<br/>
A pod of about 6 to 9 whales (<b>orcas</b>) came by our house today, <b>10:00 AM</b>. One mile west of the Sekiu River, WA state about 1/4 mile offshore heading west. I saw 2 juveniles.
<br/>Paul Blake
<br/><i>We sent Paul's photos to Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research, &amp; he has ID'd them as L pod!
<br/>It's L pod! Whales appearing in the photos include L47, L55, L86, L90, and L26. Others are there too. Very cool since J pod decided to come in.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research</i>
<br/>*<br/>
John Boyd called at <b>2:14 pm</b> to relay a report from Mallard of Victoria, of a pod of <b>orcas </b>heading east off Victoria. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed the pod had been ID'd as <b>J pod</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
I just got a call (~<b>3:45 pm</b>) from Ron Bates. He had gotten a call from Mallard who was out on King Salmon, and they were following <b>J Pod</b> across the Victoria water front headed east toward San Juan Island.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Calls on the San Juan Island hydrophones (Orcasound.net) right now (<b>5:56 pm</b>) !!! <b>J Pod</b> north up Haro Strait now.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, Friday Harbor 
<br/><br/>
<b>February 28, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
On our way home tonight from a great trip to Baja to play with the gray whales, we asked a ferry worker on board the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry if any grays had been sighted yet. He hadn't seen one, but said other ferry crew members saw a <b>gray whale</b> a few hours earlier - mid-afternoon, in Possession Sound!
<br/>Susan &amp; Howard, Orca Network, Whidbey Island
<br/><br/>
<b>February 27, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
Richard Lyons called the Orca Network with a report of a pod of 6 - 8 <b>orcas </b>off Clinton, S. Whidbey Island. They were in 30 fathoms of water. He also heard reports that others had seen the orcas on Friday.
<br/><br/>
<b>February 17, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
While fishing off Church Rock at <b>9 am</b> this morning, observed a playful pod of 8 to 10 <b>orcas </b>breaching and tail-slapping between Church Rock and Swordfish Isand at the west end of Whirl Bay (Southern tip of Vancouver Island). They were headed east towards the Race.
<br/>Ted Litster. Victoria, B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> going east off Victoria around <b>1400</b>, hoping for more details later.
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
Finally a whale report. <b>J POD</b> !!!!!!!!!! We located J pod crossing the Oak Bay area(Victoria) bucking a big ebb tide with the help of a on shore whale enthusiast. They were last sighted at <b>1600 </b>heading for San Juan. 
<br/>beemer, Victoria, B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
We've had OrcaSound.net on ever since we got the reports of <b>J pod</b> heading east. Nothing for an hour or two, then suddenly at about <b>8:30 pm</b> a bunch of very loud calls on the OrcaSound (NW San Juan Island) hydrophone - and then - nothing! We're still listening hoping for a few more calls - tune in, &amp; let us know if you hear them tonight, or see them on Monday!
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

<br/><br/>
More info. on the Pender Island orca Sighting: The <b>Orca </b>was well into the channel heading east close to shore just off susan pt. Its the first time I've seen one this close here - I normally see them across the channel off dinner pt. on mayne headed towards active pass.
<br/>Andy Paige 
<br/>*<br/>
In regards to a lone <b>orca </b>sighted on the morning of Feb 13th, thought I might be able to provide a bit more info: I was catching the first Swartz Bay to Tsawassen ferry and at around 8am the captain announced killer whales in the area. I went out on the deck and spotted a lone orca that appeared to be foraging in the area between the southern entrance to Active Pass, Prevost Island and Mayne Island. From my observation the orca had quite a tall erect dorsal fin, slightly wavy with a rounded tip. I am certain the dorsal fin had a slight "waviness" to it and was definitely a rounded tip. I'm only an amateur at identification but this fin certainly displayed the characteristics of a resident fin, and I'm pretty sure it was not a transient. On my time at Beam Reach last fall we often witnessed (as I'm sure you all have), J1 leading the pod by what seems to be up to a couple of miles. So I was thinking that perhaps this lone individual orca could have been J1, as I have seen J1 quite a few times and from the distance of my observation 200-300m, it did appear to look similar to Ruffles. I did look around for other fins but by this time the ferry had turned up Active Pass so I did not see any. Having said all this, this lone orca could have in fact been a transient but I thought that transients had very distinct triangular dorsal fins with a prominent "sharp tip". Anyone have any thoughts on this? Cheers,
<br/>Tim Hunt (former Beam Reach student &amp; aspiring to work in Vic whale watch industry this season)

<b>7:15 am</b> spotted one solitary <b>Orca </b>off Stanley point on Pender Island just inside the mouth of navy channel.

I'm hearing [<b>orca</b>] calls and clicks on Lime Kiln (Orcasound Hydrophone) now (<b>8:21 am</b> your time).
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Key Largo
<br/>*<br/>
We had a report of [<b>orcas</b>] off Victoria this afternoon just after <b>noon</b>, this should be in keeping with your report off Lime Kiln this morning. The area was searched but no luck.
<br/>Ron Bates, Marine Mammal Research Group, Victoria BC

<br/><br/>
I was talking to a fisherman out of <b>Ft Bragg CA</b> yesterday and he reported seeing one medium sized <b>orca </b> about 5 miles NW of Pt Cabrillo (just south of Ft. Bragg, N. Calif).
<br/>Brad Hanson, NOAA's NWFSC
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
I heard about 10 minutes of <b>transient </b>calls on my hydrophones, OrcaSound (NW San Juan Island), this evening at about <b>7 pm.</b>
I'll attach a small WAV file. The T call is followed immediately by the sound of a wave breaking on our shore. It is *quite* windy here this evening.

The same juvenile <b>humpback </b>that I saw on Saturday, 2/2/08, was seen this <b>afternoon </b>off of Bellevue Pt. San Juan Island, by Ken Balcomb. I went out to see if I could get a better shot of the underside of the fluke so that it might be identified. It was feeding in erratic directions, so I didn't get the shot I wanted.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Chaters, San Juan Island 
<br/><br/>
<b>February 3, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
Dave Ellifrit and I went out and found the <b>Js </b>right at Navy Ch. just south of Active Pass and took them into active a bit. Every year when I see J1 and 2 for the first time I sure get the chills. 
Ron Bates said Js were seen at <b>dusk </b>near Tawassan.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Marti Tilley of North Pender Island, B.C., reporting a pod of 6 - 7 <b>orcas </b>in Swanson Channel, mid- channel, heading north off Mouat Pt. at <b>9:25 am</b>. The pod included 1 adult male. 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report that Jim Maya &amp; Dave Ellifrit had found the above reported <b>orcas </b>&amp; it's J pod! They had them at <b>11:05 am</b> heading north through Active Pass.
<br/>*<br/>
A pod of approximately 15 [<b>orcas</b>] entered Active Pass northbound at <b>11:15 am</b>. I watched them feeding for some 15 minutes off Helen Point before they entered the Pass. They were very active, with quite a bit of surface activity. It appeared to be the pod with 2 adult males. Once in the Pass, they travelled fairly directly through.

<b>February 2, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
We picked up the juvenile <b>humpback </b>right off of Henry Island (N. San Juans) on about <b>1400 </b>hrs. I had just gotten through saying to my passengers that if they come back in late summer or in the fall I could show them humpbacks, but not at this time of the year, and boom, I saw the first blow about 200 yds off my port. He zigged and zagged for about an hour feeding off of south Kellet Bluff and then we left him/her. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Chaters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb called to relay a report he'd just received of Southern Resident <b>orcas </b>in <b>Monterey Bay CA</b> at <b>12:40 pm</b>. ID's confirmed are L57 &amp; L41. 
<br/>*<br/>
Sarah Graham of <b>Monterey, CA</b>, called at <b>12:51 pm</b> to report Southern Resident <b>orcas </b>in Monterey Bay. 
<br/>*<br/>
Today we saw the <b>residents</b>, about 40 or so very spread out in <b>Monterey Bay</b>. They approached within a mile of the aquarium then turned and headed to NW still spread over 1 plus miles.
