<b>J Pod</b> was picked up late in the day coming in and reportedly hit the <b>west side of San Juan Island shortly before sunset</b>.  -Monika Wieland Shields 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Fri Aug 31 - Today we saw maybe <b>5 orcas while being on ferry from Tsawassen to Victoria</b>. Exact location was next to Salt Spring Island. 48.7667748, -123.3784403 Have a great day! -Marcel Haczek

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Fri Aug 31 - <b>T137A, T137D, and T137 charging east in the Juan de Fuca Strait</b> in the <b>afternoon</b>. -Photo by Mark Malleson, 2018 
  
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>	

Fri Aug 31 - <b>19:46 - Watching a group of at least 7 Orca heading north past Waldron</b> on the Eastside of Waldron. -Roxane Jackson Johnson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>17:20 - Now reportedly in Roche Harbor</b>
<br/><b>16:00 - T36As and T99s</b> are on the west side of Haro, currently coming east aiming at <b>San Juan County Park</b>. -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>	

Fri Aug 31 -<b> T65As (minus T65A3 &amp; T65A4)</b> - I was listening to the Orcas from the <b>West shore of Day Island</b>. They were off the Northeast shore of Fox Island from about <b>10:30-11:15 pm</b> Friday. Sounds like they had a kill. Tail slapping and lots of blows in the same area for about a half hour or more. I'm pretty sure they went <b>North towards Tacoma around 11:15</b>. A train and a passing barge made too much noise but it sounded like they were heading North under the <b>Narrows Bridge at 11:20</b> or so. Here is a video of some of the blows I heard. You can't see anything but you can definitely hear the Orcas. -Karen Caldwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>18:00 - Saw 4 near Cutts Island in Henderson Bay</b>. Looked like two adult and two smaller ones. (heading south). -Doug Brennan

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:56 -</b> They were headed through <b>Balch Passage</b> a few minutes ago.
<br/><b>11:39 - headed east toward Eagle Island</b>, between McNeil and Anderson Islands. -
<br/><b>11:29 - SW of McNeil nearing Filucy Bay</b>. -Erica White

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

The Orca Network's (volunteer) text alert woke me up with news I had orcas heading my way. I managed to get out the door quickly and spent from <b>8:30-9:30am</b> watching them head our way and pass the east side of <b>Anderson Island</b>, heading south. <b>T65A2</b> was on a trajectory to come close to us on shore, but turned and rejoined his mom and siblings to pass closer to Ketron Island. What an amazing way to start the day! <b>T65A5</b> (4 yr old) and baby <b>T65A6</b> (first seen 4/20/18) with Mama <b>T65A</b> (32 yrs old). <b>T65A2</b> (14 yr old male) with Fox Island and Narrows Bridge in the background. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>08:28 -</b> There are <b>orcas at the south end of Fox Island</b>. - Cheryl Wagner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>07:30 -</b> Fisherman Curt reported <b>orcas swam by his boat near Fox Island</b> heading south. -Carey Kirkland

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>07:15 - Orcas just south of Narrows Bridge heading south</b>. I'm a bit far up on the hillside so hard to tell how many...<b>at least two</b>. Such an amazing thing to see first thing this morn! -Christina Finn

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Email received at <b>19:38 - 2 orca whales in Elliott Bay</b> South of Raye Street. Several boats gathered to watch - they were there over an hour. -Fredericka Foster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Not sure if your researchers would be interested but we saw <b>2 whales</b> in front of our house just west and close to shore of <b>Elliott Bay Marina</b> in Seattle on Friday evening. Unfortunately it looks like we only caught one in our pictures. Any idea who they are from the fins? We did see a couple of harbor seals swimming around about 15-30 minutes before the whales, but haven't seen them since the whale sightings. We have lived here for 8 years and have never seen whales so close to the shore before. We are quite interested especially since our trip to San Juans with an afternoon of whale watching in June where we saw several whales. So any information you can share would be appreciated. T65A3 glides passed the Elliot Bay Marina heading towards downtown Seattle. -Troy Sorensen
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>19:14 - Orcas </b>off of four mile rock (<b>Magnolia</b>). Just <b>north of Elliot Bay </b>Marina. Transients hunting. No direction. -Joey LaMarche

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>19:30 - </b>I was in a kayak off <b>Magnolia</b>, saw the<b> two Orcas</b> just off W McGraw Shoreline Street End south of Discovery park. They were in the same area for about 15 minutes at around 7:30 pm. Headed south from there. -Thaddaus Huber

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>18:32 - T65A3 &amp; T65A4</b> have made at least one kill since being here
<br/><b>18:21 - T65A3 &amp; T65A4</b> southbound just south of Discovery Park.
<br/><b>17:50 - Still off Shilshole</b> trending south. We found them and can confirm it is <b>T65A3 and 4</b>. -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:56 p.m. - Two heading south just outside Shilshole Marina</b>. -Sarah Waugh

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:15 -</b> Saw <b>two orca whales</b> right in front of our camp in north <b>Edmonds</b>, right between Meadowdale and Picnic Point! -Photo by Jess Dame, Aug 31, 2018 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:09 - Two orcas</b> approached the dock at the Beach Camp at <b>Sunset Bay between Mukilteo and Edmonds</b>, very close to the dock and beach where 60 campers and many staff were able to see them for about five minutes. Photos are posted at that facebook page but so far no saddle patches have been posted. The RP, Francie Dailer, suggested they were the missing <b>T065A3 &amp; 4</b>. Hopefully more photos will be posted there. The whales were heading south and last seen of Meadowdale Beach. -Beach Camp at Sunset Bay. 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:09 - T65A4</b> close in shore just off <b>Beach Camp on Sunset Bay</b> - north of Edmonds this morning. -Photo by Francie Dailer, Aug 31, 2018

<b>11:08 - Humpback 1.5 NM west of Indian Point</b>, south Whidbey Island. -Trevor Tillman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:21 - Humpback CS631/CRC16017 Two Spot - off South Whidbey.</b> We were out on Red Head today and I got these two shots of<b> Two Spot</b>. The captain Trevor can give you GPS. They asked that I send these to you. -Jay Syverson, Port Ludlow, WA
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 
 
Fri Aug 31 - <b>18:30 - whale spouts seen in Case Inlet</b>, between Heron and Harstine Island. Currently heading south. Also seen <b>earlier today around 3pm</b> in similar location. Not orca. Much bigger, no idea what kind. (Carla Jones: David's wife here. I told him to post it was a small gray whale, but he refused because it was too far away to really know. But that's my vote.) -David Morton 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Gray whale </b>out front again this morning. It headed south <b>toward Boston Harbor and Budd Inlet</b>, in a set of slow and determined surfacing series - marked by robust blows. It then turned west and headed across the <b>tip of Cooper Point spit</b> where it remained for about 30 minutes - in what appeared to be feeding behavior. Slow surfacing and shallow breathing marked by a head here, a pectoral fin there, and tail fluke tip someplace else. It then started to travel south <b>into Eld Inlet</b> - where the first surface was highlighted by a robust blow as well as the startling of a dozen mergansers! It kept south for a short distance (about a mile) and then turned around and headed north again. As it passed in front of the house, it started to angle north east where I lost sight of it after its determined surfacing series - marked by robust blows again - as it traveled. Grateful! -Kim Merriman

Thu Aug 30 - The <b>Humpback Comeback west of Sooke </b>continues! What a great morning visiting over 20 Gentle Giants today. I tried to get as many ID Fluke Shots as possible. A few I recognize but a new calf I believe. So little time, so many whales! Lighting, non-flukes, missed shots, fog, made it tricky but did my best! Stunning whale: underside fluke of<b> Humpback CS298 aka BCZ0366 "Caspian"</b>. <b>Humpback CS246 aka CRC-15995 "Lyra" Humpback who has been through some rough times: BCYUnk "Chop Saw"</b>. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell

Thu Aug 30 - OR Coast - This is a picture my husband took yesterday in <b>Pacific City, OR</b>. We saw some sort of whale species right off of Cape Kiwanda. The picture is the fin. In addition to the fin, we saw blows in the area. This was the only one we saw and it hung around for quite some time. The folks at the restaurant said humpbacks and grey whales hang out in the area, but is this the correct fin for one of those? I understand the picture is taken from a distance, but if anybody knows anything, it's you folks! -Ronda Barrow Hempler
Probable gray whale feeding (fin tip) with birds watching from the bluff above. -Report by Rhond Hempler, Photo by Don Hempler, Aug 30, 2018

Wed Aug 29 - <b>13:22 - Orcas In Port Angeles Harbor</b> right now, They seem to be just doing circles. Turned out to be an adult and a juvenile. (adult male and female, possibly T11s) I don't have any idea how to identify them. -Christina Baze

Wed Aug 29 - From the<b> Port Townsend ferry</b>, sailing toward Whidbey Island, at<b> 1:25</b>, I saw <b>four orcas</b>--three females and one male. They were in the midst of what I believe was a bait ball. There was a large flock of frantic gulls and birds at the surface, and the orcas rose in the midst of them. They hung around there for 2-3 minutes, then dove, and I was unable to find them again. -Peter Wayne Moe 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Aug 29 - <b>19:57 - Right now off Point No Point</b> Beach a whale came up for a breath. It was so close that I felt the spray from it. My husband says there are three. I only saw one. She did confirm <b>humpback</b>. -Jennifer Plenge

UNCONFIRMED CETACEANS - Tue Aug 28 - Email received<b> 18:25 - We are off Johnson Point near Olympia</b>. Saw what seemed to be smaller orca breach and blowing. Also porpoises feeding. Seems porpoises are going back and forth. Orca seemed to be alone and is gone....What we reported last night was not these guys. What we saw was much larger, with really white sides. We did not see the head. But we got a glimpse  of  a white underbelly. Really stocky body. After spending several hours on line looking at pictures and info we think maybe what we saw was one or two  Dall's Porpoises. -Judith Judd
<br/>(<i>leaving as unidentified with reporting party leaning Dall's. Common dolphins was proposed by ON as possiblity - alb</i>)

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Mon Aug 27 - <b>17:52 - I've relocated to Dugualla Bay area. T65A3 &amp; T65A4</b> are still north of here but slowly moving south. They are absolutely tail slap happy as they've been traveling today.   
<br/><b>16:54 - T65A3 and T65A4 southbound along Ala Spit </b>now. Several harbor seals and a Steller sea lion hanging out close to shore watching.
<br/><b>16:32 - </b>Lots of gulls diving in now.
<br/><b>16:20 - seems like they have made a kill</b>. Milling and lots of splashing, tail slapping. Viewing from <b>Ala Spit</b>, they're currently north of me. -Rachel Haight

Today around <b>noon</b>, Aug 27th, I was fishing off <b>Young Island, in Burrows Bay, Fidalgo Island </b>and sighted <b>a single orca traveling west</b>. It broke the surface several times and made the distinctive noise from its blowhole. It was quite large, and I know the difference between orcas and porpoises.

Interestingly, for the second year in a row, <b>T65A3 and T65A4</b>, a young brother-sister pair, have broken off from the rest of their family group for at least several days. This afternoon the two of them passed close to shore off <b>Lime Kiln heading north</b>.

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Fri Aug 24 - WOW! These special Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales <b>J Pod, J38 Cookie &amp; L87 Onyx made a quick crossing of the Juan De Fuca Strait</b> to be very close to Point No Point <b>west of Sooke</b> on our next adventure! They were all spread out foraging. Again it was great to only have 2-3 boats around who were happy to keep their distance to just enjoy the day! They quickly turned west and headed out to sea...SEPTEMBER is MY favorite! Heading east slowly as they foraged on Chinook Salmon. Very special to be the only boat around for miles-Paul Pudwell

Wed Aug 22 - Trip Report: Still very smokey as we left the marina, but got a report of Orcas off Dungeness Spit, so we headed southwest. We caught up with the <b>T65A group of Biggs (meat-eating) Orcas at Protection Island</b>, and followed them into Discovery Bay. This matriline consists of T65A, the matriarch (b. 1986), son T65A2 (2004: just 14 and very big!), T65A3 (2007), T65A4 (2011) and new calf T65A5 (born April 2018). T65A and 3 of the others were heading into Discovery Bay, with long down times, and T65A2 was bringing up the rear. He made a kill of a harbor porpoise without too much seeming effort, and proceeded towards the others though still behind. It was lovely to see this tight family, with the darling calf looking fat and energetic. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

J50/Scarlet Update (8/20): Response teams spent about three hours on Saturday (8/18) monitoring J50/Scarlet as J Pod returned to the Salish Sea on the way towards San Juan Island. Biologists aboard a  SeaDoc Society vessel reported J50/Scarlet actively socializing with the rest of the pod, a hint that her condition may be improving slightly. She fell behind the pod as the whales swam east, but University of Washington saw  her rejoin her mother (J16/Slick) and sister (J42/Echo) to forage near <b>Hannah Heights on the west side of San Juan Island.</b> University of Washington also collected two fecal samples from the group. -Photo by Katy Foster/NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Sightings Sunday (8/19) reported J Pod headed west again, back <br/>toward open ocean</div></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>. The plan going forward is to administer another dose of antibiotic through a dart and, if possible, a second dart with dewormer to reduce parasitic worms that can harm emaciated marine mammals like J50/Scarlet and that were found in the recent fecal samples from three whales including J50. The veterinary team believes another dose of antibiotic remains the priority to treat potential infection since the first dart on 8/9 delivered only a half dose. This demonstrates that darting a swimming killer whale with thick skin, particularly on the fins and flukes, from a rocking boat is challenging. To ensure that J50/Scarlet receives the medication, veterinarians may switch to a collared needle with a ridge that holds it in place long enough to deliver the full dose. This type of dart is commonly used to treat wildlife, such as elephants, and will fall out in time. <b>J50/Scarlet swims next to her mother, J16/Slick. </b>-Photo by Katy Foster/NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Once outside the cove, this family of four circled and milled for a while mid channel before eventually moving on to the northeast. Prior to this video, we had the opportunity to <b>ring the whale bell on the Coupeville Wharf</b> and make some heartfelt connections with dozens of residents and visitors from around the world who lined the wharf in hopes of a glimpse. After some very long down times the orcas finally did surface to the west. We had some wonderful discussions and impromptu Q &amp; A. The whales went as far as the mussel rafts then flipped and headed right back out the cove. <b>Bigg's Transients T100s - Penn Cove</b>, Whidbey Island - Aug 19, 2018. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Sat Aug 18 - Hi ON, Drifting <b>1 mile off False Bay 1900 hrs, <b>J39</b> who looked to be fishing next to us with some echolocation on the hydrophone suddenly took off in close pursuit of a porpoise. J22 closer to shore was also in pursuit of another porpoise.</b> While <b>J22</b> was engaged with a porpoise <b>J37 and J49 </b>were milling nearby by and soon <b>J40</b> came in to join <b>J22. J49</b> began following and became somewhat involved. Off shore there were what seemed to be 3 other chases happening around us, including <b>J22's son, J38</b>, being one of them. Wait 'til the Transients find out about this. -Cheers, Captains Barbara &amp; David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

We spotted a pod of <b>orcas</b> from the coast trail at <b>East Sooke Park</b> yesterday morning (Saturday, Aug. 18). From what I can tell, they were southern resident orcas (maybe J-pod?). We were surprised and dismayed by the plethora of whale watching boats and small motor crafts that were swarming around them, many of which seemed closer than the allowed 200 meters, and a motor boat rushed at full speed right up to where they were. -Louise Alvarez
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

What a special day! We headed out in thick fog and within minutes we heard fisherman talking about Orca...With some help from our locals we were the first to find <b>J Pod off Otter Point</b>...minutes from our Dock. Than within a few minutes the fog lifted and we were able to share the amazing <b>Sooke</b> waterfront with these endangered whales foraging with some very active celebration. <b>J27 Blackberry (born 1991) and J51 Nova (born 2015)</b>..What we have not seen in a while...So GREAT TO SEA!

Younger one started breaching as well, then both engaged in some tail slapping. They stayed split in two groups with T100C group exiting about 17:00 while the others remained for a while and headed out, clearing Baby Island about 17:30...all on northbound course.

We had the perfect ending to a fantastic day of watching three pods of transient killer whales in Saratoga Passage on August 18.  The three families included the <b>T100 pod, T34 pod, T37 &amp; T37B pod</b>.  These 11 orcas were swimming north and south through <b>Saratoga Passage</b>. On the afternoon of the 18th the pods were grouped up very closely in a resting mode until they turned and aimed right <b>towards Baby Island</b>, at the mouth of Holmes Harbor, on Whidbey Island. Baby Island is a local haul out for harbor seals. After a long dive they surfaced and it was immediately obvious that they had caught something - most likely a seal or two. All the killer whales circled around and started getting active and playful. <b>T100C, a 16 year old male</b>, surprised us all when he exploded out of the water with a huge breach, and then he followed that up with two more in a row. Each time he landed with his pectoral fins straight out from his body making it look like he was trying to fly! What a finale to a fantastic day on the water with transient orcas on our newest boat, the Saratoga! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

<br/> Sat Aug 18 - Day two of watching these three families of mammal eating type orcas (the <b>T34s, T37 &amp; T37Bs, &amp; T100s</b>) traveling together off Whidbey Island in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, North Puget Sound. This day, Saturday,  August 18th, the group cruised up and down Saratoga Passage as they did the day prior. This video begins once they turned their sights on <b>Holmes Harbor</b> and made a kill. While watching some of the females and young circling prey a bit south, we heard a loud percussive sound to our right and turned to see big male <b>T100C</b> breaching forward and landing belly-flops! One of the young ones started breaching as well, many tail lobs followed by all for the next several minutes. The first group exited Holmes Harbor, the others followed ~20 minutes later, all proceeded <b>northbound</b> in Saratoga Passage where they all continued together into the darkness this summer evening. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Thu Aug 16 - <b>23:01- </b>Hello! I am Sitting on my deck of a summer rental home. <b>Watauga Beach, Manchester, Wa, Rich Passage</b>, I <b>hear blow hole breathing</b>, really strong breathes. Holy cats! Not a seal or sea lion. Big lungs, making huge ring of the rise, rises. Whale is going back and forth, lunging and flopping. First I zeroed in on one, in the dark! Then, saw there were two others ahead of my initial spot. I saw a Small dorsal fin on one via my binos. There are lots of salmon running through this pass right now. i'll stay up and report more, if more. Here's what struck me: The "largeness" of the splashing; They moved slow and long; once I realized there was more than one, how  spread out they were. lots of loud; The biggee: How loud their breathing was. I've had the great blessing of hearing orcas and their blow holes from our family's boat when we've gone still in the water. As you know, once you hear that sound, you never forget it!! Also, there are many pinniped out front (harbor seals..I believe-)  and I've heard their breathing. This was not them. I really believe this, after a night of sleep: That one dorsal fin, seen by me, in front of the neighbors house, with their porch light helping vision with my binos...was just too big not to be a female orca. Fyi, Not, the big giant male fin. -Kathleen Cage

<b>J50/Scarlet Update</b> (8/17): Test results from the health samples collected from <b>J50/Scarlet</b> are starting to come in from several top laboratories around the country. The first finding comes from a fecal sample collected last weekend from a group of three <b>J Pod whales: J16/Slick, J42/Echo, and J50/Scarlet</b>. It showed moderate levels of Contracaecum, a nematode parasite that has previously been found in killer whales and other marine mammals. The worm is not usually a problem in healthy animals. However, in animals that are emaciated or are otherwise compromised, the parasite can penetrate the stomach lining, introducing bacterial infection to the bloodstream, or it can bore into internal organs. While we cannot be sure the sample came from J50/Scarlet, the veterinary team has updated her treatment priorities to include a dewormer, in addition to an antibiotic. Both have proven successful and safe in other cetaceans. The treatment should help J50/Scarlet by reducing bacterial and parasitic burdens on her system so she can start regaining the weight she has lost. <b>The whales remain in open waters off the west side of Vancouver Island</b>, beyond the reach of the response teams. Fisheries and Oceans Canada and other partners continue their watch for signs of J Pod's return to the more protected waters of the Salish Sea. Updates HERE. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Fri Aug 17 - Whale watchers watching the <b>pods loosely grouped between Hidden Beach, Whidbey and Cama Beach State Park</b>, Camano Island. 
<br/><b>20:00 - </b>We moved to<b> Hidden Beach</b>, Whidbey and could see the pods still well north of us making slow progress while milling and drifting slowly towards Camano side. They seemed fairly committed, but at some point they flipped, made the directional change and started heading north where they continued for a significant distance. Then when almost out of our sight they flipped once again, now back to traveling southbound. The families picked up speed and passed <b>between Hidden Beach and Cama State Park</b> in the waning light which cast beautiful warm hues from orange to purple on the sandy bluffs across the passage on Camano making for a gorgeous backdrop. We left them on course for Camano State Park just to the south.
18:00 - Pod is out from Shangri La Shores mid channel slowly southbound while engaging in some directional changes, circling, and surface activities: tail lobs, breaches, pec slaps in glassy calm seas.

My family and I were headed South from Canada to the US on August 17th, 2018. We were <b>north of Stuart Island and East of Moresby Island</b>, just north of the border. Only one other sailboat was traveling south of us, no whale watching boats. We saw a couple whales in the distance coming our direction headed northbound. We immediately stopped so they could pass. We spotted them a ways off on our port side. A few minutes later, <b>4 orcas</b> surprisingly surfaced within a few feet from our boat. They apparently turned around to come and see us. After swimming around under our boat, the 4 orcas went west to join one orca that seemed to be hanging out on the surface and not moving much. I was able to take a few pictures and compared them to a 2012 report I found online. I identified one of them as <b>T002C, Tasu</b>. I'm assuming she was with<b> 3 of her kiddos</b> when they surfaced near us. I'm assuming the orca just west of us that they joined up with was Tasu's other son, <b>T002C2 Tumbo</b>. He's the one with a curved back, which may explain why he wasn't moving much and just hanging out on the surface. Anyways, sorry for reporting this so late. I hope it helps. It was such an incredible experience that we will never forget! -CarlaRae Arneson

August 16th trip report - With smoky haze still lingering, we headed north in Rosario Strait towards whales, but heard a report of <b>whales much closer - at Deception Pass</b>! We turned back and found <b>Transient/Biggs whales - T101s and T102</b>! We had some amazing views of these 4 whales as they slowly traveled towards Lopez Island. Mom and her 3 kids are in excellent condition, there's lots of food available for them (seals, sea lions, porpoise etc.). Homeward bound we passed many seals hauled out on various rock formations, plus glimpses of harbor porpoise, and always, a few bald eagles.

August 14th trip report - we headed out under foggy/smoky skies, towards <b>Colville Island</b> to check out the harbor seals, some with new pups, caught sight of a Steller sea lion swimming off <b>Iceberg Point</b>, found a few salmon jumping, and then located <b>Transient/Biggs killer whales, the T02Cs</b>!! A very special family group of <b>5 whales</b> (mom and her 4 offspring) - with a 13 year old male who has scoliosis, and a calf (T02C4) born in 2017. We had some great views of these whales as they headed towards Discovery Island (BC). The fog had lifted, some smoky haze remained but visibility at the water level was good. A few harbor porpoise and bald eagles were encountered on the return trip to port, a big thanks Capt. Eric for finding those special T's. <b>Family grouping - Mom T2C born 1989, T2C1 born 2002, T2C2 born 2005, T2C3 born 2011, and T2C4 born 2017. T2C2 known as "Tumbo". He has scoliosis.

Trip Report: We headed out toward San Juan Island with reports of <b>J pod spread along the shore and out into Haro Strait</b>. After a stop at Colville Island to see the adorable harbor seals, we caught up with some males about a mile out from Eagle Point, and had a very nice visit with <b>L87 Onyx (born 1992) who swims with J pod</b>, and young male <b>J38 Cookie (born 2003)</b> whose dorsal fin has really grown! We then had <b>J27 Blackberry (born 1991)</b> cruising north and were able to see his lovely saddle patch. We also saw <b>J31 Tsuchi (born 1995) who is J27's sister</b>. There were other members of <b>J pod</b> further south but since the researchers and others working to help J50 were there, we left that group. There were a nice group of big Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks....always a treat to see those magnificent creatures! The water was calm, it was cool, all together a lovely day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

While the plight of the Southern Residents and the recent events continue to haunt us, it was a pleasure to see so many people enjoying the magnificent spectacle of some of our well-known transient orcas, the <b>T46s and T137s</b>, cruising north along the west side of Whidbey Island on August 12.

<br/>ID comment from Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "I received numerous reports last night and today from Ruston, Commencement Bay, and even Thea Foss Waterway. Some of the pictures were ID quality, and it is Stump. She likes to feed in the shallows, and is often very close to shore. She also spent years in San Francisco Bay, and doesn't seem to bothered by areas with high boat traffic."

Sat Aug 11 - This afternoon at <b>1407, J35 </b>vigorously chased a school of salmon with her pod-mates in<b> mid-Haro Strait in front of the Center for Whale Research</b> for a half mile - no longer carrying the deceased baby that she had carried for at least seventeen days and 1,000 miles. Her tour of grief is now over and her behavior is remarkably frisky. Telephoto digital images taken from shore show that this mother whale appears to be in good physical condition (no evidence of "peanut-head") following her record-setting ordeal. There had been reports from brief sightings by whale-watchers two days ago that <b>J35 (Tahlequah) was not pushing the calf carcass in Georgia Strait near Vancouver, BC; and, now we can confirm that she definitely has abandoned it</b>. The carcass has probably sunk to the bottom of these inland marine waters of the Salish Sea, and researchers may not get a chance to examine it for necropsy. -Center for Whale Research 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>J50/Scarlet and J35/Tahlequah Updates</b> 8/11: The team spent several hours with <b>J50 / Scarlet</b> on Saturday (8/11), watching her behavior and interaction <b>with members of J pod</b>. Researchers from University of Washington observed her swimming with the pod while trying to collect a fecal sample. Later the response team watched her fall as much as 1 kilometer (~1/2 mile) behind against a strong tidal current. Biologists were concerned that they did not see her eat, even in a prime foraging area off San Juan Island. A charter company reported seeing her catch a fish earlier in the day, and we are following up to find out more. Center for Whale Research confirmed <b>J35/Tahlequah is no longer carrying the calf</b> and appears to be in good condition. <b>J50 near Lime Kiln Point</b>, San Juan Island.-NOAA Fisheries West Coast

I was on San Juan Island on 8/11 at the <b>Land Bank pullout just a bit south of Lime Kiln. About 1:30 pm J pod came through</b>. They were quite spread out and took about an hour to move from south to north along the coast. I believe Mike was bringing up the rear with two females and J50.

Saturday Aug 11 trip report - on an overcast day, we headed out towards Colville Island to check on the many harbor seals hauled out on the rocks, then had a quick rendezvous with the Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, and continued towards S<b>almon Bank to view some of our Southern Resident orcas....J-pod</b> was reported in the area, very spread out, and slowly heading towards the San Juan Island shoreline. We had distant views of the J16s (including J50 Scarlet traveling with mom), and several other Jpod members, including <b>J39 Mako </b>who circled our boat - successfully fishing - good news!! A few bald eagles and glimpses of harbor porpoise rounded out the day - with some much needed rain! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist. <b>Part of the J16s - J16 Slick (est born in 1972), mom to J50 Scarlet (born 2014), and J26 Mike (born 1991).</b> -Photo by Jill Hein, Aug 11, 2018

Sat Aug 11 - <b>20:15-21:15 -</b> Saturday. We watched and listened to them from our beach as they <b>headed north in Eld Inlet</b>, along the eastern shore.

J50/ Scarlet Update: <b>J Pod moved into Canadian waters on Friday (8/10)</b>, and the international response team followed. The team spotted J50 / Scarlet and watched as she repeatedly dove and surfaced where the pod was feeding. Biologists could not tell whether she also fed, but they collected leftover scale samples that will help identify what kind of salmon the whales had eaten. J50 / Scarlet again appeared active and energetic. The team also sighted <b>J35 / Tahlequah</b>, but could not confirm if she was still carrying her calf due to poor visibility. We will provide updates as the team continues this unprecedented effort to learn from and support J50 / Scarlet and her family. <b>J50 / Scarlet swims near Point Roberts, WA</b> -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Thu Aug 9 - <b>22:30 NOAA Update: J50/Scarlet</b> Update (8/9): Progress! Response teams today reached <b>J Pod in Canadian waters and followed them into U.S. waters near San Juan Island</b>. While very skinny and small, <b>J50/Scarlet kept up well</b> with her mother and siblings. Veterinarian Marty Haulena from the Vancouver Aquarium got a thorough look at her and the team obtained a breath sample that will help assess any infection. They also administered a dose of antibiotics through a dart. Next step is to determine whether to proceed with trial feeding, depending on conditions and the location of the whales. Great work by the teams on the water! 
<br/><b>15:30 Update: J50/Scarlet</b> (8/9) Update: Teams have refined their stepwise treatment strategy and priorities and are ready if they encounter J50 / Scarlet. They laid out the steps this way:
<br/>&gt; Collect breath sample (via long pole)
<br/>&gt; Collect fecal sample (scooped from the water)
<br/>&gt; Other sampling of mucus and/or skin if practical (via long pole)
<br/>&gt; Simultaneously complete visual veterinary health assessment
<br/>&gt; Provide antibiotic treatment through pole system or dart
<br/>Once all of those are complete, then the teams will consider using live fish as a means to provide medical treatment to support her critical condition. If they decide to attempt that unprecedented step, they would first conduct a trial release of live fish to see if she will take the fish. The team would release fish from a vessel through a chute about 50 to 100 yards in front of J50/Scarlet. If she takes it, the team will discuss delivering oral medications inserted into the live fish based on the outcomes of the veterinary assessment. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

HUMPBACK WHALES - Thu 8/9 Trip Report: In bright, warm sunshine we left Cap Sante and headed northwest through beautiful Pole Pass, through the heart of the San Juan Islands. We found lovely<b> humpback BCZ0180 "Monarch" in President's Channel</b>, generally heading southwest. He/she did some very nice fluke up tail dives, giving us a good look at the beautiful pattern on the underside of the tail fluke, the identifying marks. We then headed to Flattop Island and saw a lot of adorable fat harbor seals, and and eagle family, with two mature mates, and at least one juvenile with a mottled brown and white feather pattern. Beautiful day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

NOAA Update: <b>J50/Scarlet</b> Update: Determined teams from Fisheries and Oceans Canada spotted Jpod again today (8/8), this time <b>in U.S. waters off the Olympic Peninsula northwest of Neah Bay, Wash</b>. They saw J50 with her mother, J16, also known as Slick. It was a bittersweet sighting for the teams to also see <b>J35, Tahlequah</b>, today, and witness the continued heartbreaking sight of her still carrying her dead calf, some two weeks since its birth. Our teams from NOAA Fisheries, DFO, and many other essential partners are ready to respond as soon as they are within range and conditions allow them to reach the pod and assess J50's condition. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast
