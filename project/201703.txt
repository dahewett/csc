Coastal killer whales - A week ago (03/30/2017) my girlfriend and I moved in as the managers of The Bullman Beach Resort. On our second morning here we sighted a pod of <b>at least five orcas about 200 yards off Bullman Beach</b>. One male/the rest were female/immature. The pod seemed to be slowly circling but generally maintaining a NW course. Perhaps feeding, circling, but nothing aggressive. At the same time, and maybe 100 yards south of the pod, we saw maybe two small whales - Minke's perhaps, though they stayed low in the water. -Scott Hartman
 
<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:27 a.m. - One gray whale spotted in Crescent Harbor</b> right now. They seem to be foraging. I think it's only one. In the 30 minutes I observed it, it was traveling further in towards the Navy Exchange seawall. Longest underwater period was about 2 minutes, shortest was about 20 seconds. I initially thought it was two, which is what I told Gretchen Shea. Very cool sighting, one of the coolest ways to call in late! -Scott Shea

After a lengthy search we caught up with most of <b>J pod (everyone minus the J17's and L87) near Point Lawrence on the east side of Orcas Island this afternoon</b>. They were foraging quite a bit doing lengthy dives and moving erratically in a foraging fashion. Typical March day where the weather changes every 5 minutes, but beautiful none the less. We don't really know what happened after we left. They were sloooooowly coming down past <b>Pea Pod rocks in Rosario</b>. That's the last we knew. I think we were the only ones out there in the afternoon. I think we left them around 2:30ish? -Traci Walter

<b>Saratoga Passage - North Puget Sound Gray Whale #49 "Patch"</b> was seen traveling northbound in Saratoga Passage this morning. From the bluffs <b>at Baby Island</b> we watched him steadily make his way northbound towards and eventually <b>across the entrance to Holmes Harbor to the Hidden Beach area</b>. He appeared to be keeping to that side so we drove over to Hidden Beach and found him around 2:30 p.m. northbound several hundred yards off shore. Within minutes he stalled and began rolling on his side to feed offshore just to the north off us. (pec and fluke fins above surface gliding through rough seas) He eventually moved closer to shore. We watched him for about 2 hours before we needed to leave and left him still feeding in the shallows nestled below the steep bluff. 
<br/>Another beautiful day with <b>a gray whale</b>. Here is video filmed from shore of North Puget Sound <b>gray whale #49 "Patch"</b> feeding in the shallows off Hidden Beach, Whidbey Island. So cool watching the relationship with seabirds who take advantage of the food he stirs up while feeding in the intertidal zone for ghost shrimp and other little creatures. Just one of those wonderful reminders we are all connected in some way! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network, March 26, 2017

It was a short trip from Langley Marina today to meet up with one of our all time favorite Saratoga gray whales, <b>Patch (#49) off Fox Spit, heading north</b>. Patch is sporting a few more clusters of orange whale lice on his massive flukes, which he displayed as he took some deep dives and kept everyone guessing as to where he might surface next. California sea-lions frolicking off Langley, some busy harbor porpoise and regal eagles were part of our wildlife trip, with a smattering of sunshine and blue sky breaking through to raise everyone's spirits after a damp start. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

South Puget Sound - I spotted the <b>Whale in front of Thompson Cove on Anderson Island at about 9AM Sunday morning</b>. I thought it was a log for several minutes because it was not moving  just bobbing in the small wind waves. It was not until it exhaled that I knew it was a whale... Pete Topping, WDFW

<b>11:45 a.m. - central Puget Sound -</b> "We just saw some vigorous tail slapping off Vashon Island. Not sure what type of whale." (Fauntleroy/ Vashon run)
When asked for more detail:  "I clearly saw the tail coming out of the water and slapping down again and again. From what I've seen on other occasions <b>I'd guess it was a humpback</b>. But I didn't think they were back yet. I saw it right when we were about to dock, a bit North of the dock, and quite a bit away from it." -Sandra Newby

I understand in addition to the <b>T46s, the T36s and T99s</b> were present. T36B1 gave me an ID challenge as her notch appears to be quite large compared to the slit it looks like in the ID guide.

Saratoga Passage - Approx. <b>4:00 pm we started seeing blows across Saratoga out from Cama Beach</b>. The gray steadily made it's way directionally towards Hidden Beach, (Greenback, Whidbey). We watched him continue towards Hidden Beach then make a turn <b>just after 5:00pm</b> where as he started heading towards southeasterly towards us on the bluffs just south of Baby Island. Around 5:50pm we went back over to the bluffs and could see the blows of now 2 grays heading right for us. They steadily made their way a few hundred yards apart from one another with <b>#49 reaching the shores below us first around 6:30</b>. We had about an hour of watching <b>#49 and #56 rolling around to feed</b> just under and a little to the south of us, making a lot of disturbance in the water as they rolled around digging up shrimp in the mud during high tide.

<b>7:20 p.m. -</b> Just prior to dusk I saw a large whale off <b>Arroyo Beach in West Seattle</b>. It was traveling north, fast. Close to shore, maybe 100-150 yards off shore. I could clearly see it surface and hear it exhale several times before it showed its fluke and then went under water and out of view. I don't know if it was a grey or humpback, it had a small dorsal fin. (The small dorsal fin along with the rest of the description sounds like a humpback.) -Jennifer Barwick

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:00 p.m. - </b>Hi Orca Network, Two friends and I were sailing through <b>Colvos passage</b> and encountered a whale coming into the pass around two pm. It surfaced right next to us, and we sailed behind it for a while as it headed south. We initially thought it was a gray, but then it began lob-tailing repeatedly in a few different spots which I have heard <b>is a common humpback behavior</b>. Now were confused. Unfortunately none of us got a great look at it's back; it surfaced too close it shocked all of us! Any thoughts? Thanks!
Additional: Thank you so much! <b>I thought I saw a dorsal fin</b> but was honestly too excited to say for sure. We first encountered the whale <b>between Ollala and Fragraria</b>. Our friends on another boat saw it from a distance at the south end of the pass, so it was definitely traveling south. Also I was thinking humpback because it came up and went down with a very curved motion -Kelly Greenwood

Coastal killer whales - March 21 - Brookings Harbor/Chetco River, Oregon: Orca Sighting: My partner Terry and I were treated to an observation of <b>multiple Killer Whales (6-8, including 1 or 2 adult males) in what appeared to be a feeding frenzy just off the beach at Brookings/Harbor at the mouth of the Chetco River about noon on 3-21-17</b>. We went back the next day and found that they had left the area. We sat in our truck and watched as this activity continued for about one hour. During this time we observed what appeared to be some kind of herding activity as the Orcas were in a circle about fifty yards across and at one point closing in on whatever prey they had targeted. There appeared to be a number of different sizes of Orca from very small to large with some dorsal fins as much as three to four feet out of the water with some white showing at the base of the fins. Due to rain there were few humans around to enjoy this awesome site.  They appeared to be feeding in groups of three or more working together. -James Cone

More from Toby: I can definitely confirm the <b>Humpback</b> Scott saw! We were working nearby:) at the time the very south end of possession bar and whale (and Scott) were west of us... We moved northeast of where Scott was to <b>east side of Possession</b> (20-30 minutes later) and then saw spouts in by shore several hundred yards <b>east of Cultus Bay</b> and between green can and shore.  I cannot confirm it was a grey but seemed too soon to be the same Humpback we had seen earlier.

Sighted<b> 5 Orcas at Cypress Head</b> - Today, March 19, at approximately<b> 1:00pm I sighted a pod of 5 Orcas, including one young Orca, but no Males, off Cypress Head</b> which is on the east side of Cypress Island. I was in my boat and I deployed my hydrophone so I was able to listen and observe the Orcas for almost 2 hours. Two noteworthy observations were: 1) They remained stationary at the surface in a tight group for several minutes prior to diving for an extended period of time; 2) One or more of the whales lifted the young Orca, which was belly up, almost completely out of the water.... I don't  think it was a newborn due to it's larger size and coordinated movements. I also believe that the Orcas were being playful when it was lifted. The action was so dramatic however that it caught the attention of crab fisherman that were picking up crab pots just south of Cypress Head. ... I had listened to the signature calls of the local pods during Scott Veirs "Friends of Skagit Beaches" lecture this past Friday, these whales sounded different.
Observed for nearly 2 hours, they appeared to be feeding at Cypress Head for an hour. In addition they played, spy hopped, and tail slapped while they appeared to be resting. There was an approximate -2.2 knot current at that time. I have frequently observed Harbor Porpoise in this same area however I did not observe any porpoise today. I  have multiple photos.

<b>Budd Inlet, South Puget Sound - Spotted a pod of Common dolphins</b> (after some investigating) in Budd Bay yesterday (17 Mar) about <b>10:30AM</b>. They were in mid-bay, headed south past the old DNR dock when we first sighted them and lost them when they were about even with the south end of Priest Point Park.  Looked to be around 6 individuals and they were actively broaching, both singly and in groups of two or three.  My view point is on the slope above Big Tykle Cove on the Cooper Point peninsula. -Tom Bigley

... The whales were traveling slowly and spread out in small groups with some singles <b>across San Juan Channel</b>. The first whales "Orcinus" encountered were the <b>J16s minus the J36s</b> and they were in a loose group about mid-channel. There were small groups and individuals both to north and the south of the J16s. The J16s briefly pointed southwest as the whales south of them converged a little. As the J16s moved slowly on, J27 and J31 (who were the southernmost whales) and another pair, <b>J40 and J45</b>, passed by on either side the boat. The J16s had actually dropped back some and, after another brief look at them, "Orcinus" moved on to a pair of whales several hundred yards to the northeast. This was <b>J39 and J46</b> and they may have been chasing a fish together as there were several tight turns and J46 did a bunch of tail lobs. These two moved toward and joined several other whales several hundred more yards to the northeast. The whales they joined were <b>L87, J35, J47, and J44</b> and this group seemed to be socializing.... See  full encounter summary report/photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 23

<b>The J16s and J19s - San Juan Channel.</b> Seemed like the first day of Spring and we sailed downwind wing on wing to Flattop Island only to hear <b>J pod showed up out of the blue into Friday Harbor</b>. We doubled back pronto and spent a glorious <b>afternoon</b> drifting back to Flattop with lazy cavorting whales. Vocalizations and echolocations on our hydrophone drew a picture of their world that we fell into. <b>J38 Cookie</b> was energetically chasing fish north of Jones Island. <b>L87 Onyx is still a part of the J pod family</b>. Spread wide across the San Juan Channel - who would choose Presidents, Spieden, or North? Who is making the decisions without J2 Granny?

Just this morning we were reminiscing about how two years ago today we saw <b>Humpback BCY0324 Big Mama </b>and lo and behold, we <b>found her up near East Point today</b>! One of our sharp-eyed passengers first spotted her and it wasn't long before we got some good looks at her and recognized that familiar fluke. It sure was wonderful seeing her! Big Mama was one of, if not THE, first humpback to return to the Salish Sea after whalers extirpated the species from our waters during the 1900s. <b>Since being first spotted she has brought back at least six calves, the most recent being last summer</b>. Perhaps next year when she returns she'll have another new baby with her!  We also saw tons of other wildlife, including harbor porpoises, harbor seals, Steller sea lions, and a peregrine falcon! It was a wildlife-packed day for sure! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy WW

<b>Unidentified whales - </b>We just received a whale report from Connie Barrett on Camano Island - at <b>6 pm they saw a large whale spout between Baby Island and Whidbey Island (No.Bluff/Greenbank area)</b>. (This is one of the North Puget "Sounders" shrimp beaches where the Gray whales are known to feed, so we expect it is one of our local Grays)

We were watching them from <b>2:58 to 3:38 pm</b> to be precise. They were super spread out in ones and small groups, and very shifty (except for Onyx). Framed by the Olympic Mountains, <b>Onyx (L87) cruises past us in Juan de Fuca Strait</b>. <b>Mako (J39), in front, and Se-Yi'-Chn (J45) travelling eastward. </b>We were joking they'd been taking transient lessons. We'd line up to be on their beam and then they would do a long dive and come up in a different direction. This happened repeatedly. <b>We saw L87, J38, J39, J47, J45, J35 and a few others I couldn't ID</b> because they were being so shifty. Their general direction was east at that point, but in a zigzaggy way. We heard J27 was further west and there were other individuals we saw off in the distance. I guess Maya had the J16s further to the east. It was a challenging day for getting ID shots. Seems to be the norm these days, sadly. I was just mentioning to passengers that the several times I've seen Js this winter I've never seen them grouped up. -Val Shore

What a day. Two trips on the Peregrine and <b>J Pod </b>both trips. <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca, south of Victoria</b>. They were heard on the hydrophones, but no one could find them.

The<b> 2nd "Sounder" is back</b>!! We started out with challenging conditions but it all improved - specially when whales were sighted! We were happy to again see #49 Patch, and the<b> 2nd of the "Sounders" to arrive - #56!</b> They were traveling together, first sighted south of Camano Head and we watched them as they traveled southbound along the <b>west side of Hat/Gedney Island</b>, close to shore. These whales arrive very hungry, having not eaten for 3-4 months. They'll stay in Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage for ~2 months, feasting on mud shrimp and ghost shrimp, before heading further north. A great start to our 2nd week back on the water. -Jill Hein - volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea (photos below)

... Since it looked like more whales were on the Canadian side, "Orcinus" worked its way west. <b>J35 and J47</b> were photographed together about mid-strait. To the northwest of them, <b>J41, J51, and J46</b> were together in a group. The J36s were to the west of this group and more single animals could be seen spread out to the west of Kelp Reef. The J41s and J46 headed southwest toward <b>Sea Bird Point and passed the Kelp Reef marker</b> by less than a hundred yards... -Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 22

Our excitement was through the roof today! We had our first trip of the year on the Western Prince II. It was a pretty chilly day but nice conditions on the water. Just before we boarded we got word that some orcas were sighted from shore. It turned out there were more and it was <b>J pod</b>! What an incredible treat to see these guys at this time of year. We were also lucky to see many Bald Eagles, Steller Sea lions, a host of different birds, and exotic hoofed animals on<b> Speiden Island</b>. -Traci Walter)

Anyone who knows me well knows I absolutely adore <b>L87 Onyx</b>.

Trip report: Snow was falling this morning when we got the first reports of whales in the area and by the time we left the dock the snow had stopped and patches of blue sky were visible. It was a welcome sight, though not nearly as welcome as what was to come--- we were soon on scene with <b>J-pod and L87</b>! It sure was nice to see those familiar dorsal fins again. The pod was spread out into several groups and were down on long dives but we were able to spend some time with several familiar friends, including <b>Oreo (J22) and her teenage son, Cookie (J38), Onyx (L87), and Blackberry (J27) with his siblings, Hy'shqa (J37) and her son T'ilem Inges (J49)</b>. We hope they're finding enough salmon to eat and while we wait for more encounters with them over the coming weeks and months we strive to make changes on our end to ensure these whales have enough food to eat in the future. -Sara Hysong- Shimazu, Naturalist, Maya's Legacy WW
<br/>Note: J37 lost both her mom J14 Samish and her great-grandmother J2 Granny within months of one another this past year, J49 his grandmother and great-great-grandmother. J49 is now 5 years-old and will travel by his mom's side the remainder of their lives. Oreo (J22), who lost her son J34 Doublestuf just over 2 months ago, northbound Haro Strait today with the rest of J pod (including her surviving son J38) and L87. It was so wonderful to be reunited with Jpod yesterday and even better finding that Onyx (L87) was still with them. This boy is such a survivor and I know many people have been thinking of him since the loss of Granny. Here he is with San Juan Island in the background.
