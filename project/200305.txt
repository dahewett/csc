Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called in a report of J pod off the west side of San Juan Island, from <b>7:30 am</b>, milling at South Beach, heading north until they passed the Lime Kiln Light House at about <b>11:30</b>, then they turned &amp; headed south at the county park. They were in a resting pattern from about <b>8:30 or 9</b>, until <b>noonish</b>, when they started milling around again near Hannah Heights. All pod members were present.
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported J pod in Boundary Pass, heading north at <b>4:45 pm</b>.

<b>May 30, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>Pseudo-Orca? Friday, May 30th we encountered an interesting, and unconfirmed cetacean sighting off the west side of San Juan Island. We were watching J-Pod in a resting pattern just north of Pile Pt. when a Canadian zodiac got on the radio &amp; said he saw a cetacean surface just ahead of the orcas close to the shore. A few of our guests saw the animal and the radio-talk leaned toward identifying the animal as a pseudo-orca. I was unable to see the animal myself, but there was definitely something there. If it was a Foster or another lone cetacean is unknown....did anyone else see this animal? If so, please add to this sightings report.
<br/>Emily E. Bremer, Naturalist
<br/>Island Adventures, Anacortes 
<br/>*<br/>
We left J Pod at <b>7 PM</b>, just south of the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, headed
south, with the winds increasing. They flip-flopped all day, between
Cattle Pass and Henry Island.

<br/>*<br/>
I left J Pod about 4 miles off of South Beach, south San Juan Island,
headed west, at <b>7:30 PM</b> this evening. This is a break in their pattern
of the last three weeks. I haven't seen them do this since last Sept.
Perhaps they are headed out west to meet the Ks and Ls. Hmmmmm.

J-Pod was nice-and-close at the south shore of Cypress Island. They used Bellingham Channel, headed south in Rosario and around Lopez Island. When we left scene the leaders were at Salmon Bank heading north up the shore and the trailers were back at Colville Island.

<br/><br/>
<b>May 23, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
...did anyone report seeing orcas off the East side of Sinclair Island last Friday (23rd) around <b>2pm</b>? I got a great picture of one spyhopping and there was one fiesty orca breaching a few times.
<br/>Marie
<b>6:00 PM</b> - Whales off South Beach, south side, San Juan Is., headed up the island.
In twenty four hours, J Pod has gone from False Bay, up past San Juan,
Stuart, S. Pender Islands, through Active Pass, down the Sts. of
Georgia, past Orcas, Blakeley, and Lopez Islands and back to False Bay!
Amazing!
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya

...in the middle of the Straight of Georgia, two Minke whales, very long 20' +, gray with a dorsal fin.
 The two, or perhaps one Minke whale was heading north.

A very relaxed visit with parts of J pod. J1 under the boat J2 rolling off the bow.
And the cookie bunch J22 et al. This was N. of Lime Kiln from <b>1500 on to 1600</b> but still S. of Kellet Bluff. Last I heard they were going N. slowly.

This morning at <b>11:00</b> a single gray whale came close to shore past 
Tulalip Shores. On the same course as we witnessed last night, the gray went 
right on past us on a dedicated course to Spee-be-dah, where finning and
feeding behaviors were displayed. Could it have been the same one as last 
night, back again to feast off Spee-be-dah? The whale left the feeding grounds 
about <b>12:30</b> and headed back south again, about a mile offshore.

<br/>*<br/>
The <b>6:30 a.m</b>. boat leaving Clinton was lucky enough to have one large gray
whale pass very close this morning on the N side of the boat just before we
left the dock. The whale was traveling east out of Saratoga Passage
surfacing many times along the way before making one deep dive with a great
tail fluke right next to the boat.

Neil of Captain Jack's Charters called to report J pod at Thatcher Pass this morning at <b>11 am</b>, southbound into Rosario Strait. Lots of activity and breaching going on.
<br/><br/>

J pod off west coast of San Juan Island between Pile Pt. and Edwards Pt. heading north this afternoon. Our naturalist identified J11 with J27, J31 and the baby J39; J16 with J33 and J26 who breached; J22 with baby J38; and J17; and J1 (Ruffles) came right up to and under our boat. What a thrill to see them.
<br/>Amy Massey and my mom, Gail.
<br/>*<br/>
Observed J-Pod from Salmon Bank to Pile Point, spread out and then coming together at about <b>13:00</b> hours with a few breaches and some upside down swimming splashing and tail lobbing. And a Minke whale off shore about a quarter mile away.

<br/>*<br/>
After flipping and flopping all day, J Pod was heading north at <b>5:00 PM</b>
past Henry Island.
In other news, a dead young Harbor Porpoise was spotted early this
afternoon off of False Bay (San juan island). We were able to retrieve it.
Ken Balcomb took it to the Friday Harbor Lab where necropsies are being
performed on several other porpoises. When and if I get any
results, I will let you all know what they are. Several dead porpoises
have been found since the recent sonar incident.

Tonight at <b>7:00</b> a single gray whale came close to shore past Tulalip 
shores. It was on a dedicated course to Spee-be-dah, where finning and 
feeding behaviors were displayed.

<br/>*<br/>
This morning we received a message about whales off Clinton (S. Whidbey Island) headed south toward Possession Pt. at <b>8 am</b>. The first part of the message was cut off, but I'm pretty sure the caller was reporting a gray whale or whales.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Observed J-pod passing through Active Pass yesterday afternoon. They were still heading North when we left them. They were traveling very close together. It was my first observation of them transiting Active Pass. The Pass is quite narrow and the Canadian ferries run through there so I wonder if that is a common method for them to make sure everyone gets through. The whale watch boats were polite. Lots of private traffic. We observed M3 keeping an eye on proceedings but did not notice them approaching anyone while we were passing through. Little J-39 was very energetic and showed us a lot of (his/her) chin and belly...but not close enough or the right angle to make out the calf's gender. The whales did spread out a bit after they cleared the pass by about a quarter mile. They did a little "porpoising"  and a breach.

<br/>*<br/>
The Island Explorer went through Active Pass with J-Pod around <b>3:00 pm</b>. After heading through the pass the whales headed north towards the Fraser River. With the big ebb tide, we expect to see them on our-side-of-the-pond today. We will give you an update on what the day brings.
<br/>Emily E. Bremer, Naturalist
<br/>Island Adventures, Anacortes 
<br/>*<br/>
We left J Pod south of Pt. Roberts, heading south, at <b>8:15 PM</b>. I would
suspect that they will be on the sourh or west side of San Juan Island
in the morning. They had gone through Active Pass at about <b>3:30 PM</b> and usually head north to the Fraser River, but instead headed toward the Coal Docks and then headed south. We picked them up at <b>6:30</b> near Pt. Roberts.

Susan:  Given the recent concern about harbor porpoise, I thought I'd pass along the following. Two dozen harbor porpoise seen today by Anita Lopez (NOAA Corp officer from NMML) between Edmonds &amp; Kingston around <b>6:05am</b> this morning. Middle of shipping lanes. Are they typically found in this particular area?

<b>8:30 AM</b> - J Pod at Hanna Hts., west side of San Juan Is.

<br/>*<br/>
I talked to Candi Emmons this morning, &amp; J pod was heading north past the Center for Whale Research at <b>9:45 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
We saw two big blows and nice fluke display from the Mukilteo ferry at <b>1:05 pm</b>. Could have been one whale or two (Grays) south of the ferry, perhaps a quarter of a mile, within a mile of the Mukilteo side.

Enjoyed watching the J-pod <b>9-10:30 am</b>. There were about 11 orcas, including Ruffled fin male, females, youths and a baby. They were feeding northward past Limekiln Lighthouse on the W. Coast of San Juan Island. The whale research boat was there filming. The orcas moved northward in a tight group, turned offshore of Henry Island and then fed southward.  
As more spectator boats appeared [some, too close], the pod split into three smaller groups and several whales displayed the slapping actions of being bothered.
<br/>Thank you for your web site.
<br/>Barbara Davidson
<br/>*<br/> 
So sorry I did  not see this until today. I was so busy watching whales all day that I never turned on my computer Sunday. We saw two grays southwest of the mouth of Cultus Bay, remaining in the area between <b>11AM and 3PM</b>. They appeared to move eventually toward the northeast (toward Possession Point).  Then again, at <b>4:30</b> we noticed a gray in the same area. Whether it was one of the same coming back to feast on whatever was so tasty in the area, or a different whale foraging in the same area, we do not know. These grays were well offshore, but were still attracting the attention of local boaters. All seemed to keep a respectful distance.  
<br/>Deborah Houseworth, Clinton
<br/>*<br/>
J POD passed by Low Island/San Juan County Park from <b>6:45AM-7:30AM</b>, very slowly and very spread out. Then they turned around and headed back South towards False Bay.

<br/>*<br/>
At <b>2:00pm</b> a single gray was spotted between Tulalip Shores and 
south Camano Island. It lingered in the area for about 30 minutes and 
finally headed south. Then at <b>7:20pm</b>, two grays came by just offshore from Tulalip Shores. They were headed north into the waters off Spee-bi-dah, 
where they finned and fed along the shore.

<b>5:11 PM</b> - Orcas, J Pod, all day, back and forth between Lime Liln Park and Cattle Pass. Right now there are at the Light House at Lime Kiln.

Just got a quick instant message from a friend of mine in Coupeville of 4 gray whales heading out of Penn Cove (Whidbey Island) around <b>6:50pm</b> tonight.  She isn't positive but said it looked like one on them was a baby.
<br/>Sonja Smythe 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:00 PM</b> - We left J Pod between Lummi Is. and Orcas Is., heading south down Rosario St.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We'd like folks along Saratoga Passage to be on the lookout for a gray whale wrapped in a crab line &amp; trailing an orange buoy (it appears no crab pot is attached, &amp; the whale seems to be swimming normally). Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called to report this whale at <b>5 pm</b>, swimming between Camano Head (S. Camano Island) &amp; Hat Island, heading NW up into Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Bennett also reported J pod off Lummi Rocks, headed south at <b>1330</b> today, and a pair of grays this morning off Langley.

<b>12:15pm</b>, two grays came north into Port Susan, close in by the bouys here at Tulalip Shores. They headed for Spee-bi-dah, one of their favorite feeding spots in this area, but didn't stay and feed there. At -3 tide about then, alot of whale bites where evident in the sand. The two grays headed back south, swimming very much in tandem at a slow but deliberate pace.

Spent time with J pod today. Caught up with them about <b>1345</b> on the north end of San Juan Island. J-1 was with a small group there. Further down we had J-8 and her entire family. J-11's new calf looked pink and very energetic. 
The J's were split up into three groups that were back and forth along the west side when we were with them. They spent a lot of time traveling or hunting underwater, could have been either. We observed a few animals doing the backstroke at the surface and J-1 did sort of a half breach at one point. Around <b>1530</b> the most southern group turned back (they were just south of Lime Kiln) and headed NO. (J-17 and J-22).  
<br/>We also had a large Minke feeding off of Burrow's Island on the way home. Observed a few harbor porpoises SO end of Lopez Island.

Cher Renke reports an orca Mom &amp; calf off American Camp (SW San Juan Island) heading north at <b>8:15 am</b>, porpoising at a fast rate of travel, with no other whales around that she could see. Mom did a breach. At <b>8:20</b> they had reached Eagle Cove. She saw Mom orca breach 4 or 5 times.
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research reported orcas heading north past the Center between <b>10 &amp; 10:30 am</b>, very spread out, so it is likely the Mom &amp; calf were just trailing behind the others.

They varied between shallow dives and some longer dives. They continued this way until a motorboat sped by very very close. I feel certain the boat was not at all aware of the whales' presence.

<i>J pod</i> came around the south end of Lopez to Salmon Bank during mid-morning through mid-day while a large group of <i>Offshores</i> was apparently up in the Gulf Islands or Boundary Pass. Late in the day J pod continued north along the shore of San Juan Island and Henry Island as the Offshores headed south in Haro Strait spread out in subgroups mostly on the western side. The closest point of approach was around <b>1730</b>? When J pod was in a tight resting group near Kellet Bluff, while the Offshores were in many groups spread out from mid Haro Strait to D'Arcy Island. The offshores were vocalizing, so J pod must have heard them. This is another example of these different types of killer whales not intermingling when there was opportunity. Very interesting, and quite different from what we would expect had K or L pod come that close to J pod party time! We last saw the Offshores heading toward Oak Bay around 2030, still vocalizing. Best Wishes, 
<br/>Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research

<br/>*<br/>
Ken, Dave, and Candy (Center for Whale Research) are way too busy in the basement with photos of Offshores to be reporting for awhile but Ken said he recognized at least eight to ten from this pod last year. Judging from the numbers I would say they are all the same Orcas assuming they stay in the group like residents and I see no reason to think otherwise. This would be their fourth or fifth trip inland in the last about 18 months. Ken and I left the Offshores about <b>5:00</b> and headed in. We were probably three miles off Kellet Bluff when we left them. We ran into J Pod at Kellet Bluff. They were grouped tight together and moving north. All were there and looking good, acted just like normal. As we were watching them I looked across and could see Dave and Candy in Orca (small boat) about two miles off and assume they were with the Offshores as they wanted a few last minute shots. I think Dave said he had about 364 [digital photographs] which isn't near enough. With Candys 400 or so and Kens 350 you know why we won't hear from them for awhile. 
Anyway, I think we can start assuming these guys definitely don't intermingle. I saw no signs of J Pod even being excited. I'm sure this isn't their first encounter. For us, a lot of excitement. For J2, Granny, at 90+ just another day on the block.

Between about <b>8:00am and 10:00am</b> on the North tip of Harstine Island in the South Sound, looking west onto Pickering Passage, the Orcas had reached the North tip of the island, had rounded the island, and were heading south in Case Inlet. They lost sight of them as they neared Heron Island. They were first seen about 1 mile north of the Harstine Island Bridge, swimming north in Pickering Passage (between the island and the mainland to the west). They must have then rounded the north tip of the island as they were next reportedly seen swimming south in Case Inlet, which is the water to the east of Harstine Island. From the people I have spoken to, they were last seen swimming toward Heron Island, a small island just off of Harstine Island. Guess that they were just on a little jaunt around Harstine Island.

From the reports, it appears that there were at least 4 Orcas (seen at once) and maybe up to six. One woman was quite sure that there may have been a baby or juvenile with the pod from the size comparison when it surfaced along side a larger (or so it appeared to her) one.
