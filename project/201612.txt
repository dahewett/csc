Center for Whale Research Encounter 127 with the <b>T86As and T124As in Haro Strait</b>: "The photos were good enough to determine that there were actually <b>two new calves and that both T124A and T124A2 appear to be the mothers</b>.

My birthday twin bro Howard Garrett met up with me at B<b>aby Island area, we patiently waited, and FINALLY saw a blow</b> could see they were heading southeast. We both headed off to <b>Fox Spit</b> and this is where we saw the best of them, <b>with K26</b> cruising southbound with his family nearby in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, totally awesome! Orcas continued southeast towards <b>Langley</b> and met up with others there to watch them <b>until around 3:30</b>. It looked like they were heading back north again? that would be kewl. It surely was a great day! Love belated birthday presents blessed, so blessed! -Marilyn Armbruster

End of year greetings to you guys, what a way to end it with <b>Kpod</b> out there today....Not sure how many whales I saw, but could ID (after briefly looking at photos) the following: Members of the . <b>K12s, K13s and K14s, K13, 25, 26, 21, 44, 22 (I think), 27, 34 and 43</b>.  They were having 3-4 minute down times, and then ALL surfacing at the same time, heart-stopping - so beautiful to see!!  A bit choppy out there, not getting good saddle patches. Hopefully others did as it sounds like the water was much calmer near Langley. -Jill (and Clarence)
<br/>(<i>ID notes by Sara Hysong-Shimazu: the lighting doesn't make it easy on any of these but. looks like the two whales on the left is K22 and K33. Maybe K38 in the background.</i>)

Southbound spy-hopping <b>member of K pod heading towards Langley, Whidbey Island, as seen from Hidden Beach</b>, followed by an apparent consensus by the 7-8 orcas to turn around and head north again from Langley mid-afternoon. Their welcome arrival was an uplifting sight for visitors and regular whale-watchers alike, drawing 2016 and the losses to the Southern Resident community to a close with a message of hope. -Sandra Pollard.

It was a wind chill kind of day, but after searching for 45 minutes from near Baby Island on Whidbey with a 180 degree view from Mabana Beach to Greenbank, K pod orcas finally began to show up. They were scattered far and wide, mostly one at a time, diving 5-10 minutes and very hard to predict where they would surface.

On the morning of 12/21/16, Dave Ellifrit was notified by Jane Cogan that there were J pod calls audible on the hydrophones. Dave called Melisa Pinnow and they both left Snug Harbor at 10:46 aboard Orcinus. At 11:03, Dave and Melisa arrived on scene with J36, J39, and J52 off of Bellevue Point traveling in a loose group south down Haro Strait. The three whales paused to forage for a few minutes and J39 breached once before splitting off from J36 and J52 and moving offshore. J26 was a little further south and inshore of the other three, also traveling south...See photos and full summary report at CWR Encounter 124. -Center for Whale Research

<b>2:30 PM - I found J Pod and L87 Onyx in San Juan Channel going East</b>. Pretty sure I saw J2, but the weather deteriorated quickly after I found them in-between the Cactus Islands, which concerned me, maybe they were taking a break from the 3'-4' waves... In 16 years I have never seen them in there, hope all is well with them. -Hobbes Buchanan

At <b>noon</b>, watching through our "Big Eyes" (thanks to the Center for Whale Research!), I can see <b>spouts from beyond Point no Point to the south</b>, all the way up to just south of Pt. Wells, Edmonds (which is as far north as we can see). It appears to me the spouts seem to be moving north, but at this distance it is difficult to tell for sure. -Susan Berta, Orca Network 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
I left<b> Point No Point at 11:50 am</b>, after seeing 3 males traveling fast <b>southbound from Whidbey/Doublebluff towards Edmonds</b>. They crossed over from Mutiny Bay towards Point No Point, came 200 yards from shore traveling southbound, then crossed back over mid channel in front of Eglon and headed on over to Edmonds. Zigzaggy southbound boys! Approx <b>11:20-11:45 a.m. - I saw one circle back but then cruise south again at a pretty good clip, out in front of Point No Point</b>. J27 Blackberry just offshore while passing Point No Point, Kitsap southbound. Mount Baker, Puget Sound and L87 Onyx rounding Point No Point, Kitsap southbound close inshore. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
  
<b>9:28 a.m. - Unidentified killer whale</b> - Just saw what I believe is an Orca carrying a seal. Live on <b>Mutiny Bay</b>. Orca heading north toward Admiralty inlet. Just moved here so not sure. Black fin had notches in it. The Seals tail was in the air. Dorsal fin was visible on Orca and every once in awhile Seals head would appear. Wish I had taken a photo but ran out with only binoculars. (<i>This report of an orca with a seal is at the same time residents were in the general area. Leaving open the possibility a single (or pod of) Bigg's may have been ahead of them or possibly Sea Lion thermoregulating - ALB</i>) -Nancy M Hnat

... arrived on scene, offshore of the <b>San Juan County Park at 14:50</b>. While the leaders were long gone, the trailers were spread out, slow traveling west-southwest. While Giles drove, Jim first photographed <b>J34</b>, followed by photos of <b>J47 and J44</b> engaged in social behavior including rolling over on each other. The next whale photographed was <b>J45</b>, youngest calf of deceased J14, who was observed swimming nearest to J34. J22 was first photographed alone heading south but within a few minutes she was joined by her son <b>J34</b> and both whale changed direction, as did the other three young males, and headed west southwest toward Discovery Island.... See photos and full summary report at CWR Encounter 123. -Center for Whale Research 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:45 p.m. - Saw for sure J16s, 14s, 17s, and 19s</b> but quite a few more way off- one nice pass! 
<br/><b>2:42 p.m. -  We're at Lime Kiln and see them, Js.</b> Leaders past Lime Kiln very spread. Some porpoising, moving quick with the ebb. -Monika Wieland Shields 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Unidentified whales - Saw <b>one blow from Whidbey Island near Lagoon Point</b>, but haven't seen anything since. That was about 30-45 minutes ago (<b>3:10ish</b>). -Margaret Marshall 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:00 pm - Just saw a brief glimpse of a tail on the Edmonds-Kingston ferry</b>. Closer to Kingston side, my guess is a humpback. -Madelyn Gilbert Aman

<b>J27 and other J pod members</b> tucked in close to one another for at least this part of their northbound travels up<b> Admiralty Inlet</b>. -James Gresham

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:29 p.m. - They are much closer to Marrowstone than Whidbey </b>at this point, especially the leaders.
<br/><b>3:45 p.m. - Visible from the south side of Lagoon Point</b>, Whidbey Island. Mid-channel south of Marrowstone Island. From my perspective on Whidbey, they are mid channel just a bit toward the Whidbey side from the mile market buoy, between the buoy and the southern end of marrowstone. Closer too marrowstone. -Margaret Marshall

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Great afternoon with part of <b>J Pod, J16 Slick and her daughter J50 Scarlet</b>...The orca's passed Bush Point from around 3-4 pm with 3 of them close in. Most were mid channel and further over at Marrowstone Island side. -Marilyn Armbruster, December 3, 2016 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

After one of those slightly surreal treks along Whidbey's back roads only to find the Southern Residents were always just out of sight around the bluff, we eventually caught up with the <b>leaders in Mutiny Bay</b>. At least five whales were together at one time, milling and tail-slapping, and not in any particular hurry. It seemed an interminable wait at <b>Bush Point</b> before the whales (came by, but our patience and that of fellow frozen Orca Dorks (Marilyn Armbruster and Jill Hein) was amply rewarded with <b>three of the J16's</b> passing close to shore. As the light faded the orcas were still heading in a northerly direction. -Sandra Pollard

<b>3:14 p.m. - Pod of 4-5 off old Beach Road, Mutiny Bay</b>. -Nancy M Hnat

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:15 p.m. - mid-channel, about 1 mile so. of Bush Pt/Whidbey side</b>, approaching Foulweather Bluff/entrance to Hood Canal/Kitsap side (sightline), closer to Whidbey. Lots of tail lobbing, splashing and feeding behavior but still heading north at a fairly steady pace. This is Susan posting, have to go work at the Langley Whale Center soon, but what a blessing to see them in front of our ON headquarters! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:04 p.m. - North bound</b> still. Closer to the Kitsap side. <b>South of Bush Point</b>.

We spent time with J<b> Pod group B (J11's, 17's and 22') and L87 Onyx in Admiralty Inlet</b> today. Several of the whales made a bee line right to the boat as soon as we got on scene. We spent much of the encounter today drifting with engines off. It was great seeing them but also sad with the glaring absence of recently deceased J28 and J54. Seeing <b>J46 Star</b>, J28's oldest calf swimming with her aunt<b> J35 Tahlequah</b> was both heart warming and heart breaking. I hope Star is ok. The whales were foraging very actively and there seemed to be plenty of salmon around which is a good thing.
<br/><b>12:55 p.m. - The outside group are the J16's. J22's and at least J27</b> inside. Need confirm the rest. (Currently) Just below Point No Point. 
<br/><b>12:46 p.m. - Confirm 2 groups.</b> We"re moving to the western group. -James Gresham

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:45 p.m. -</b> They are definitely heading north now.
<br/><b>12:35 p.m. - </b>I was watching another smaller group north of that. I haven't seen the more north group in a while. Maybe they turned south a met up. -Danielle Pennington

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:44 p.m. -  </b>Marilyn called again with update: orcas were going north, around the point not too far out and also across the water over toward <b>Useless Bay</b>.
<br/><b>12:30 p.m. -</b> Marilyn DeRoy called from <b>Point no Point</b> to report seeing 7 - 8 orcas, perhaps starting to head back south.
<br/><b>12:36 p.m. -</b> Looks to be heading towards us at <b>Point No Point</b>. -Elyse Solitto

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:28 p.m. - </b>From high bluff Stamm overlook in Edmonds I could see beautiful line of <b>at least 8-10 dorsals all southbound east of Point No Point</b>. Pod is on Kitsap side of mid channel.
<br/><b>12:15 p.m. - there may be 2 groups</b> (or just different angles). And/ or I'm Seeing a baleen whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>12:27 p.m. - Mid channel closer to Point No Point. Southbound now. J's</b>. -James Greshamn

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:14 a.m. - I am at Point no point</b> and finally found them. They are south of Whidbey and seem to be slowly circling as first they were headed south and not north. Large male is still headed south. -MIchelle Goll

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:10 p.m. -</b> I am seeing blows <b>mid Sound </b>well east of where you (Danielle Pennington) dropped pin on map photo. -Alisa lemire Brooks

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:11 p.m. - They are passing Point No Point</b>. There is a large yellow channel marker. They are northwest of it. ...'m seeing a very large male up here north of the buoy. Must be spread out.
<br/><b>1:53 a.m. - </b>This is where I am seeing them. (map indicates <b>1 mile southeast of Point No Point</b>) ...Very close to the Kitsap side.
<br/><b>10:50 a.m. -</b> I see them from <b>Maxwelton beach</b> (Whidbey) heading north. They are way on the other side. -Danielle Pennington

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:52 a.m. - </b>Vessel Spokane reports <b>12 or more Orca whales</b> sighted. Full grown and babies. Heading <b>Northbound to Kingston</b>. -Donna Wharton, WS Ferries

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:30 a.m. - Saw 2 humpbacks off the coast of Victoria</b>, there might be one or two others as I saw what agitated to be several spouts in the distance but can't be sure. They were foraging in one area for awhile, then a tanker started up and moved their way and they moved out of there quickly. -Mariann Carrasco

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Gray whale 723, Saturday in Admiralty Inlet west of Point No Point</b>. We were headed back to Seattle after visiting with members of J Pod when a baleen whale was spotted in the distance. It turned out to be 723 known as Lucy or Lucy-fer. 723 is a member of the Saratoga Passage gray whales, a group of about a dozen who for many years have stopped by Puget Sound in the spring for a couple months of feeding in the waters of Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound while on their northward migration. For whatever reason it appears that 723 decided to stick around this year as he has occasionally been sighted all through this past summer and fall. Here he is surprising us by surfacing right at the bow of Island Explorer 3. -James Gresham, December 3, 2016
