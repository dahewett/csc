<b>8:20pm to 8:30pm - From Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> we got quite a treat. At first two orcas were transiting toward the south many many yards out in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Then coincident with a whale watching boat passing buy, more orcas appeared right in front of the lighthouse. We were treated with about seven orcas passing by toward the south. These ~ 7 orcas were only a "stone's throw" from the shore as they passed by! It looked like at least 2 males with their tall dorsal fins. -Greg Salo

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J51</b> popped up right in frame. I would not have gotten this shot if he hadn't seemed to know exactly where to be. One of those lucky, lucky shots. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Our evening trip was very peaceful. We spent the majority of it shut down, drifting, and listening to the orcas. We were watching a small bunch of the <b>J17 matriline</b>. I kept joking, saying, "Come on Notch (the five year old orca here), come say hi to me, it's my birthday after all". And he would do another long dive, foraging and pop up somewhere nowhere near where I expected...This went on for about an hour until finally, he did just what I was hoping he'd do. He went out of his way to come up to us and make the connection. He came up on the stern of the boat while we were shut down (where I watched from the roof), and swarm around, rolling on his side to look up at me. I've never had this connection from <b>J47 Notch</b> before. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:20 pm - </b>People are reporting some <b>clicks and calls on the LK hyrdo</b> too - my neighbor said some got just up to the lighthouse and flipped. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Great evening spent on <b>Hein Bank with Js and Ks (L87 too!</b>)  L87 surfacing with Mt. Baker in the background. -Sara McCullagh

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Watched <b>orcas pass Land Bank </b>heading south about <b>1:30 </b>now watching them off <b>Hannah Heights</b> where they seem to be milling and foraging at <b>2:15 pm</b>. Watched WDFW stop a large yacht that got too close - Soundwatch and the Center for Whale Research are out today too. -Susan B, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:52 pm - </b>I'm seeing them again on the web cam very close to shore - lucky onlookers! -Shelby Hight Fifield

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We headed out of town with reports of <b>Southern Resident killer whales heading south along the west side of San Juan Island</b>, and were fortunate to find many <b>members of both J and K pods</b> hugging the shoreline, hopefully finding lots of salmon to eat. We recognized<b> K-25 Scoter</b> and other members of the <b>K13s</b>, and then found <b>J-27 Blackberry</b> slightly offshore - he gave us some wonderful views as he foraged (and caught) salmon. Homeward bound we found harbor seals hauled out (some with new pups), and harbor porpoise. A beautiful day again - what an amazing summer we're having!!  -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 am -</b> We met up with <b>Js and most of Ks (didn't see the K16s or K21)</b> near <b>False Bay</b> on the am trip. Everyone kind of moseyed in from the north and south and all grouped up right before we left. I think I got at least 17 dorsals in one shot which is a new record for me. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 am - we left Js and Ks northbound Kellet Bluff</b>. The old girl's still got it - a big breach by <b>J2 Granny </b>this morning off <b>Henry Island</b>. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>6:00-7:00 pm - </b>Lots of happy whales. <b>6:00pm</b> traveling, fishing, breaching, goofing around.  Moving from <b>False Bay to Eagle Poin</b>t.  Can count about 15 but rougher water makes it hard to see them all.  Group of about 8 were in close to shore and continued past Eagle Point - at least two large males along with little ones and females.   About<b> 6-10 orcas</b> are out further and are still hanging around at <b>7:00 PM</b>.  -Jenny Stands Wilson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:59 pm - Calls</b> can be heard on the<b> Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. Most are faint intermittent vocalizations. -Brendon Bissonnette

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:10 pm - </b>Hello! My daughters and I visited <b>Lime Kiln</b> and a large group orcas passed by. They were moving quickly and were spread out. It was our first experience seeing <b>orcas</b> and it was incredible. We were able to get only one decent picture and was hoping you could confirm the identity. We downloaded the ID survey and believe this is <b>Kasatka L82</b>. (confirmed) -Christina Massimino
<br/>(<i>ID confirmation by Melisa Pinnow, naturalist and Center for Whale Research volunteer</i>)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J, K, and L pod (minus the L12s and L54s) came back down from the North</b>. Out on the Odyssey of San Juan Excursions, we caught up with the orcas as they headed <b>towards San Juan Island from Stuart Island</b>. They were all very spread out. We saw the <b>K13s first and Skagit K13</b> caught a salmon right off our bow! She could have called to her adult son, <b>Scoter K25</b>, who was nearby because he then rushed over to her and they both dove. I am inclined to think that they shared the salmon underwater. I think <b>Comet K38 (Skagit K13's grandson)</b> also caught a salmon a few minutes later. He then played with some kelp afterwords. Next, we saw the J19s and the <b>K14s</b> (and may more orcas in the distance) who were inshore of us, and then the <b>K16s</b>, including <b>Cappuccino K21</b>, passed by.

Another epic day on the water! We've had wonderful encounters with members of<b> J, K, and L pods</b> the past few days. They have been spending much of their time swimming together in massive social groups and today was no different. We had huge groups of whales swimming tightly together <b>in the Strait Georgia</b> spending much of their time socializing. As they neared East Point on Saturna Island, the whales spread out all the way across the strait in such a way that we couldn't have gone back to the dock if we wanted to. They were everywhere in a proverbial <b>whale soup </b>breaching, spyhopping, and cartwheeling in every direction we looked! What a happy problem to have! -Katie Jones

Good evening! We had a nice little visit with the <b>T60s right outside Friday Harbor this evening</b>. I love it when whales show up on our back doorstep. What a treat! This is the first transient orca encounter we've had in ages and apparently they were traveling up San Juan Channel nailing everything they could catch this afternoon. We should start to see more transient orcas as we get closer to autumn. All those baby seals are being weaned from their mothers and some of them become important food for the orcas. I know it's hard to think about the whales munching on those cute little seals, but everyone has to eat. It's the raw power of nature and it keeps our planet in balance. -Katie Jones

(July 17th) We watched <b>L87 </b>Onyx travel south, and when the rest of this companions turned around and headed north, he missed the switch...The <b>J2's, J19's, and K14's headed all the way north, through Active Pass</b>, and <b>L87 Onyx was left by himself off the west side of San Juan Islan</b>d. Since I've been watching these whales for the last three years, I've never seen him alone like that. At sunset he was seen traveling up the west side alone, and on the hydrophones you could hear his calls. Orcas have specific dialects, and vocalistic traditions unique to their pod and matriline. He called out off the west side of San Juan Island into the early morning. <b>J2</b> Granny had lead her pod all the way back down south of the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> by the morning (the 18th). Then she turned around and porpoised north at a fast pace. <b>Finally L87 Onyx was spotted heading to San Juan Island</b> from the west with a small group of K Pod whales. J2 Granny had also turned back around and was heading south. Orcas can hear extremely well, and probably heard one another once they entered into the same acoustical corridor. J2 Granny was there to meet L87 Onyx... We saw the <b>J2's, J16's, J19's, J22's, K13's</b>, and <b>K14's</b> today. Found the J16's and J22's foraging right outside of our harbor around <b>7:30 </b>right before we headed in for the night. -Heather MacIntyre

Today, we first came across a <b>pair of synchronized minkes</b> not far from the south end of San Juan Island (SJI). We continued north following the <b>K13s</b> heading north along the west side of <b>SJI</b>. Near Hannah Heights, they suddenly turned south swimming hard against the current. There were several breaches from <b>K44</b> Ripple as he swam alongside his mom <b>K27 </b>Deadhead. Then, K20 Spock followed by son K38 Comet turned and made a close pass by the boat. As we were getting ready to head home, <b>L87</b> Onyx suddenly appeared not far from the boat quickly moving south. It was a lovely afternoon spent with whale friends followed by a stunning sunset... -Rachel Haight

He, <b>L87</b>, was with <b>Granny</b> headed north (in <b>Haro Strait</b>). They came up on<b> J19s + K26 </b>+ others headed south in resting mode.

We traveled via Thatcher Pass, through the islands, and thanks to first mate Eric's "eagle eyes", found <b>a humpback whale fairly close to the Lopez ferry dock</b>! We were the first on scene and enjoyed watching him foraging for quite some time before other boats arrived. We then headed out towards Salmon Bank and found<b> "Nick Jagger", the Minke</b> whale who is easy to identify!! We also had the opportunity to see harbor seal pups at one of the popular haul-out areas, bald eagles, and a few harbor porpoise. Although the orcas were "far" up north today, we still had a great day viewing our local marine mammals! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

The Resident orcas sure have been going the distance lately...members of<b> J and K Pod</b> went north again, through <b>Active Pass</b>. Active Pass has got to me one of my most favorite spots to watch orcas. <b>L87</b> Onyx and <b>J2</b> Granny. I love the bond these two have. For those of you that don't know, J2 adopted L87 after he was orphaned, and after the members of K Pod that he traveled with died. L87 has seen a lot of loss in his short life, but hopefully with J2 by his side he feels a sense of security.  -Heather MacIntyre

We left at <b>9am</b> and were on scene with <b>orcas</b> by <b>9:45 west of Naval Air Station</b>, Whidbey Island (Rosario Strait). The orcas were very spread out (by the time we left for home, the orcas were separated by 18 miles), and the groups we caught up with were slowly meandering west. It was an incredibly relaxing trip where we were able to sit and let the orcas parade by. We also spotted a pair of tufted puffins and later found a bait ball with a harbor seal and spiny dogfish actively feeding. The last groups of whales to pass us were <b>J16 &amp; J50 followed by J36 &amp; J52</b>, a treat to see both babies! J52 was breaching, spyhopping, and porpoising as he passed by. Beautiful morning on the water. -Rachel Haight

Several large males, females and youngsters, all close together, very tactile behavior, rolling around, floating on their backs, tail slapping, pec slapping (looked like he was waving good morning) and several graceful spy hops. The littlest one did two partial breaches! So cute! They just swam around <b>Eagle Point slowly heading north</b> in a tight and playful family group! What a great way to start the day!

<b>Juan de Fuca Strait About Noon time</b>- Less than an hour out of Port Angeles we found at least <b>6 humpbacks including Split Fin (BCZ0298), Split Fluke (BCX1068), BCX1057, Heather (BCY0160) and her calf and possibly MM20004</b> (no photo's of this one.)

At about<b> 8:00 am</b> one of our passengers reported a whale behaving much like the <b>Humpback</b> we saw yesterday, east of the traffic lanes <b>near Meadow Point (Golden Gardens, north Seattle) </b>moving South. I didn't see it myself since they reported it 10 minutes after we had passed but it sounds like the same animal, with a hunched back. -Justine Buckmaster

We were headed out on our way down towards the <b>West side of San Juan Island</b> when we got a report of<b> a group of orca up towards Entrance Island</b>. We altered course to see if we could find them and were rewarded with a visit with<b> T125, T127</b> (not sure where T128 or T125A were), and the <b>T46Cs (T46C, T46C1, T46C2 and T46C3)</b>.

With overcast skies and hazy air, we headed to the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>, hearing that <b>J-pod</b> was in the area. But first checked out all the beautiful harbor seals, some with new pups on Colville Island. Continuing north, we found - not J-pod (who were further north) - but members of<b> K-pod AND L-pod</b>!! We spent time with the <b>K-12s and L-22 and her son L89</b>, what a treat! They traveled north, then south, between Hannah Heights and Cattle Point. So beautiful to see them in the mirror-like conditions of the Salish Sea - what an amazing day for us all, with lots of sea-birds, harbor porpoise, and bald eagles. -Jill Hein

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A trio of <b>three male orcas</b> gave us quite a unique and intimate show of behavior in the afternoonfrom the Island Explorer 3.  <b>L89, K33, and K37</b> followed each other around in circles, rolling around, splashing, lunging, and taillobbing.  The behavior kept going on for quite a while before K37 peeled off and the other two just continued with the play.  We could only take wild guesses at what it meant to all of them, but it sure looked like some big time bonding with the dudes! -Bart Rulon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K44 spyhop, and K13, this afternoon off of Point Roberts</b>. -Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We spent time with the <b>K13's</b> out in the middle of the <b>Strait of Georgia</b> as they headed towards East Point. This was my first opportunity this season to see this family. While the waves weren't very big, the current was fairly strong so we saw them splashing through the water. -Ashley Keegan
 	
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We spotted <b>a humpback whale in Puget Sound! </b>Just s<b>outh of Point Wells</b> moving south, keeping a low profile at<b> 8:35ish</b>. The poor guy is VERY hunched over, only showing his dorsal fin on deep dives. May have entangled flukes or spinal deformity. Will post photos soon...He's very hard to spot, only lifting himself just high enough to breathe and taking 3-4 minute dives between each dive sequence. -Justine Buckmaster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 am - </b>This is the<b> little Humpback Juvenile with the hunched backoff Point Wells</b>, Woodway. He was very shy and could only get the very top of his dorsal area. Came to surface a number of times but then rolled under the water only showing a small portion of his back. -Wayne McFarland

<b>Members of J, K, and L Pods</b> went back and forth off the <b>west side of San Juan Island all day</b>. I heard that the L22s were hanging out off False Bay (while the rest of the L12 sub-group had gone west). The others came down Haro in the morning, went north in the afternoon, and then came south again in the evening. I saw this third pass as they headed south past Lime Kiln around 6:30 PM. Not quite everyone was present - the J16s and perhaps a few more were continuing north, but the rest of J-Pod, most or all of K-Pod, and most or all of the Ls (minus the L22s) were there. There are <b>4 L-Pod whales (L72, L105, L90, and L92)</b> that usually travel with the Greater L4s that haven't been with them in inland waters so far this summer, but they were back with the pack. That means I got to see them for the first time this year! Distinct male L92 Crewser is shown here in the orange waters off Lime Kiln. The abundance of local wildfires has made for the surreal lighting these last couple of days. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K21 Cappuccino </b>surfacing just north of <b>Henry Island </b>this evening. No filter on this, it's all that hazy, smoky lighting. It was, despite the smokiness, really nice to see this big guy. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>6:34 pm - </b>intermittent echo <b>clicks and some squeaks on the hydrophones at Lime Kiln </b>right now...sound distant and getting closer... -Wayne McFarland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:38 pm - </b>I took a whale watching tour out of Friday Harbor on Monday. We saw <b>35-40 orcas</b>, and the guide said it was one of the best tours she'd ever done as far as the number of whales we saw. We were on the west side of San Juan Island, and went up past the Lime Kiln Lighthouse. -Barb White

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<b>12:06 pm - They are milling off American camp now.
<br/>11:00-11:28 am - Parade of whales by Lime Kiln</b>...Although we missed front of pod, we estimate <b>about 30 </b>just since we arrived. Appears last one passed by about 11:28. Whale soup at Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon. A whale photographer standing next to us said J, K and L were the groups we saw today. She said the babies in front of us were J50 and J52, J51 had gone by earlier. We watched from American camp until about 1:30. We thought pod had headed out but some turned and came back to the camp where they appeared to be milling and feeding. Saw some lunge behavior like they were chasing fish. They appeared to be slowly working their way north again maybe back to Lime Kiln. One whale further out in channel breached and lobbed so may times (more than 20), that I stopped counting. Numerous whale boats in area, so imagine pics will start streaming in. What a lucky, wonderful day! -Krista Paulino

Well it was a bumpy ride getting there yesterday but we had a WHOLE LOT OF RESIDENTS! <b>All of J's, All of K's and most of L's in Swanson Channel</b> heading into Active Pass. It's been so long since I've seen so many of them together....incredible day....even with a boat breakdown on my way home. -Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had some rather eerie lighting effects and cloud cover due to the wildfires as we neared Vancouver Island, B.C. With reports of L pod whales in the area, we were delighted to see <b>Crewser (L92) and Ballena (L90)</b> as these whales had not been seen in the San Juans this year. <b>Racer (L72) and Fluke (L105) </b>were also spotted and confirmed by the Center for Whale Research, which carries out an annual census of the endangered Southern Resident orcas. The whales were actively hunting for their favorite food, the Omega rich Chinook (King) salmon, with some fast porpoising and tail-slaps. -Sandra Pollard

Just checked in on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone at approximately 8:43pm</b>. Heard very faint <b>calls</b> that sounded like S1's... Likely J pod.

Sunset whales...The same whales that have been around for the past week or so (<b>J-pod, Group A and the K14s</b>) were off the west side and heading south in a hurry. On our way out we stopped for a quick but excellent look at a couple of minke whales that were foraging off of Salmon Bank. We continued north but we didn't have to go far before the evening light began illuminating the blows of our orca friends.  The first whales we saw were <b>Hy'shqa (J37)</b> and her young son, <b>T'ilem I'nges (J49)</b>. This young male was the last baby to be born and survive before we welcomed our four new babies. He'll be three years old this year! He's growing up so quickly. I've noticed it a little recently but tonight especially so that his dorsal is starting to look a lot like his mother's... -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
