A person who helped bring a stranded and deceased harbor porpoise to be examined by the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network mentioned that they had seen <b>a small group of orcas in Penn Cove</b> on Sunday.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around <b>2 pm - Port Madison Sighting. 4 orcas</b> entering Port Madison on the North end, traveling. - Jon Seibert

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just off <b>Kingston. This little orca</b> was providing a great show! - Michele Auseth.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Off Presidents Pt just south of Kingston</b>, at one point a seal was 50' off my stern. The orcas had gone under a hundred yards away off my bow. I looked back at the seal just in time to see a black and white torpedo take it down. Amazing sight! - Scott Orness

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

WOW! 2 minutes from Salty Towers dock and we find <b>a Grey Whale right in Sooke inner Harbour!</b> Rare to see. - Sooke Coastal Explorations

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:15 PM - Whale sighting just off Waterman Point in Sinclair Inlet. Three orcas</b> very active, breaching, and tail slapping. Watched them for close to an hour from dusk to dark. Could still hear them after we couldn't see them any more. Very rare in these parts so they say. - Lorrie Miller

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 - At least two orca</b> were playing in the wake of the Evergreen State ferry heading to <b>Vashon</b>. - Chris Ruffini

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:14 - </b>they just passed <b>Restoration Point on Bainbridge</b> heading south. I am heading to the next place to look. Closer to Kitsap as they went past the point, but east of the red buoy.
<br/><b>5:09 -</b> moved to <b>Rockaway Beach on Bainbridge</b>. They are slightly south of me near the yellow bouy. <b>At least 4</b>.
<br/><b>5:01 - </b>heading south. <b>South of Alki</b> lighthouse moving fast. - Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Ken Balcomb relayed reports of <b>a group of Transients in the Canadian Gulf Islands</b> this afternoon, heading down Trincomali Passage and through Active Pass into the Strait of Georgia.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hard to mistake <b>T065A's</b> dorsal. That's what it looked like from the photos I saw posted at least. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas seen from Fay Bainbridge Park</b> as they headed south past Bainbridge Island at <b>345pm</b> this afternoon. - Tim Cuddy.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:03 pm - 4 orca heading South from Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Island</b>. Looks like 2-3 adults and 2 juveniles. - Nicole Bav

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9 am - </b>Ken Balcomb reports possible Transients heading south from<b> Double Bluff, Whidbey Island</b>.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 30</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>10:30 AM -</b> Orca Sighting off <b>Port of Brookings, OR just off Chetco Point.</b> While out fishing off Port of Brookings <b>an Orca</b> surfaced about 10' off our boat. We were trolling for salmon (salmon derby) and out of nowhere he/she cruised by! Solid shiny dark steel gray/black, fin curved, estimate about 21' in length. Definitely <b>an Orca</b>; came up for breath while I assume was chasing salmon. Which by the way, salmon catch for the derby that day was WAY down this year. He/She swam out in the direction of where at least 50-75 boats were salmon fishing about 2.5 miles off shore Port of Brookings (section 17) and swimming out to sea slightly southward. We were about 2 miles off shore from Port of Brookings and north about .5 miles (Chetco Point)in 112' of water. This is second sighting w/in approx. a week. I phoned in 1st sighting. I assume feeding on Salmon or traveling. It was during the salmon derby and it (or they) swam out towards where all the boats were trolling for salmon. We were heading back in to Port but I saw it (or they) surface several times while swimming out towards the boats. I just don't know if it was the same one that surfaced by the boat or a different one each time. I never saw more than one surface at once though. - Jessica Wiltrout

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 PM - Saw about 4-5 transients in Welcome Pass off the Sunshine Coast, BC</b>, Canada. They were heading north along the coast. There was at least one large male and maybe an adolescent. They were breaching and also doing many tail flops!! - Laura Wenn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas at 10:48 am to 11:25 just off Lime Kiln</b>, west side of San Juan Island, coming from south, but turned back south. - Sherrie Stahl.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Ken Balcomb reports some <b>combination of J and K pods were off False Bay</b> this <b>afternoon</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:46 - 7 orca pod going south Trincomali Channel</b> near Active Pass. - Roland Flutet

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Quick but close encounter between <b>Saltspring Island and Prevost Island</b>. <b>The pod</b> headed straight towards us, and we just had time to turn the engine off that they were upon us - or rather, under us! Apparently <b>7 different orcas</b> in that pod heading north east and then turning south east in the <b>Trincomali channel</b>, most likely towards Active Pass (at that time, the tide was heading out to the Strait of Georgia, making it an easy crossing). - Ro Land

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A <b>humpback </b>popped up right in the middle of <b>a group of orcas </b>on Matt's <b>4:30 </b>trip! Very unusual behavior for the two species to be so close to one another, but we didn't mind! - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Ken Balcomb reports<b> two humpbacks off the south end of San Juan Island</b>, and<b> two humpbacks were also seen in Porlier Pass</b> in the Canadian Gulf Islands.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 29</font></b></center>
<br/><b></b>

We watched<b> J and K pod off San Juan</b> in spectacular conditions. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:20 pm - Orcas at South Beach</b> right now. - Vickie Doyle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:24 pm - </b>RL Sayers reports in posts by others <b>a single orca off Lime Kiln at 2:30 pm</b> heading south, and now near Whidbey Island.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had three trips with the <b>T137s and T37s</b> in some pretty choppy water! Whew ... here's to calm water! Transients aren't always flashy after they make a kill like most of my other pictures depict. Sometimes they just make a kill and keep going. Yesterday, we watched as three whales flew threw the air at the same time killing a harbor porpoise, then they seemed to eat on the go (prey sharing). These guys would make a kill then go back to business! - Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found the <b>T90's, T124's</b> as well as a third unknown group off <b>Saturna Island</b>. The whales' behaviour was pretty typical to start, then all of a sudden they picked up speed and starting pursuing a harbour seal! And they got it! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:06 AM - </b>Sighting on western side of<b> Admiralty Inlet</b>. OMG!! First sighting on this side of Sound near<b> Port Ludlow</b> (near Hood Canal). It is raining so I had been looking through telescope at rock outcropping to see how Birds Cormorants and Seals and Gulls were dealing with rain when right near outcropping an Orca was swimming .. was so excited I forgot to look for identifying clues!!! I eventually lost him as he headed South. Since the particular outcropping I was watching is where seals are daily sunning/sleeping, so assumed they were searching for food. - Kathleen Raffo

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:53 pm - Faint calls on Lime Kiln</b> behind motor noise right now. - Else Jean Jensen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:34 - Just headed south past San Juan County Park</b>. - Charky Ptera

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:25 am - Js and Ks vocalizing on both OrcaSound and Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>.
<br/><b>8:40am - K pod vocalizing on OrcaSound</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:49 am - K pod!</b> I wonder if this means the Campbell River J's and K's have returned. - Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:44 - Orcas on hydrophones</b>... - Vickie Doyle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Headed north around San Juan Island and met up with a beautiful <b>group of transient killer whales in the middle of the Haro Strait</b> right on the US/Canadian border.  Today we were fortunate enough to see the<b> T37s and the T137As</b>. - Emily, San Juan Outfitters

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

As they made their way through <b>Boundary Pass</b>, they saw a group of transients known as the <b>T137's </b>and they made their kill right beside the boat! - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Orcas!! <b>Bigg's transients again</b>: 5 minutes outside of<b> Snug Harbor! T137s and T37s</b> in challenging seas, racing! Ninth encounter: going for a tenth sighting, this time from shore! - Alisa Schulman-Janiger

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:00 am - </b>Whales in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>. My daughter was out in the dingy and says she saw at least 3 whales. Looks like a male and a female between <b>Fox Spit and Langley</b>. Looks like they are patrolling rather than transiting. - Jacques White

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30 this AM</b> on way to get gas!<b> Ts right outside of Snug Resort</b>, my dock! - Capt. Jim Maya.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30 PM -</b> We are volunteers for FOLKS doing our Thursday night<b> Lime Kiln State Park lighthouse </b>tour when we spotted <b>two Humpback Whales</b>, which traveled north not far from shore ... 5 to 10 minutes between dives ... both very close together. Saw tails on their dives. - Kelly Andrews

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

Orca Sunset! We watched members of <b>K Pod and L Pod </b>for over an hour this evening. They were widely scattered over several miles. We saw at least ten whales at <b>South Beach</b> within a half mile of shore, heading slowly down the coast; one huge male breached twice, and they milled for a while. We backtracked to Lands End and watched more whales heading down the coast; these were close enough to hear blows and a lobtail! We saw a few breaches after sunset. Great end to our day! - Alisa Schulman-Janiger

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw <b>a humpback and calf at Race Rocks</b> in intense fog, then the rest of J<b> pod came in with some Ks (K21, K16's) </b>later on. It was so nice to see the rest of J Pod again, and such a nice surprise. - Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Sightings off <b>Port Townsend. Same pod seen twice in day</b>, 6 hours apart, once from water and once from shore. 1 male, 2 females and one adolescent. <b>7 miles west of Point Wilson</b> at <b>14:00</b>. 200 yards off North Beach in Port Townsend at 20:10. At 14:00, small pod seemed to be traveling east towards opening of Puget Sound from the Strait. At 20:10, it seemed to be same small pod feeding/foraging along the shore of North Beach. A kite surfer in the area has an amazing story when pod surfaced 50 ft away. - Christina Cogan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We just received a call relaying a report of <b>an orca in Penn Cove </b>this evening at around <b>7:45 pm</b>, called in by Sammye Kempbell who got the report from their neighbor. They are in the Captain Whidbey end of the cove, and the orca was traveling toward Coupeville.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:17 am - </b>Sighting off <b>Hansville</b>. Orcas just sighted going east from Skunk Bay then east of Norwegian Point. - Leonard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:19 -</b> Victoria Clipper III just left them, 1 mi <b>NW of Lagoon Point.</b> They are northbound, looks like they are hunting along the tide rip. - Stephanie Raymond

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3 pm - T137's</b> approaching <b>Admiralty Head</b> southbound. - Michael P Colahan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Mom and calf Humpback Whale</b> today near Race Rocks! It was pretty intense watching them in fog that engulfed us all. You couldn't see much more than 200 yards away in any direction. Luckily, these two whales popped up after a long dive right next to Legacy. - Heather MacIntyre.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The<b> Pacific White Sided Dolphin </b>that has been hanging out in the south Puget Sound for a couple months was <b>in front of the Point Defiance Boathouse</b> for about half an hour this morning around 10a<b>m</b>. It did several jumps 8-10 feet in the air and was staying real close to the fishing boats. - Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Pacific White-Sided Dolphin </b>sighting! Took our little boat out around <b>8:15am</b> this morning and we were so fortunate to again see the dorsal fin of the white-sided dolphin thats been seen around here the past few days. He/she was about 15 yards in front of us and surfaced a few times before disappearing for the rest of our ride. Short as it was, always amazing! This was at the <b>south-east side of Maury/Vashon Island and Three Tree Point. </b>He\She was there in the same spot last Sunday afternoon, between Maury Island and Three Tree Point / Normandy Park. It was traveling - just saw the dorsal fin surface 2 or 3 times and then it was gone. - Jen LaGrutta

<br/><br/>

<br/>

Good morning! Here's another shot from yesterday's encounter with <b>Bigg's killer whales</b>. This is a behavior we call a cartwheel. Upon closer inspection of the photo, it makes me wonder if this orca wasn't trying to launch one of the little common murres sitting on the surface into air. You can see there are a few small birds in the image and one in particular behind the splash of the whale's flukes. Just missed! Sometimes young transient orcas will play with birds, perhaps to hone their huntings skills. - Katie Jones.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were out on a whale watch on Tuesday and spotted <b>8 to 12 Southern Residents off of Oyster Bay / Miracle Beach (north end of Georgia Strait</b>, about 15 miles south of Campbell River) on Vancouver Island, BC. I was just so excited to see Southern Residents up there. I do have photos of the saddle patches if you are interested. They were in the resting mode traveling south. After about 20 minutes, they were waking as I spotted barrel rolls, breaches, tail flops, spy hops and exposed bellies. It was amazing! - Jodi Mitchell-Ulriksen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6 pm - Southern residents off Campbell River</b>. - Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Oh, just more flying whales. Great morning with <b>Bigg's (transient) killer whales in President Channel</b>. - Katie Jones.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:55pm - Orcas spotted between Sucia and Orcas Island</b> right now. - Karlynn Elliott

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Heading <b>west from Victoria, we caught up with the T18's</b>, a charismatic group of 4 transient orca, easily recognizable because of <b>T19B</b>. He's about 19 years old, and hasn't quite grown into his fin, to the point where it leans dramatically over to one side. Meanwhile in Vancouver, they were looking at different transients! They found a huge group consisting of at least 20 whales. Likely the T36A's, T37A's, T65A's, plus another unidentified group. In the afternoon the T18's were too far west to check out, and the big group of transients split in to more normal sized groups and headed our way. We caught up with them in San Juan Channel. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Mark Kudraz called to report seeing <b>at least 8 orcas at 9 am from the Pigeon Point Lighthouse in south San Mateo county, California</b>. They were several miles offshore, headed slowly south. A few of them looked like subadult males.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 25</font></b></center>
<br/>

Today <b>in San Juan Channel right outside Friday Harbor</b>. We got to spend time with this <b>humpback whale</b>. Note the distinctive split fin. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A <b>pacific white sided dolphin</b> danced around the boat. Darn near got in the dingy!  Played with us for 1/2 hour :-) -  Tim Ferris.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">August 24</font></b></center>
<br/>

Whales in Active Pass 7:50 pm. - Gary Cullen.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Seven year old<b> Echo, J42</b> leaps out of the air after reaching the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> on Sunday. I love her personality, she's so spunky and curious! Definitely one of my favorite J Pod members, along with her brother (J26). - Photo by Heather MacIntyre.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It was another interesting mix of <b>part of J-Pod and part of K-Pod that headed up Swanson Channel</b> towards the Fraser River in the evening. In the mix was<b> J32 Rhapsody</b>, pictured here. The whales all stayed well north off the mouth of the river yesterday. - Monika Wieland.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A nice look at<b> K22 Sekiu </b>this evening while out with Legacy Charters up <b>in Swanson Channel</b>. - Monika Wieland.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>DoubleStuf: J34</b> does a great cartwheel! (AKA tail throw, peduncle throw, or tail breach). Several lobtails and some sharking under a wake trail preceeded this exuberant display. Wonderful trip with Ivan Reiff and Katie Jones. With Carla Mitroff. (I took this cell phone photo of the image display on my camera; no computer on this Whale Safari!). - Alisa Schulman-Janiger.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:25 pm - K pod came back in. Northbound with J. Henry Island to mid strait</b>. <b>6 yr old K42</b> Kelp with his MUCH bigger brother, 21 yr old, <b>K26 Lobo</b>. Today in <b>Haro Strait.</b> Severely backlit but these two guys are just too cool not to post. - James Gresham.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Woke up at about eight in the morning and heard the breathing of <b>orcas</b> as they headed south <b>past the south end of San Juan Island</b>. At twelve, I saw <b>Group A of J pod (plus the J22's) and all of K pod (minus the K21 crew?)</b> swim north past the house in a big resting line. But where was Group B of J pod? Soon after, I watched the same orcas from <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b> as they continued north. I was there for about an hour. At around four, I returned to Lime Kiln and saw <b>Group B (including the J16's and L87) </b>and<b> L pod (probably minus the L12's and L54's)</b> swim north. The orcas then all turned around and came back south. I believe Group A of J pod and K pod did not turn around but kept north for the Fraser River. I returned home a few minutes before seven. Saw around sixty one orcas today all together. - Melisa Pinnow

Enveloped by fog atop Kanaka Bay I could see on the west side cam Haro Strait was free of it.

She came north past me and then the lighthouse, the male stayed mostly south, the 3rd came even with me at the south end of the park...then they all turned south. All filled up with morning bliss I had to leave to come pack up. I hope we see them again before we leave this beautiful island. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Whales and weddings...Late afternoon with part of<b> J pod at Lime Kiln</b>. The pod was very spread out and just a few whales went past the lighthouse, Granny being one. On her return south she passed within 5-10 feet of the rocks. I had just meandered up to the picnic table and missed being that close to her but was still impressive, what an amazing whale is she. And just as the wedding couple finished exhcanging vows up in the lighthouse two Humpbacks surfaced to the south and continued north. Ed and I also had the pleasure to finally meet the other Alisa...

<b>Humpback</b> spotted o<b>ne and one half miles north/northwest of Point No Point</b>. I was motoring a 30' sailboat north through Admiralty Inlet when I spotted what I am fairly certain was <b>a lone humpback</b>. I first spotted it at 11:30 am, off Point No Point, and continued to observe it in the same one half mile square area for about 30 minutes as I passed through (I did not stop). The whale appeared to be feeding; it would surface and spout three to four times before arching it's back and showing it's flukes, apparently diving, staying down for five to ten minutes. It was not moving in any particular direction and seemed to have nearly completed a full half mile wide circle when I last observed it. It seemed vigorous and moved fast. From the closest observation distance of around 50 yards, I would estimate the size as around 30', give or take 5'. This combined with the large, clearly hooked dorsal fin and dark blue/black color leads me to believe it was a humpback and not a gray whale. I hope this information is helpful for your web site and I appreciate very much your keeping record of these sightings. - Colin Minch

On <b>August 20th, Js and Ks were up north by the Fraser River all day</b> and <b>Ls were westbound out the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. By the end of the day, however, word was <b>Js and Ks were southwest bound from East Point</b> and at least some of the<b> Ls had flipped and were coming back east</b>. Curious to see where everyone would end up in the morning, I went out to <b>Lime Kiln early on August 21st. Sure enough, around 7:00 a few whales came up from the south</b>, then flipped and went back. It turns out most of <b>K-Pod (at least the K12s, K13s, K14s</b>, though I think I saw K35 in there too) and maybe a few L-Pod whales were there. A friend told me she heard K-Pod on the hydrophones when they came down during the night, but Js must have turned back up north, as they were found off the Fraser River again. If Ls came back in, there were only a few of them, but I only saw them in poor lighting and wasn't able to confirm. This group did the westside shuffle all day - I saw them as they headed south from Land Bank around 4:15 PM. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Best night ever watching Orcas. Hands down. <b>Transient superpod and Residents coming down at East Point</b> as well- in the sunset. I think I died and went to heaven!! Just pure magic. (<i>Later Heather posted the below rendition of the very rare experience of encountering large numbers of both Residents and Transient/Bigg's about five miles apart at the same time.</i>)
<br/><b>Transient Super Pod, August 20, 2014 (and Residents)!</b> Wow, the orca sightings this summer have just been off the chart!! Killer whales are one of the world's most widely distributed mammalian species; there's actually ten different ecotypes (differing in their genetics, morphology, pigmentation, social structure, and vocalistic traditions entirely). The differences between each are entirely based on the different survival strategies they have, which are necessitated by their choice of prey. Biggs Killer whales, also known as Transients, are one of the ten ecotypes found throughout the Salish Sea. They feed on marine mammals, and are very good at exploiting that prey resource. Usually they are found in small numbers, in groups of four- six. When you have a smaller pod, it's easier to ambush intelligent prey! However, we saw <b>25+ transients in the same area, a phenomena known as a superpod. </b>It's very rare to see a group of Transients this large. We also got to met up with the other ecotype found in these waters, the<b> Southern Residents, coming south from Point Roberts in the sunset</b>. These orcas feed on salmon. The two species are known as sympatric species, existing in the same geographic location, but not competing for food or resources. It was probably one of the best nights of my life. The serenity of it all was just magical. Enjoy the photos, and please share with your friends! - Heather MacIntyre

Such an amazing day on the water. First trip we had a <b>minke whale</b>, porpoises, eagles, sea lions, and then we ended up near <b>False Bay </b>with lots of whales everywhere including <b>J22, J34, K26</b> and more. And out of nowhere comes a <b>Pacific White-Sided Dolphin </b>that bow rode us for a bit! So I thought it would be hard to top that trip--so for the afternoon trip we had eagles, seals, sea lions, an very cooperative minke whale. Ivan and I decided to go out to see some Transient Orcas, and wouldn't you know it--we found about <b>12 more Resident Orcas</b> including <b>L84 Nyssa</b> that no one knew were out there. Then over to see the Transients (<b>T36s, 37s</b>) and right as we got there everyone else left!!!

Great <b>afternoon in the Strait of Georgia with a very playful J pod!</b> It was one of the strangest fog days I've ever seen! Layers of fog were covering certain pockets of the water and the whales would wander in and out of it. The funny thing was that the fog was not very high off the water. <b>L87 Onyx and J26 Mike</b>'s dorsal fins would just be peeking out of the top of the fog layer while much of everything else stayed hidden. At one point we saw a cartwheel...sort of. We could only see the tail fly above the marine layer. Very amusing, indeed... - Katie Jones

<b>T065A's off Whidbey, Smith and Minor Islands</b>. This is a great group. The "Resident Transients." Incredibly skilled hunters. I hadn't seen them for a couple months. Little 6 month old T065A5 is looking great! On the hunt. One of the T065A's tail slaps a harbor porpoise into the air after a chunk of the porpoise's peduncle was bitten out, disabling it. After this, a whale does a half breach with the porpoise across it's back. Watching Transients hunt can be brutal but once you've seen enough hunts to understand the tactics they use and can disassociate yourself, they become a thing of beauty. - James Gresham

<b>Bells Beach, Langley, 11am -</b> We saw<b> four orca</b> moving quickly toward Langley this morning. They were not playing, breeching, etc., just cruising. There was a boat "Destiny" that sighted them and followed quite a ways away, but a smaller boat ahead of Destiny, was much more aggressive in their chase and got closer than what looked legal...granted it hard to ascertain from the shore. What a treat for us, however! - Margaret (Peggy) Sullivan

About <b>10:00 to 10:15 AM - Orca in Saratoga Passage</b>.

What a CRAZY day! Captain Spencer and I were watching <b>L87, Onyx</b> (a Resident Orca) forage and noticed something small trailing him. We knew it was too small to be an orca, and sure enough it was a <b>Pacific White-Sided Dolphin</b> (also known by locals as a Lag). The Lag proceeded to pester him for about an hour! He tried everything, ignoring it, tail slapping, and eventually started porpoising out of the water- he was so over it! Unfortunately for him, the Lag was just having way to much fun! However, we were able to steal him away for a little quality bow riding time. - Heather MacIntyre

<b>T041A2 </b>has survived that first critical year so its safe to designate it with the name Tree after Tree Island where it was likely born. Next step is to get an image of the calf breaching and showing it's belly so we can see if if it's a he/she. Her <b>mom T041A </b>is easily distinguished by her 2 notches but not to be confused with the similar fin to Wakana (T011). The mom and calf were alone when John was with them and we don't know if she returned to her matrilineal gang and if she didn't then she will likely be with another gang as she would be challenged to provide food if she just travelled on her own. If they are spotted, It would be great to get images to us right away. - Rod Palm, Strawberry Isle Marine Research Station, Tofino BC. - Howard Tom.

I thought maybe someone with knowledge would report the <b>large strung-out group of orcas off Ediz Hook Port Angeles</b> on Friday, August 15 at about <b>2pm</b>.

Tonight Kim Neall Bruder and I (and Zoe) Jumped in the boat and headed out to<b> Patos Island</b> to photograph the Super moon against the light house and hopefully Mt. Baker depending on where it came up. We were hoping to catch all 3 together. As we arrived we noticed a boat to our left watching someone paddling a small boat along the rocks. I grabbed the binoculars and realized there was <b>a pod of about 6 Transient whales </b>swimming all around him. We headed over to watch. Not realizing this guy was in a small inflatable rowboat and surrounded by feeding Transients. Not my first choice of boats in that situation! As usual they did not have any concern with him but you can see from the pictures that he had to be a little nervous. Talk about a sitting duck! The Transients moved on from him and proceeded to circle the whole island searching every cove along the way for seals. We followed them around the whole island and ended right back where we started at the lighthouse just in time for the Moon. What an unexpected surprise. Anyway this is what we ended up with. it was a little tricky getting a good shot of the light house with the ripping currents. It sure was fun trying. Outside of the currents it was like a lake out there. Oh, what a night! - Karl Bruder

We saw <b>members of all 3 pods, mostly J's and K's</b> and they were going off. Breaches, cartwheels, spy hops, pec slaps, tail slaps and throws all around us. Several J pod whales made very close approaches. J27 Blackberry was at ultra close range today. Being that close to a wild, adult male orca is a breathtaking thing. He popped up right next to us then turned and passed no more than 3 feet from the stern under water. - James Gresham.

Yesterday's encounter with the <b>T065A's</b> - what an awesome family, they are indeed my favorite group of transients!

Seen from south shore <b>Orcas Is, east of Doe Bay</b>. Whales first seen moving east towards Obstruction Pt from Pt Lawrence, in the channel north of the Peapod islands, sometimes coming in quite close to shore in Buoy Bay. Turned south along the east side of Obstruction Pt., headed south into the Rosario Strait, then turned back north towards South Peapod Is, fishing in the tidal lee of that island (east). Later moved east, in the channel south of the Peapods, but staying close to those rocks/islands, toward Lummi. Lost sight of them moving north around Pt. Lawrence. Many whale watching boats following along. Appeared to be fishing cooperatively, herding fish against rocky steep shorelines before feeding at the surface, or herding fish in the tidal lee of south Peadpod Is. Lots of apparently purposeful tail slapping (once, ~ 6 consecutive slaps by one animal "standing" on its head), some breaching. Incoming tide was flowing strongly. - Frank Peale

<b>7 transient killer whales (the T36A's and the T65A's</b>) attack a harbour porpoise in the most dramatic fashion. They threw it high in to the air, multiple times, all the while continuously breaching themselves! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 AM - There were 7-8 whales</b> in our sighting. One whale was significantly larger than the others and had a smaller whale who travelled continually beside it. The largest whale seemed to be leading the direction of the pod. Just off Epsom Point (30+ miles NW of Vancouver BC) heading northwest. They were initially feeding off the reef and then appeared to be playfully travelling together. - Regan Minchin.

No residents around the last two days but we've been lucky enough to find transient killer whales yesterday and today AND they were two different groups. Yesterday was the <b>T18's</b> whereas the group that showed up today was the<b> T30's</b>. Skipper Mark Malleson spotted these guys before he was even on the water. Mark spotted killer whales in Oak Bay, while eating breakfast, from his house! The T30's travelled steadily north and by the later afternoon they were too far away for us. They probably continued up and will head towards Vancouver. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

She said they are in two groups, one with 4 orcas on the Whidbey Island side, and another group with at least two on the Camano side, all trending northward.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I was sitting eating dinner and looking out over Saratoga Passage and noted the usual south bound Victoria Clipper just north of Langley. The boat stopped, reversed direction, and headed back north. I grabbed the binocs and went out on the neighbors bluff. I could see the blows from <b>approx. 6 orcas (transients?)</b> blowing and rolling on the surface. They looked like they were feeding, roughly<b> between Bell's Beach and Mabana</b>. The Clipper powered toward them, then slowed. They disappeared, to surface away from the boat. The boat zigzagged south to north several times, each time the orca disappeared for a short time, then again surfaced away from the boat and appeared to feed. They were moving very slowly to the north. The Clipper finally turned south to resume it's usual trip. - Barbara Brock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:45 - </b>Danielle Doll called from the Mukilteo ferry after seeing <b>3 or 4 spouts about a half mile south of the ferry</b>. They were too far to see which way they were traveling. A humpback was seen there about the same time.

The <b>humpback</b> I saw today didn't look like it had a destination to be at. I guess this makes sense since there were reports of a humpback a few miles away, but three hours later. It sure was a beautiful day in the Sound, that's where I'd be hanging. - Noah Izzard

What an afternoon with the <b>T037</b> family!!

We found them well north just about to enter the Strait of Georgia <b>between Patos Island and  Saturna's East Point</b>. And what perfect timing this was: Instantly they put on  a show of tail slapping and leaping repeatedly near the boat. I got a perfect double leap and lots of other leaps and flashy orca displays - in gorgeous light and high speed on the video in 4K!  On top of this we put down a GoPro after a calf, <b>T037B1</b>, showed up in the propeller current right under us taking a jacuzzi. And sure enough it came right up to the camera several times - the first underwater shots from here. For all of us it had been a very memorable trip. - Florian Graner
