May 2008
<br/>We saw orcas in Yaquina Bay this past May. In case you are interested there are some photos. They aren't great, but you can see the baby in one of them. 
<br/>Bruce Dugger, OR State University

<br/><br/>
Calvin Hunter called to report an <b>orca </b>sighting off the <b>Columbia River</b>. He saw ~ 5 orcas, including 1 adult male, 10 miles straight off the north jetty of the Columbia River, in 432' deep water, heading south. Lat/Long: 46 17N, 124 20.9W. 
<br/>*<br/>
Beam Reach's GPS system reported <b>J pod</b> off South Beach, SW San Juan Island (Latitude:48.4444 Longitude:-122.9998) at 1401 Saturday. At <b>1450 </b>Scott Veirs was hearing J pod calls and clicks from the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Beam Reach boat is with whales just S of Pile Point. By 1515 the GPS reading was Latitude:48.4569, Longitude:-123.0573, between South Beach and False Bay, SW San Juan Island.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach 
<br/>*<br/>
Members of <b>J pod</b> entered the study area (Limekiln, W. San Juan Island) at <b>1453 </b>heading north. 6 powerboats and 16 kayaks accompanied these whales through the study area. No boats were seen outside the study area. The last whale left the study area at 1513. Time from the first whale to the last whale over our line was 5 minutes, what we call our spread-out time. The rest of J pod entered our study area at 1538 heading north, though we only saw 14 pass over our line. 4 powerboats and 6 kayaks accompanied these whales through the study area. 17 powerboats were seen accompanying these whales outside the study area. The last whale left the study area at 1602. Time from the first whale to the last whale over our line was 19 minutes. Dividing this by 14 gives us what we call our spread-out time, in this case 1.36. this translates to mean that these whales were, on average, 1.4 minutes apart.
<br/>Bob Otis, Lime Kiln Lighthouse 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Humpback </b>Sighting - Pender Island. This evening at <b>7:35 pm</b>, we observed a large animal 50 metres south of Thieves Bay Marina and 100 metres offshore. Seconds later we heard a loud breath followed by the appearance of an arching back and then black flukes. This apparent humpback then showed us the underside of its flukes (7:38pm), which were almost solid white. It looked to be headed in a southerly direction in Swanson Channel. We scanned the horizon for the next 20 minutes but did not see it again. Our first thoughts were that this was a young adult whale. In five years, this the first time we have seen a humpback (if it was a humpback?) in Swanson Channel.

<br/><br/>
Today's trip took us back again to Point Roberts (see Tuesdays report) to spend time with <b>J-Pod</b>. We had an interested group, calm seas, and sunshine to make the day even better. We spent about an hour with J-Pod watching them forage as they headed south towards Rosario. They were all spread out and we began our encounter with J-8, Speiden, and then moved on to view J-1, Ruffles, and J-2, Granny. Granny is the matriarch of J-Pod and estimated to be nearly 100 years old!!! 
<br/>Megan, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris 
<br/>*<br/>
From the Beam Reach GPS tracker, we have received whale reports of <b>J pod</b> beginning at <b>1320 </b>just south of Pt. Roberts, heading south (Latitude:48.9297, Longitude:-123.0429 ) and ending at 1908 in Rosario Strait, between Lummi and Orcas Islands (Latitude:48.6856, Longitude:-122.7384 ).

Lisa Schlender and I headed out of Westport for one of our monthly outer coast marine mammal surveys. We found a <b>gray whale</b> with a very small calf right off the north jetty of Grays Harbor, lots of <b>harbor porpoises</b> within about 5 miles of shore, several small groups of Dall's porpoise offshore, and four <b>humpbacks</b>, including one calf, about 10 miles off Westport. 
<br/>Erin Andrea Falcone, Cascadia Research Collective 
<br/><br/>
<b>May 28, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> was spread out over a few miles, milling, not much tidal exchange, on the south end of San Juan Island. From <b>1:22pm to 2:24pm</b> we were treated to a variety of behaviours- spy hops, breaches, cartwheels, headstands, pectoral &amp; fluke slaps. J-32 Rhapsody did a slow rollover pass by. We were also able to ID J-22, Oreo &amp; the kids J-34 Doublestuf, J-38 Cookie, J-2 Granny (relieved to see her return each year), and the 'boys', teenagers J-26 Mike &amp; J-27 Blackberry. We also enjoyed continuous vocalizations! Saw kelp draping over rostrums- is it this year's game? From my perspective, it looked like all the boats were following the regulations. SoundWatch was out in their new boat - I hope they agree. Beam Reach was also out doing their research. And the 'pooper scoopers' were following J-26, it was kinda funny, because at one point he turned so they immediately turned away from him, then he was following them! J-26 is getting bigger than their boat! 
<br/>*<br/>
Just got in off the FREEMAN last night on a FE salmon feed study cruise. Saw fair numbers of large whales - <b>Grey, fin &amp; Humpback</b> + the highlight was a dusk passing of a big male <b>KW</b>, at least two females and a calf when we were about 50 miles west of Willapa bay (46 40'N 124 47'W) . Time was approximately 19:20. Animals appeared to be moving in a Northerly direction. 
<br/>Rick Brown, Captain NOAA CORPS (Ret.), Resource Management Specialist, NOAA/NMFS/NWFSC Newport Research Station 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> - Pender Island <b>2025 </b>. We just had three whales off our property on Mouat Point, North Pender Island. The male has a definite Port side bend to the dorsal fin, the other two appeared to be smaller, with smaller dorsal fins;  females or juveniles? They were feeding and there was one huge leap before they continued Northwestward up Swanson Channel. Oops, just caught the sounds and brief sight of 3 or 4 more, following the first group. no id of any.  
<br/>Marti Tilley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> - Pender Island, between <b>7:30pm and 8:45pm</b>, we observed members of J-Pod pass Thieves Bay on Pender Island. We were on shore and counted 19-20 orcas in total. They were well spread out, heading north and with J26 leading the way. A female and calf followed quite close behind him (J16 and J42?). A little ways behind these three were another female and, what appeared to be, another calf. The first whales were travelling quite quickly, but as more swam by their behaviours varied: some obvious foraging, several pec and tail slaps, a couple of breaches and one spy hop. Most of the pod were a fair distance offshore so identification was difficult. J1 was seen 1000 metres offshore close to the back of the group. J34 was the only other male that we were able to specifically ID, but at least one other was present. There wasn't a single power or sailboat in sight, well there was one whale watching boat near Oaks Bluff, but it left before J-Pod reached Thieves Bay. 
<br/>Richard Philpot, Pender Island
<br/>*<br/> 
Beam Reach was with <b>orcas </b>(likely J pod) today, beginning west of Iceberg Pt, S. Lopez Island (Latitude:48.5302 Longitude:-123.1706) at <b>1515</b>, moving W/NW.  Their last report was north of Lime Kiln, west San Juan Island at <b>1642 </b>(Latitude 48.5302 Longitude:-123.1706 ). 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b>, Lime Kiln, 22 members of J pod milling entered the study area heading north at <b>1516</b>, leaving the study area at <b>1605</b>. These whales were accompanied by two boats in the study area, one a CG cutter, 755 yds. out at <b>1601</b>. There were 10 boats accompanying them just outside the study area. 9 tailslaps and 6 cartwheels recorded. Considerable vocalization. 
<br/>Bob Otis 
<br/>*<br/> 
We heard <b>J pod</b> on orcasound at Lime Kiln at <b>9:43 AM</b>.

The (<b>humpback</b>) whale is still at Pt. Defiance and I got a great look at the underside of his tail. I didn't have my camera but may be able to identify or at least narrow it down through photos. If this worked then I attached a pretty bad drawing of what it looked like, the edges of white were broken towards the end of the tail on the inside. I watched him for about 45 minutes where he came up at least 30 times. Also, I saw him feeding on something at the surface. Before I left he was going in a pretty straight line and surface 7 or 8 times in about a minute then made a tight turn then dived. Just after there was a large disturbance on the surface and then I started seeing him/her reapetly surface in about a 50ft by 50ft area. Got some good views of his pectoral fins as he was turning and breaking the surface in a tight circle. Several birds including an Eagle were right above and a couple Harbor Seals were nearby.

<br/>*<br/>
The <b>humpback </b>is still hanging around Point Defiance and the southwest side of Vashon Island. I watched him/her on and off between <b>10:50 AM</b> and <b>1:15 PM</b> spending most of its time about half-way between Vashon and Point Defiance.

Ken Balcomb, John Durban, and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research observed <b>Transient orcas</b> in Haro Strait from <b>5:36-6:35 p.m.</b>. Start Lat/Long: 48° 31.43 N, 123° 13.37 W; End Lat/Long: 48° 35.93 N, 123° 14.40 W. T102 and T20 were traveling at a medium pace nothbound through Haro Straight about 200 meters from T21,T101,T101A and T101C.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>T40</b> inbound from Race Rocks headed for Victoria - report and photograph from Mark Malleson, via the Center for Whale Research. 
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Jim Maya called to report <b>J pod</b> 1 mile off the east tip of Pt. Roberts at <b>3:30 pm</b>, heading south down Rosario, maybe toward Boundary Pass.
<br/>*<br/>
I'm sure Alison will send you a report of our incredible day, but here's a picture (or two) that pretty well sums up how well it went:  (it really is nice to have a big zoom lens so we can see up close while staying our distance!) 
<br/>John Boyd (JB) Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
We started our trip today with the news that <b>J-pod</b> was up at Sandy Point (near Vancouver BC) and heading north. Eventually Ivan said it looks good and off we went to Point Roberts. As we all eagerly searched for dorsal fins alas there was J1. It was almost as if he wanted to make sure we saw him. He logged on the surface for 2 minutes; you could not miss him. He did this a few times before joining up with J26 &amp; J27 for some male bonding.
<br/>Alison Engle, Naturalist, Western Prince Cruises, Friday Harbor, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
Report of <b>orcas </b>off Village Pt., Lummi Island at <b>9:30 p.m</b>. - not sure of direction - very spread out - thanks Cindy Dahlstrom.
<br/>Penny Stone Lummi Island
<br/>*<br/>
We headed straight for Point Roberts in hopes of meeting <b>J-Pod</b> who was at the coal docks and traveling south towards the Rosario Strait. We got positive ID's on <b>J-1, J-2, J-16, J-42, J-26, and J-11. J-26</b>, aka Mike, also breached over five times right in front of us! They were spy hopping, pec slapping, tail lobbing, breaching, and cartwheeling about.
<br/>Megan Young, naturalist (San Juan Safaris)
<br/>*<br/>  
The (<b>humpback</b>) whale never did lift its fluke today so we had to settle for photos of the body. We left it at about <b>3:30pm</b>, just out front of the ferry terminal at Point Defiance, still milling around in Dalco Passage as it has been reported recently. After pouring over numerous dorsal fin photos of the three individuals that have been identified in the south sound since 2004, we tend to think this whale is new to the area, even though it is similar in appearance to two others seen previously (which is why we prefer to identify humpbacks by their more distinctive flukes, if they are nice enough to show them!). Based on some fairly low-resolution photos, we are reasonably certain it is the same whale photographed in Mutiny Bay on 26 April, though. It is not a very young whale, although I would classify it as a smaller adult. All in all, its skin and body condition look pretty good. It does have a broad, shallow depression just behind the blowhole on the right side of the head, not sure what to make of it, but the whale seems to be doing fine so far otherwise.
<br/>Erin Andrea Falcone, Cascadia Research 
<br/>*<br/>
After reading the weekend posts on the Pt. Defiance <b>Humpback </b>I just went down to see if I could get another look this morning (before <b>10:30 am</b>). After about 5 minutes at the first over look on the five mile drive it came up for 4 quick breaths. It was on the Pt. Defiance side and close to shore heading towards Gig Harbor. I was there another 20 minutes or so without anymore sightings.
<br/>Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa.
<br/>*<br/> 
Derek Woodie called to relay more reports of the <b>humpback </b>whale - co-workers saw it at <b>8 am</b> from the Vashon ferry, and Derek saw it again at <b>6:50 pm</b> off the SW point of Vashon Island.  
<br/><br/>
<b>May 26, 2008</b>
<br/><br/>
Orca Network forwarded photos from a report of a pod of <b>orcas </b>off Wadah Island near Neah Bay, WA to Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research, who replied:
One of the the bulls, I think, is <b>T102</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report from Sarah Miller of 30 to 40 <b>orcas </b>- appeared to be a very large, spread-out pod, 1/8 mile east of Snow Creek on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, approx 200 yards off beach, traveling west, approx <b>2 p.m</b>. They seemed to be playing - lots of breaching, tail- lobbing, spy-hopping, at least one was a large adult male. 
<br/>*<br/>
It's possible that what we saw was in fact a <b>Minke </b>whale and not an Orca. Some others in the Edmonds, Kingston, Bainbridge area have spotted a couple of Minke whales lately. And I guess  they also can exhibit the breaching or "porpoising" behavior we saw the other night.
<br/>Dave Haas, Shoreline, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
I sighted a pod of <b>orcas </b>while I was kayak fishing near <b>Cape Mendocino CA</b> today. There were approximately 4-5 females with a at least one very distinct male. Although I did not have a camera at the time, the dorsal fin of the male was very distinctive. It was notched almost as if there were a separate finger-like appendage protruding from the tip. I saw it multiple times and would be able to identify it if you have images of dorsals from males known to frequent northern CA. Time: Approximately <b>1500</b>. Location: 40 23' 44.56" N   124 23' 44.56" W, almost on top of "Devil's Gate Rock." The animals did not seem to feeding, maybe playing. The male spy-hopped few times to take a look at us. They were slapping their flukes on the water surface often. They were heading north.
<br/>Dave 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report from Gerg Barcello, reporting 15 <b>orcas </b>off Wadah Island, near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, milling and heading west to Neah Bay, from <b>3-4 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Jpod </b>coming back East at <b>1730 </b>off Sooke. 
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Just letting you know that we left <b>J pod</b> at <b>1940 </b>, and they were about 5 miles south of the entrance to Victoria Harbor, heading east. They were all within a 1/2 mile of each other, travelling slowly east. Seems as though they turned around at about 1400 and headed back east along the coast of southern Vancouver Island. Perhaps we'll see them back around San Juan in the morning. It's 0030 as I write this but I'm not hearing anything on the hydrophones.
<br/>A few minutes later: Just as I sent that previous email through I began to hear J pod calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone! It's 12:39am Tues 27th May and I can just hear them over the cargo ship going by.
<br/>Tim Hunt Orca Spirit Naturalist/former Beam Reach student 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod</b> heading back in! They made it to Sheringham Pt. before turning around. Should be near San Juan late tonight! (Later) Hearing vocals of J's at 11:30 PM!!!  YIPPEEE! 
<br/>John Boyd (JB) Marine Naturalist, Western Prince
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed a report of <b>J pod</b> off Sheringham Pt. (So. Vancouver Island), heading west out of the Strait of Juan de Fuca at about <b>1:30 pm</b>.   
<br/>*<br/>
Read the report this morning of a <b>humpback </b>in the area so went down to look around and within 2 min spotted what I believe is a Minke*  whale between Pt. Defiance and Vashon Island moving back and forth. We watched for about 45 min. then went around the corner more towards the Narrows and did not see anything else.
<br/>Derek Woodie 
<i>* From the photo above, this is definitely the humpback whale that's been in the area - note the shape of the fin in the photo above (I like to think of a humpback fin and back as looking like a big chocolate chip on the water!) - below is a photo of a Minke whale fin, which has more of a sickle shape.

<br/><br/>
We received a call from Daniel, reporting a sighting of 6 <b>Orcas </b>off Neah Bay. They were off Duncan Rocks, near Tatoosh, at about <b>6-6:30 pm</b>, heading toward Port Angeles. There were several large, adult male fins.   
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received another report of <b>orcas </b>off Ft. Bragg, CA, Sunday at <b>5 pm</b>, heading north near Virgin Creek, toward McKerricher State Park. They were milling and cruising outside the surf zone.                                                              
<br/>*<br/>
Lime Kiln, <b>16:56 - J pod</b> milling/north  - 9 members of J pod passed through the study area beginning at 1656 heading north. Three powerboats accompanied them. Left the study area at 1732.  
17:52 - J pod turned around north of the study area and reentered the study area heading south at 1752.  At least 22 members of J pod were seen, at least 7 of whom passed by close to the kelp. 5 powerboats accompanied these whales, with one approaching within 50 yards of the whales about 1834. <b>1850 </b>was the reported time the last whale left the study area heading south. At 1855, 4 more whales, including J30, passed by just outside the kelp, heading south.   
<br/>Bob Otis, Lime Kiln, west San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>gray whale</b> was again in front of our community. I  was looking down on the beach at yesterday's feeding pits about <b>3:30 PM</b> and spotted the gray whale spouting out over the drop-off (The tide  was still out quite a ways). This evening about 10 PM, I stepped out on the deck, and could again hear the whale feeding close in below  the bluff as the tide was now in and it could get into the ghost  shrimp beds.  Maybe our ghost shrimp have reached just the right  state of tastiness!  It's such a privilege to share with them.

Writing to report a spectacular sighting in Dalco Pass. I live on the water a few houses up from the Tahlequah ferry dock, facing out towards the southwest over dalco pass, point defiance park and gig harbor.  Over the past 2 weeks we've had multiple sightings. First, the mist from the "blow", then the dark shape with notch. I also heard him blow quite close by on several occasions without actually seeing him.  Yesterday (sat 5/24) and today (sun 5/25) we were treated to a lot of tail-flipping. This morning its tail flipped out about 7 or 8 times in succession, every 10 seconds or so. Then he waved an enormous fin, which was dark on the topside and speckled with white underneath. Had binocs for pretty good viewing, and will keep camera on hand for the next show.

We had the pleasure of having one <b>gray whale</b> spend from at least <b>5:30 PM</b> through past <b>midnight</b>(!!) in the shallow  ghost shrimp beds close in in front of our community south of the Mabana Rd. (west Camano Island). Having such a large creature so  close for so long was an unforgettable experience for us, and  especially for our company.  Usually the whales don't linger, but feed as they are passing by. There was the usual lying over on it's side with pec fin and tail fluke up, but there also seemed to be an unusual amount of sidewise tail thrashing.

Extraordinary ballet of <b>J Pod</b> today off Salmon Bank. J-Pod reported north bound near Cyprus Island, seen off the ferry around <b>7:00p.m.</b> this evening.

We had an incredible day with <b>J Pod</b> today! The afternoon was spent off South Beach watching five [<b>orcas</b>] as they headed south and toward Salmon Bank Buoy. They did a lot of traveling south, then foraging and heading out into Haro Strait, only to turn and work back toward the beach. These were all <b>J Pod</b> females and youngsters.
On our evening trip we found <b>J Pod</b>, grouped up and traveling around the south eastern tip of Lopez Island. The question was, will they go across Rosario and toward Deception Pass? Or up Rosario Strait? The whales got really active as they rounded the tip of Lopez. Then they split a little into sub groups, and yes! They headed up  Rosario Strait! There were many tail slaps, a few breaches, some spy hopping, then  more speedy travel. Ruffles had quite a crowd around him as he majestically came to the surface, and then slowly disappeared - going  down, down, down. Another sub group with Polaris, J-28 was on the  flank. On this surprisingly warm afternoon - evening it was such a  pleasure to watch the whole family head north with good energy. It  was easy to spot J-26, J-30, J-19, J-41, as well as J-16 and J-42.
We left the J's at Bird Rocks in Rosario Strait at <b>6:35 p.m.</b> and  headed back to the west to Friday Harbor.

<b>J-Pod</b> was foraging on the southwest side (near salmon bank) and we got an incredible show. The sun was shining, the air was warm, the sea was calm, and J-Pod was active! The Sea Lion began our encounter watching three females, but then turned closer to shore to be with the Kittiwake and a group of orcas they were observing. J-28, J-26, J-14, and J-42 were all confirmed in this group and just as we were approaching the Kittiwake an orca exploded out of the water in one of the closest breaches we've had yet! The whale conveniently jumped about 115 yards off the port side of the Kittiwake and about 150 yards in front of the Sea Lion!!! We believe it was J-26 who breached, but it happened so suddenly that we didn't get the greatest look at who it was. J-Pod has been good to us lately and we send them many thanks for such a great show!

Early Friday evening from <b>5PM to 6:30PM</b>; watched/enjoyed from theatre type setting on a sloping hill, a single <b>gray whale</b>. N.E. side of Polnell Point (Oak Harbor) is a half moon bay. Totally calm, as gray kept slowiy cruising along the half moon shoreline. Going one direction, then turning around and going along the half moon bay in opposite direction. Possibly, feeding on something, other, than ghost/sand shrimp. Some, but not much swooshing around as is usually observed, when feeding on shrimp. Maybe, needlefish, as I have seen grays before feeding on needlefish on Crescent Harbor side of Polnell Point.

You know its a good day when you get to take a beach stroll with a <b>humpback </b>whale. I went down to the South end of Vashon again around <b>1:30</b> today and sure enough saw spouts and some rolling pec fins just off Point Dalco. The water was absolutely flat, the tide was out and the whale was only about 50 feet off shore. As I hit that section of the beach there was not another person in sight. No boats either. Just me and a whale. I spent about 1/2 hour that way. The whale slowly moving along the shoreline and me walking along with him ( or her).  As the tide changed, the whale moved a bit farther out and lucky me got to see some fabulous fluking. Watched until about 3:30 and at that point the whale had moved to the other side and was just off Point defiance.

We got positive IDs on <b>J-1, J-8, J-16, J-42, J-26, and J-27</b>. It was much easier to see them today because they were traveling together and moving slow. We began our encounter at <b>2pm </b>about 1/2 mile off Lime Kiln Lighthouse and traveled with them for a while heading north, up the west side of San Juan Island. Little J-42 proved to be a favorite again as she popped up frequently in the middle of the pack. A point of interest: We learned from Gato Verde, the Beam Reach boat, that the orcas were not very vocal today (an unusual occurrence). There were no calls or clicks, which proved curious to the Beam Reach group. Like I've said before... every day is a new experience and we've barely scratched the surface of all there is to learn.

Orca Network received a call from a reporter for the Eureka (CA) Times Standard about an <b>orca </b>that charged up on a beach and grabbed a harbor seal. Half of the whale's body was out of the water. The whale then tossed the seal away and slid back into the water. At least 3 juvenile orcas were nearby. Was it all a hunting lesson for the young ones? He said there were some reports of a larger group of orcas further offshore. Orcas are known to beach themselves to catch sea lions in Patagonia, Argentina and in the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean, but this is believed to be the first report of an orca grabbing a seal off a beach in North America. This occurred in front of about a dozen people who all tell the same basic story. The beach is called Indian Beach, in Trinidad Bay, about 20 miles north of Eureka CA, near the Humbolt Bay Marine Lab. The story will appear in the above paper tomorrow. No photos were taken as far as the reporter knows.

We had <b>J14, J26, J27, J30, J40 and 2 others</b> just rolling around on top of one another, pushing each other around, rolling in kelp, logging on the surface, sticking their noses out of the water, tail lobbing, and a couple of large surface percussives. Our <b>afternoon </b>trip we had <b>J16, J26, and J42</b> about 8 miles south of the morning location (the rest of J-Pod was spread out over a 5-7 mile radius) and again it was so neat to see a family grouping just milling about somewhat aimlessly in the glassy waters.

The "mystery" whale (that's yesterday's minke-like mystery whale, not the humpback off Pt. Defiance), IS exactly what I saw on Sunday morning, May 18, 10:41AM near the ferry line, between the Duwamish Head, Alki Point &amp; Smith Cove Marina. (Although, there were 3!, one considerably larger than the other 2.) My guess is that they were Minkes? We maintained sight of them for about 15 minutes and got several good looks @ each via kayak.

Attached is a photo taken last weekend off of Seattle, just north of the Winslow/Seattle Ferry lane about in the middle of the Sound. This whale was swimming toward my boat and I saw it from about 250 yards away. I stopped / engine off and waited. The animal surfaced next to me heading 180 degrees to my course, about fifty feet to starboard. I was struck by the long body (maybe 35 - 40 feet) the flat back between the blow hole (sorry I know little whale terminology) and the mid back. It glided for about 1.5 - 2.5 seconds and then dove slowly. In diving it displayed it's small dorsal fin, but the tail didn't break the surface. Interesting fact was that the exhaled breath stank like a room full of herring (we were down wind of the whale). Standing at water level I could not see the underwater parts as the sun was to one side and therefore couldn't confirm diagonal strips on the side fins.
My guess is that it was a Minke whale. Does the back and fin look compatible with that?
I've boated for forty years in Puget Sound and the SJ's, this whale definitely seemed very different from female Orca  and Dahl's porpoises. I once saw a similar whale in the middle of the Straits of Juan de Fuca but that was from a long way away.
I appreciate any response.

<i>This does look like a minke, but minkes only get to about 26-28' long, so does that seem possible? It could be a juvenile fin whale if it's 35-40 feet, but they are pretty rare around here. Anyone have a diagnosis? -hg</i>

While sailing between Point Defiance Park and Vashon Island (Area 11 of Puget Sound) during the <b>mid-afternoon</b> I observed a large whale. The whale appeared to be dark blue or black in color, blew water high  into the air several times, and circled the area for the hour I observed it. I believe the whale was a <b>Humpback</b>, but I am not an expert at whale identification. In any event, I was able to take a few photos of the whale's dorsal fin. I'm sure anyone aboard the Vashon Ferry the afternoon of May 18th also saw this whale.

Re: "lone Gray Whale" off East Pt. I was in my kayak around <b>6:15</b> along Bells Beach heading toward a boat in the cove, when all of the sudden, "WHhoooosh!" a gray whale exhaled right off my shoulder very close to shore heading south! I nearly jumped out of my kayak! I thought it looked like a calf and raced out deeper (gray being shoreside) to give it some room. I was also bracing for an adult, but it was alone- definitely a gray with the white crab patches/barnacles. The boat took off, probably thinking I was coming to report it, but they must have seen my surprise. Of course, I didn't have my camera.

<b>J-Pod</b> had been seen just around Alden Bank at the top of Rosario Strait. Once in Rosario, we noticed that the J's were spread out from side-to-side in a swath of maybe 1 to 1 1/2 miles across. It was so cool to see J22 Oreo traveling with her two kids Doublestuff (J34) and Cookie. J34 was feeling mighty frisky as he did several half-breaches, and one very large breach that had him completely out of the water.

Some friends on the South end of [Vashon Island] called me at <b>3;40</b> with a report of the <b>minke/humpback mystery whale</b>. Sounds like it was in the same spot as the morning sighting. I'll try to go do some scouting tomorrow.

Orca Network received a call Monday AM from Gregory Gilbertson about a sighting of roughly ten orcas <b>~2:30 PM</b>, approx. 25 miles west of <b>Newport OR</b> (240 degrees from Newport), in an area known as the "chicken ranch." He described them as hunting whales so these may have been Transients (or Offshores? or Residents?).

<b>J POD</b> passing by Andrews Bay at<b> 8:30 PM</b> heading north very slowly. I was on my way out around 7:30 but the water got pretty rough, but by the time I saw them at 8:30, the water was flat calm again. Last saw them passing Kellett Bluff still going north!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> was here. The pod traveled up west San Juan Island in the morning, turned around at Lime Kiln and made wonderfully close passes along the beach. Many calf spyhops, almost as many adult spyhops, lots of the spyhops? where they come way out of the water and fall backwards, tail lobs, tail slaps, and rolling over and rolling over each other. J27 (Blackberry) was doing many angled dives seemingly right on top of other whales. As they went south in the afternoon fighting the flood tide, they swam in place in some of the rip currents for up to half an hour or more. It seemed they were exhibiting lots of the behaviors you see in superpods.

Sighted a <b>whale </b>this <b>AM </b>approximately .75 nm west of the Tahlequah Ferry dock, Vashon Island. Solitary, inconspicuous blow, prominent dorsal fin, didn't show fluke when it dove - looked more like a minke but we did not see white sides.

Near Strawberry Point (NE Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island). Around <b>10:30 PM</b> or so, I heard a sound like a neighbor opening/closing sliding door. When it happened 30 seconds later right in front of me I knew it was sound of a whale spout. Stepped outside tent and heard/saw puff of a third spout in light of a full moon. Neat stuff!!! Heard fourth and final spout as whale was just passing through heading southwest towards Polnell Point. Most likely a single <b>gray </b>as we have had prior gray visits this spring.

Regarding the Point Defiance "Mystery Whale," I believe I saw the same animal from afar on the afternoon of the 16th in the same area. I'm voting <b>humpback</b>; dorsal was too small/blunt to be a minke, and the shape of the back didn't strike me as a gray whale would. (/twocents)

I was sailing with 3 friends yesterday evening around <b>7:30 or 8:00 p.m.</b> and three of us sighted what appeared to be a fin whale. The whale (or whales--Ken saw one first and Mark &amp; I saw one a few minutes later) was dark sable brown, very large, moving slowly on the surface for about 10 seconds. It dived, keeping its back low in the water, bending at the base of the tail without exposing its tail. At the break in its back (i.e., the flex point between the body and tail), a small, scimitar-shaped dorsal fin was seen clearly. The whale was very large, on the scale of a grey or humpback (which it did not resemble). Two of us have seen fin whales in the Bering Sea, so they aren't unfamiliar to us. Still, a live fin whale would be unusual in Puget Sound.
Later that evening, I also saw an unusual orca whale, what I think might have been a lone female. It seemed unusually large for a female, but it had a very "bent" --scimitar-shaped-- dorsal fin, so I assumed it must be female. Its back was all black, no visible saddle, no notches or distinctive marks. (The light level was good enough to have seen a bright saddle, but maybe not a dark grey one.) It did not show its head or tail and I didn't see it again.At the time of the whale sightings, we were west southwest from Shilshole marina, slightly north of Murden Cove , in the south- bound shipping lane. Murden Cove is Degrees Minutes Seconds: Latitude: 473906N Longitude: 1223022W Decimal Degrees: Latitude: 47.65167 Longitude: -122.50611

We watched <b>J pod</b> foraging and playing a few miles off Saturna heading eastward towards Point Roberts. We got great looks at J-1 and J-26 as well as a group of unidentified J-Pod females. They seemed to be in high spirits and breached and spy hopped multiple times. We even got looks at a dozen Steller Sea Lions hauled out on Boiling Reef as well as Harbor Seals hauled out nearby.

At about <b>1240</b>, while surveying for marbled murrelets from R/V Rosi, I came across <b>J pod</b> passing by Iceberg Point heading towards San Juan Island. They were moving at about 5kts in classic "groups spread out" formation, probably occupying at least one square mile of water. I was able to see J19, J41, J16, J36, and J42 together with J26 a bit farther out, followed by the J11's, then the J22's and J17's together, while what I'm assuming were all of the J14's passed by about .5 miles away (I could only confirm J30 but he was with two other female-sized and a juvenile, which would make sense). Other animals were passing by well outside of binocular range. We left them as they were passing Long Island and approaching Middle Channel.

<br/><i>In looking at the photos, and noting the location, we are thinking this might be the juvenile <b>humpback </b>whale that has been in the area and was recently spotted off Pt. Defiance.

A pod of <b>orca </b>surfaced around me in Ladysmith Harbor (south of Nanaimo, BC). They stuck with me from outside Transfer Beach through the narrows and all the way down to the sawdust barge pier at the mills, about 2 NM. Distance varied between 5 and 15 meters the entire way. 5 of them, I am pretty sure. A calf and an adult that always surfaced together, two adults that always surfaced together, and a single adult that was always by himself. Or there might have been two singles, but no way to be sure. They were short dorsal fin, by the way, and all seemed to have sort of lighter grey patch somewhat in front of the dorsal fin.

Not an orca, but black, long, 2 fin - maybe a psueorca. 1 of them, off the south side of vashon.

Bill Applegate called Orca Network to report at least 2 <b>orcas</b>, observed from Joseph Whidbey State Park from <b>10-10:15 am</b>. They were between NW Whidbey and Lopez Island, way out in the channel, heading SW toward Smith Island.

Orca Network received calls from Carolyln Mercer and Mary Pacher, at <b>3 pm and 3:05 pm</b>, reporting a <b>gray whale</b> off Hidden Beach, N. of Greenbank. We got down to the beach at 3:25, and watched one gray feeding back and forth, in and out, until after <b>5 pm</b> when we had to leave (it was still there feeding!). It didn't show its back very often, but from what we could see of the dorsal ridge and the flukes, we are pretty sure it was Dubnuk/#44. (see photo above - the left side of the fluke has a flattened tip with 3 distinctive white circles on it.

I was at Marina Beach Park in Edmonds around <b>8 pm</b> when I happened to look out at the end of the pier, probably about 400-500 feet away. I saw a <b>gray </b>breaking the water in a slow leisurely roll, never showing its tail and heading North. All I saw was the back of its back, starting about a foot in front of the "bumps" and then continuing on through all of the "bumps". (I'm sure they have a proper name, but I'm too lazy right now to look it up). What I saw was probably about 6-10 feet long. It continued on, leaving my sputtering in amazement.

I just got a reply from Graeme on the identity of the <b>Transient </b>orca sprouter. He said it was <b>T73B </b>and has not been seen for a few years. Also, I have been calling T90's juvenile T90A and I am wrong. I guess T90 did have a previous calf sometime (?) and lost it and her current juvenile is T90B.

<br/>*<br/> 
Just thought I'd add a little more info about the Transients sighted off Victoria. It seems as though we picked up the T's where Dave Ellifrit left them. We had a 1pm trip and came out of Victoria Harbor and they were approx. 2 miles SW of the Ogden Pt Breakwater. They then hugged the shoreline and swam right up against the breakwater, with one of the individuals rolling over and giving the lucky people walking along the breakwall a nice view of its white underside. It was amazing to see them right at the tip of Ogden Pt at the mouth of Victoria Harbor. They then crossed the mouth of the harbor and headed in a general SW direction towards Albert Head.

Here is a bit more on the <b>transients </b>I was out on: I left Snug harbor at 1055-overcast and mostly calm- and got on scene around <b>1135 </b>just west of the Chain Islets. The eight whales were tight and heading southwest at a medium speed. The whales present were T87, T88, T90, T90A, T124, T124D, T124E, and a sprouter who I don't remember seeing before. I will have to send a picture of him off to Graeme for an I.D. By around 1155, the whales were off the south tip of Trial Island still tight but had slowed down a bit. Most of the whales appeared to be resting but T124E and the sprouter were just slightly off to the side rolling around together. I saw a seasnake from those two that I think belonged to T124E so am pretty confident he is a young male. I left the whales with a couple Victoria boats at <b>1238 </b>about 2 miles southwest of Trial Island. The whales were still tight and slowly heading southwest.

We traveled all the way to Albert Head, west of Victoria Harbor. J-Pod had traveled too far north, but the <b>Transients </b>were in reach. After a super calm journey across the Haro Strait, past Discovery Island, and beyond Victoria Harbor, we made it to our prince charming (a large Transient male). Our guests got some amazing views of the group of 6- 8 Transients, which included multiple females, a juvenile, an unknown sprouter (juvenile male), and an adult male. The orcas appeared to have caught a Harbor Seal because there was an oil slick in the water just behind them and the sea gulls were going nuts, diving in and out of the water. The orcas gave us some fabulous views as they surfaced just off Albert Point, providing the perfect backdrop for photos.

We found<b> J-Pod</b> coming through Active Pass at <b>1:15 p.m</b>. We had heard that they were near Enterprise Reef up at the top of Swanson's Channel, so our route today took us to the east entrance of Active Pass in the Strait of Georgia. We decided to wait in Miner Bay and as soon as we settled in, we sighted a huge breach as the lead whale came "around the bend" in Active Pass. Most of the whales stuck close to the north side of the pass, with a few stops for foraging off the ferry landing. We floated along in the current, watching as what must have been the entire family, picked up speed and moved on, out into the Strait of Georgia. Ruffles and Granny went way up to the north, an outer escort of two? The rest of J-Pod moved along in smaller sub pod groups, stopping to tail slap, pec slap, do a few belly rolls, and then continue on across toward the Fraser River. As we left, about <b>2:15 p.m</b>., I noticed J-26, Mike, as he stopped to do a fast turn around, some foraging behavior, and then onward toward the river.

Beam Reach met up with <b>J-pod</b> about a nautical mile south of Bird Rocks in Rosario Strait between <b>2:00 and 2:30pm</b>. We followed them south as they hugged the shore of Lopez Island in a rather spread out fashion. We observed lots of exciting surface behaviors such as pectoral slapping, tail slapping, breaches, half breaches and spy hopping. We had deployed a hydrophone array off the stern of our vessel, the Gato Verde, consisting of three hydrophones as well as a high frequency hydrophone, also off our stern. The whales were not vocalizing for at least 45 minutes when we first got to them, luckily, however, the pod became very acoustically active for a short period of time, emitting a large amount of echo location clicks, S1, S3, and S4 calls, and surprisingly, an unusual amount of whistles. They soon fell silent again and intermittently made echo location clicks and S1 calls. As the whale watching fleet slowly left the vicinity, the whales became more and more spread out and we left them at <b>5:30pm</b> near the Salmon Bank buoy. They seemed to be milling non- directionally, though we got a message from Orca Spirit stating that they were slowly moving west when they left the scene at around <b>7:00pm</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>J-Pod</b> in Rosario Channel in three distinct groups slowly heading south. In the lead group was the very recognizable and distinctive ruffled dorsal fin of J-1 Ruffles, who was surrounded by 10-12 of his family clan, including his mom J-2 Granny. We watched them for awhile as they made slow, lazy surfacings with an occasional tailslap. Then we moved to watch the back group of whales which included J-22 Oreo, her two youngsters (Double Stuff and Cookie), as well as J27 Blackberry. This group was a bit more boisterous, with Blackberry pushing Doublestuff around on the surface a couple of times. Then J27 gave us a nice viewing of his belly as he swam upside down for a bit. The whales were spread out probably over 1 mile as they slowly made their way down the Strait.

Ideal conditions to spot quite a group of Pacific White Sided Dolphins kind of meandering around slowly, as if just taking a break. As we began moving parallel to the group, they decided that is was playtime and made a bee-line for our boat. It was amazing seeing these creatures darting around the bow of the boat, gliding along almost effortlessly. Then they'd let the wake catch up to them and would surf in the waves, only to shoot forward back to our bow. It was truly a humbling sight to see that they chose to interact with us for a few minutes, then they decided to go off elsewhere, so we continued on our way knowing we had just encountered a rare interaction. It was truly magical!

We did get a look at one that was a much lighter color then any Gray I've seen before. Maybe it was the lighting, but I don't think so.

Two <b>gray whales</b> currently (<b>7:15 PM</b>) feeding in the shallows off Mabana Rd (SW Camano Isl). We just got back on Camano after being gone for several days, and our neighbors told us that last night about the same time, several grays were feeding in the shallows in front of the house, also several nights prior.

A friend of ours had stayed the night in his boat there and his Uncle was with him. His Uncle told us he was up late and heard a [<b>gray</b>] whale feeding nearby for a long time. He said it sounded very large. He could hear the blow sounds and the feeding sounds. Anyway, that was late into the night right next to the Langley Marina.
<br/>Lynda Imburgia, Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
Just a quick report that I heard a few <b>transient </b>calls between about <b>11:50 and midnight</b> PDT on OrcaSound. The first couple were very loud and squawky -- at first I thought it was a great blue heron getting surprised and eaten by something! The subsequent calls were spaced a few minutes apart, rapidly grew fainter, and sounded like transient calls.

Heard a <b>Gray </b>feeding and blowing tonight at <b>9:30 pm</b> near the shore off Edgecliff, just west of Sandy Point.
<br/>Gail Fleming, Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:30 PM</b> - Saw large <b>gray </b>whale off of Langley 100 yards out traveling SE. Later - 6:30 pm, walking along the Langley waterfront we saw what appeared to be mother and child off of the Camano Island side.
<br/>Wayne &amp; Linda Furber 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>5:30 PM</b> a <b>gray </b>whale swam by from northwest to the southeast past NW Langley. The tide was still pretty far out and the whale was just past the drop off doing deep dives and showing its fluke. The whale stopped in front of Langley at about 5:45 and in fifteen minutes it had sky hopped three times! That's the first time I'd seen a whale spy hop- it was wonderful. Of course I did not have my camera, by the time I had it the whale was headed to the SE (6:05 PM), I got one shot of its back and I think it is whale # 723.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden, Langley 
<br/>*<br/>
We were on the 1 pm Mukilteo/Clinton ferry, and saw a whale watch boat and two spouts off Camano Head from about <b>1-1:15 pm</b>. We drove over to Sandy Pt. south of Langley, to discover the two [<b>gray</b>] whales (and the boat, giving the whales lots of room) had moved south and were off the west side of Hat/Gedney Island. They were feeding VERY close to the shoreline! We watched them from 1:40 - 1:50 pm, they seemed to be slowly heading south as they fed.
<br/>Susan Berta and Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
We have had two <b>greys </b>off our beach on Edgecliff Drive, Langley, just west of Sandy Point for about 90 minutes (<b>8-8:30 am</b>) at this writing. Appears to be a female with a youngster. 
<br/>Dan Prewitt, Edgecliff Drive, Langley
<br/><i>Note - according to Cascadia Research, the local whales that feed in Saratoga Passage tend to be adult males rather than females with calves. However, one of the whales is smaller, and is often mistaken for a calf -sb</i>
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>3:45 pm</b> I spotted what looked like a <b>minke </b>heading north bout 1/4 mile south of Point Wells (near Edmonds). It was about 1/4 mile off the beach. I saw it surface twice so got a pretty good look at it thru the glasses.
<br/>Dan Leyde, Richmond Beach 
<br/>*<br/>
I believe I saw a <b>Minke </b>whale. I saw the rear portion with the small dorsal fin as it rose out of the water. It was much smaller than an orca or a gray whale. Black or dark gray. I saw it just north of Rolling Bay on Bainbridge Island, and just south of Faye Bainbridge State Park. It was about 150 yards off-shore, travling north along the shoreline at <b>11:15 am</b>.

This was an amazing evening for <b>gray whales!</b> I thought they had finished feeding here NW of Langley but, at about <b>5:30 PM</b> we heard a whale breathe and then accompanying splashing of a whale close into shore feeding. Sure enough it was Patch. He stayed for almost an hour and then suddenly took off very fast to the southeast. He was shallow and literally left a wake. We watched him head out to deeper water toward Camano Head and then at <b>6:30 PM</b> we saw another whale blow off in the distance. The two whales met almost mid channel between Langley and Camano Island. They spent about 15- 20 minutes sort of milling about. At 6:50 they began to head back to the NW and 7:00 PM both whales were feeding side by side NW of Langley. They continued to work their way to the NW feeding and then swimming out to deeper water, then back in to feed. We thought they had left but at 8:30 PM they were back NW of Langley. At 9:45 PM they were still here feeding. It was wonderful to see them again!

A repeat performance of the day before, a large <b>Gray </b>was feeding close to shore at <b>6:30 am</b> just north of Kayak point, moving north toward Warm Beach (Port Susan). Don't know ID's but saw two brushstroke-like markings on either the top of left fluke or bottom of right fluke.

Another report of <b>T20 </b>and (apparently) T21 -- same place (Eastern entrance to Sooke Basin) , close to the same time, in fact 50 hours later. Animals were almost exactly on top of the point where I had marked them on May 05. Time of sighting was <b>15:42</b> and seas were 6ft.-plus at in a roaring flood current.

Around <b>6:00 p.m</b> I looked out and saw a lone (<b>gray</b>) whale outside my window feeding in front of my house. I am on Witter Beach (SE Whidbey) and face directly east toward Hat Island and Everett. He hung around for quite awhile making his way south.

Orca Network received a call from Cheryl Uberman of <b>California</b>, she observed one male <b>orca </b>from the Timber Cove Inn, 90 miles north of San Francisco. It was several hundred yards offshore, possibly hunting, at <b>8:30 pm</b>, then it headed out to sea. 
<br/>*<br/>
Derek Whitmarsh of Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island, called Orca Network to report 2 <b>gray whales</b> heading south, closer to the Camano side of Saratoga Passage, at <b>3:35 pm</b>.

Orca Network received a call this morning from Chris Peterson, reporting a sighting of <b>orcas </b> off the N. end of Texada Island, B.C Gulf Islands. There were at least 3 orcas, near Rebecca Rock, observed from <b>11-11:30 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1204 hr - 1300hr</b>. Bull orca T20 and (another T?) spotted in 3 ft. seas (4 ft. and building by the time we left the animals) approx. 2 NM offshore of Sooke Bluffs (Eastern entrance to Sooke Basin) at <b>1204hr</b>. Current was a strong flood at Race Rocks but, further west and offshore, there was still a river of ebb current that the Westbound Transients sought out and rode West (of course dragging us into more exciting seas as time wore on). Left the animals near 1300hr approaching Otter Pt., still 2 plus NM offshore. Behaviour: 3-4 min dives between 3-4 minute "surfacings" (time near surface). No apparent hunting; animals traveling 4-6 Kn. (S.O.G).

I just received a few more pictures and details about last Saturday's orca sighting in Newport.
<br/>Jim Rice, Newport OR: Last Saturday I stepped out on to our balcony and saw a big dorsal fin then a couple more. I counted 5 total. One big, three medium and one smaller. They were circling and splashing in the area shown in the photos (see above). We could hear them blow as they came up. I did not see the seals, but one man said that there were a couple of seals in the middle of them. There were 3 other seals that were up hiding up on the rocks on shore. We took the 3 pics from the balcony. I headed down to get pics close up, but by the time I got there the orcas were headed back out toward the ocean.
<br/>Allan Best, Newport, OR
<br/>*<br/>
There was a report by at least 3-5 people that on opening day of shrimping season they saw a <b>killer whale</b> eating a sea lion just north of Ayock Beach. It happened about <b>8:45</b>. I did not see it. 
<br/>Elaine M. Wiley, Gypsy Cove, Hood Canal, WA
<br/>*<br/>
We received several photos of the Orcas reported Saturday morning in the Yaquina River, <b>Newport OR</b>, along with an additional report (which leaves no doubt that they were <b>Transients</b>!). 
<br/>
From Jim Rice: I've received this additional piece of information about Saturday's orca sighting: "I was out at S. Jetty this evening and ran into a young man walking the road who saw the orcas kill at least one harbor seal this morning. He lives near the start of the S. Jetty road. He thought there were 5 orcas, and they killed the seal on the south side between the bridge and the finger jetty. Barry"

<i>Orca Network shared Angi's photos (which weren't great ID shots, but one had some saddle patches) with researchers, and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research replied:
I will go way, way out on a limb here and take a GUESS that this MIGHT be T49C and T50. The fin shape is right and I think I can believe that I see nicks where they should be. I believe both of those whales have been photographed down that direction before too. Other than that, I can't say for sure!

We observed single <b>gray whale</b> pass through Mariner's Cove (near Strawberry Point) and feed very close along the shoreline at <b>7PM </b>Saturday evening. A lot of swirling around with flippers exposed for 15/20 minutes before heading south towards Polnell Point.
<br/>Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
Our first whale sighting began at <b>12:12</b> - The small/juvenile <b>Humpback </b>NE of Possession Pt. (N 47' 54.195 W 122' 21.995). The whale was traveling south bound, taking two to three breaths before diving. The sighting ended at 12:27, the whale did not fluke. Our next sighting began at <b>13:07</b> - 2 <b>grays </b>moving SSW of the dolphin day marker E of Gedney Island (N 48'00.268 W 122'15.863). Then a third Gray whale spotted at 13:15. All three whales were foraging in the shallows, with pectorals and flukes out of the water. One whale was #49. We left the whales at 13:35

Orca Network received a call from Dave Metz of <b>Newport, OR</b> at <b>10:10 am</b>, he was observing 3 <b>orcas </b>swimming up the Yaquina River in Newport. They went 200-300 yards upriver, nearly to the Newport Bridge, then turned &amp; were starting to swim back down river. He referred Angie to us, who was nearby watching the orcas - she first saw the orcas at 10:00 am as she was driving over the Newport bridge. She followed them along the jetty and took some photos which she will send to us.
It is likely these are <b>Transient </b>orcas looking for a seal or two.
