Whales everywhere today!! We started off with part of <b>J pod near Pender Island</b>....it was so nice to see those familiar fins again. I hope there is lots of food for them and they hang around a while. They were cruising up boundary when we got the report of the<b> T65As in the Strait of Georgia </b>so we headed out to them.......they are starting to feel like residents!! T65A5 was being a little superstar as usual. THEN....we got a report of <b>Humpbacks near Thrasher rock </b>so we went up there are found "<b>Big Momma</b>" with a new calf!!! They were slowly heading west up towards Entrance Island. WHAT A DAY!!! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J Pod</b> has 25 members. They split up into groups and were spread out for miles. Capt Carl chose to spend quality time with one group rather than trying to catch all of them. We were with the<b> J22 matriline consisting of J22 Oreo, J34 Doublestuf (the big male), J38 Cookie and J32 Rhapsody </b>who swims with them. I have a very different experience with Residents vs Transients. The Residents are so desperately endangered that they really tug at me and I find tears in my eyes every time I see them. Today was no different. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

OH MY GOSH! I am going through some of my J Pod photos from the Lighthouse early this morning. I have <b>so many shots of orcas with salmon in their mouths!</b> I had no idea until getting them on the computer! WOW! All I care about is that they are getting enough to eat. Apparently there was something out there this morning! - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:09pm - Faint S4 (SRKW) calls</b> are once again audible on the<b> Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. - Meg McDonald
<b>J14 Samish in Haro Strait </b>this morning. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Last Day Of May:<b> J-Pod!! </b> <b>2:54pm - J-Pod</b> was super, super spread out. At <b>9:00 AM</b> I saw the <b>J16s from Lime Kiln</b>. Out with Maya's Westside Whale Charters later in the morning we met up with the <b>J14s, J19s, J2, and L87 </b>near Turn Point. Sure is good to have them "home"! - Monika Wieland

More whales up north today!! It's been an incredible season so far<b> around the Nanaimo area for Biggs</b>. We had a group today I have never seen before, the <b>T77's</b> around neck point heading west. The were just slowly cruising for the encounter but it's just amazing to see them, especially new ones for me. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

The Orca streak continues!! <b>T65A's today in the Vancouver harbour</b>. We started heading out towards a report near Crofton and got a call about whales near Vancouver so we turned around and were lucky enough to pick them up. They were just traveling for the most part but did make one seal kill. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Depoe Bay Oregon Ranger Renee Fowler called this morning to report seeing <b>four orcas heading north past Depoe Bay at 10:15, including one adult male</b>.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

We had the<b> T049A's and the T065A's in the morning</b> on<b> Hein Bank</b> followed by <b>T097 and T093</b>. They all ended up going north up <b>Haro Strait</b>.  The T049A's and T065A's followed close to the shoreline while T093 and T097 lagged behind and offshore. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Two new transient orcas</b> were reported in Canadian waters <b>near Darcy Island</b>. Once on scene, our transient expert Mark was able to identify them as <b>T93 and T97</b>, a pair of males who are often seen traveling as a pair. The trips had time to return to the original<b> group of 12 transients</b>! Our afternoon was with the two "twin" males near Sidney and the larger group still traveling north towards Turn Point. The larger group, although difficult to identify exactly which individuals were there, were believed to be 3 different families together. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Great day out on the water today! Spent the day watching <b>three groups of transients off San Juan Island/ Salmon Bank</b>. I was able to ID the<b> T049As, T065As, T093, and T097</b>. Lots of high speed porpoising. T051, T049A2, and T049A1 off Discovery Island. - Josh McInnes
Transients T049As, T065As, T093 and T097.

Encounter #17
<br/>Enc Start time:05:20 PM - Enc End Time:07:30 PM
<br/>Vessel: Orca
<br/>Observers: Dave Ellifrit
<br/>Pods or ecotype: <b>T49As,T65As</b>
<br/>List individuals present (Orca ID's):  <b>T49A,T49A1,T49A3,T49A4,T65A,T65A2, T65A3,T65A4, and T65A5</b>
<br/>Location:<b> Boundary Pass</b>
<br/>Encounter Summary: Dave Ellifrit was on the mainland running errands when Ken Balcomb called him from Sooke to report that Ivan Reiff had spotted transients from Cattle Point that morning and that they were now headed up the west side of San Juan Island. Dave got back on SJI around 1600 and soon got updates on the whales from Jeanne Hyde who were now in Boundary Pass. Dave jumped in Orca and, with the help of Jeff LaMarsh on Goldwing, got on scene in Boundary Pass at 1720 about two miles north of John's Pass. The T49As and T65As were pointed east with the T65As being a couple of hundred yards in front of the T49As. The two groups joined back up around 1742 and continued traveling, sometimes changing directions from east to north but generally heading toward the northwest side of Waldron Island. Around 1805, T49A, T49A3, and T49A4 split off from the others and slinked off to forage in the middle of Boundary Pass while T49A1 stuck with the T65As and continued toward the Waldron shoreline. Around 1830, Orca left the larger group to go look for the break away three only to miss T49A1 and the T65As kill a seal ( observed by the people on the boat Loki ) just on the inside of Fishery Point on Waldron Island. While the kill was happening, T49A, T49A3, and T49A4 quit their foraging and came hurrying back to join the others feeding on the kill. There was some post kill celebration as the whales fed-mainly from T65A4 who breached and spy hopped several times. The whales soon began heading north again, past Skipjack Island. T49A1 and T65A2 moved off together about a quarter mile east of the others and Orca ended the encounter at 1930 with the whales still heading north about three quarters of a mile north of Skipjack Island.

Ken Balcomb spotted <b>11 T's from shore  inside Secretary island in the afternoon</b>.  I waited until they got east of Trial Island in the evening before going out to confirm ID's. They were the <b>T049A's, T065A's, T051 and T091</b>. - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T124A </b>sporting some shiny new gouges around her eye! - Andy Scheffler

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The perils of hunting food that fights back. Either<b> TO124A or TO90 off Moresby Island BC </b>Saturday. If you open it large you can see a strip of skin has been peeled back and is hanging over her eye. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

BC Ferries reported that there was <b>a group of whales right in the middle of Active Pass, 5 transient orcas</b>! The group were later identified as <b>T124A's and T90's</b>.  - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw <b>4 or 5 whales go by our place at Otter Point just after 1:30 </b>today. - Sharon Orr

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

(Previously reported as a humpback until looking at the photos) So exciting, about <b>7:30 - 8:30 Chito Beach Resort</b> (just east of Shipwreck Point, about 15 miles east of Neah Bay) got our first sighting of a [<b>gray whale</b>]. Stayed right in front of the resort for about an hour. Rolling around, tail up flukes up, bubbles rising. - Amy Cramer

<br/><br/>

The <b>T90s and T101s</b> traveling in a tight group <b>NW past Qualicum Beach</b>, Vancouver Island (furthest point north i've been on a tour so far). <b>T87</b> was also in attendance, but was traveling separate from the group (more than a mile away). - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T49S. Race Rocks</b>. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The furthest north I've ever gone today!! We chased a report all the way up to <b>Qualicum Beach area before spotting the T90's, T101's and T87</b>. They had just made a kill when we first spotted them and celebrated with some breaches and tail slaps. They tightened up into a resting formation after and cruised west. It was such a beautiful day and amazing lighting to see them. Here are few shots of the 90's and 101's. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I believe I saw <b>a humpback this morning 9am off of Sunset Marina in West Vancouver</b>.... Alone heading north up Howe Sound. - Lori Payne  

<br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

Wow what a day! Great encounter with Bigg's Killer Whales. After we got on scene with the whales a second family of Orcas showed up. <b>Between Nanaimo and Parksville with the T086A's and some of the T124's and T124A's.</b> - Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I just love seeing this whale, <b>T124A1</b>. She's a good reminder of how mysterious these animals are. She's often seen separated from her matriline and swimming with other groups. It is pretty rare for them to be swimming with no family members. We saw her a few weeks ago swimming with her mom and siblings and now she's off on her own again swimming today with the <b>86A's</b>......such an awesome whale! -  Gary Sutton

<br/><br/>

Sent in by Edith Hitchings, the sister of the reporting party.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Matt Hill called to say he saw <b>four orcas on the "Garbage Dump" (Koitlah Point) off Neah Bay and Tatoosh Island, just outside the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. There were two females, one adult male and a juvenile, heading NW toward the outer coast of Vancouver Island.

<b>May 22 &amp; 28</b>
<br/>I was recently catching up on some e-mails and came across the Orca Network report [with the gray whale photographed May 22 by Stu Davidson and Janine Harles off Edmonds]. I couldn't help but recognize the little grey whale that was photographed in Puget Sound on May 22nd as the same individual that <b>I photographed on May 28th off northeast Vancouver Island</b> while out doing some work with MERS. The pigment on the right side of the head and the left flank match up nicely. Anyway, it was so covered in KW teeth rakes scars that we decided to Facebook an image of it. Thought you all might be interested. - Jared Towers

<br/><br/>

Fun seeing <b>a Gray Whale </b>slowly making his way around Puget Sound today!! From <b>Edmonds</b> looking northwesterly over Puget Sound with south end of Whidbey Island in the background. - Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:10 - a Gray Whale  only about 200' off the beach </b>trolling between <b>ocean ave and picnic point</b>... east of midchannel, near the Edmonds ferry dock.
<br/><b>2:06 - </b>He's turned...heading east towards <b>shipwreck</b>...still trending north....
<br/><b>Noon - a gray whale</b> about 200' off shore of<b> Edmonds' Marina Beach</b>, heading north. - Janine Harles

<b>T100's T124's and T124a's, Nanaimo area</b>. Sweet afternoon! I received a tip of killer whales 3 hours into our tour. We extended the tour and got to see <b>12 Bigg's Killer Whales in False Narrows </b>this afternoon. We found them just north of Dodd's Narrows heading into False Pass where they hunted seals and socialized for 45 minutes. Another great day in the Salish Sea! - Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:21 - Whale</b> spotted earlier mile <b>north of Edmonds ferry terminal </b>turned and is slowly heading north.. Probably out from talbot by now.. Not too far off from shore (east side). Got some puff shots.
<br/><b>7:30pm -</b> Whale! Perfect timing! My wife (Jackie) spotted a "puff" out in the Sound while we were making dinner. Watched "him" playing around out from our place..(a dozen or more puffs) heading south one minute, then turned and slowly started north towards Mukilteo following the tide convergence. Photo taken from <b>Edmonds</b>, looking west over the Puget Sound, Kitsap /Kingston in the background. - Stu Davidson Photography

A large <b>humpback whale</b> graced us with its presence on the <b>American side of the Juan de Fuca Strait</b>. Captain Scott aboard the Ocean Magic II believed that the large male was "Split Fin", who was travelling solo just<b> 2 nautical miles off Crescent Bay</b>. He noted that when they shut the engines off completely, they could hear the whale breathing as it slowly surfaced time and again! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>7:10 am -</b> Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries called to relay a report from a ferry captain of <b>two gray whales heading south in Rosario Strait</b>.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 15</font></b></center>
<br/>

We had a bit of an exciting occurrence here in the islands - we encountered <b>three transient orcas</b> that have possibly not been seen in our neck of the woods before - <b>T139, T141 and her calf</b>. They were traveling with the <b>T18</b> group (which is frequently sighted here). T139 is estimated to have been born in 1978 and T141 in 1985. According to the "Transients" book by Ford and Ellis: "This group, encountered on only a few occasions in British Columbia, is very poorly known." Of course this book was written quite a number of year ago, but still enchanted to encounter some exotic transients. - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T139, T141</b>, and a small juvenile that was not T141A (maybe T141B-I'll check with Jared) that were with <b>T18 and the T19s today in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass</b>.  This was their first visit to this area to my knowledge.  - Dave Ellifrit

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Today we had some new <b>Bigg's Killer Whales visit the Salish Sea</b>. We got to spend some time with them in <b>Haro Strait</b>. There were <b>seven animals</b> traveling together spread out over a few miles. One of the families were the <b>T018's</b> who we see fairly regularly in our waters. The other three whales traveling with the T018's were<b> T140, T141 and I believe T141B</b>. This is the first time I have seen these whales and apparently this is the first time they have been recorded in the Salish Sea. They tend to spend their time on the Central Coast. Beautiful morning on the water. - Simon Pidcock, Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:47 pm - T097 and T093 off Constance Bank</b>. I got the report of them off Constance Bank traveling NE towards Trial Island off Victoria BC. - Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Bret Greenheck of<b> Yaquina Head Park, Oregon</b>, reported seeing<b> two adult male orcas around 5 pm</b> approx. .5 mile from shore off the headland, milling around Seal Rock for several minutes, then heading west around the headlands. He went to a higher viewpoint to try to find their direction of travel but could not re-locate them. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Stan Crupen - sport fisherman, called to say he saw <b>about 6 orcas, including two adult males</b>, in water 350' deep just off <b>Bodega Bay CA</b>.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 14</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>1:00PM -</b> West Coast Catch Shares Ground Fish fishery observer spotted <b>a pod of killer whales</b> circling the vessel at 40° 28.27 N, 124° 34.72 W (<b>north of Cape Mendocino CA</b>). The pod appeared to be comprised of <b>3-4 females and one large male</b>. After an hour of the whales circling the vessel they continued North. Approximately 1-2 miles away the whales were observed extensively breaching. -M. Winscher
<br/><i>Alisa Shulman-Janiger has ID'd the male as CA94, Transient-type mammal-eater, never associated with other known transients. This is only his THIRD sighting! The first was in 1990 - off of Santa Catalina Island.</i>
<br/>This is an amazing sighting of a very distinctive male! He was with two very distinctive females (as well as several juveniles) during his previous two sightings. I did not see those females in any of the images that JC sent to me. One female suffered some sort of injury between 1990 and 2008, and lost over half of her dorsal fin! - Alisa Shulman-Janiger

<b>Transients in Dungeness Bay</b>. Lat/Long: 48.177305/-123.106613. I'm a volunteer lighthouse keeper at the New Dungeness Lighthouse on the spit at <b>Sequim</b>. There are <b>several orcas in the bay</b>, unfortunately being harassed by a sailboat who is chasing the pod around the bay as they try to feed on the abundant seal population here. I'm having trouble getting a clear count, with the sailboat constantly breaking up the pod, but there appears to be at least <b>4 adults and one youngster</b>. Initially they were feeding with some playing (tail lobs, juvenile spy-hopping). Once the boat began harassing them, they seemed to primarily be trying to avoid the boat, essentially until the boat chased them out of the bay. - Sarah Miller

After yesterday's exciting discovery that resident orcas were back in the area, we had our fingers crossed we would find them again today- and we did, <b>heading west in Juan de Fuca Strait off of Point-no-Point</b>, which is the farthest west we can travel in a 3 hour trip from Victoria. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

I received a call from a buddy on the ferry that he saw <b>killer whales entering Active Pass at 1145</b>. Mike on Sealion was able to locate them and confirmed <b>Jpod spread out offshore Mayne Island heading south east towards East Point</b>. With the power outage on San Juan Island between 12:00 am and 7:00 am they were able to make their way north up Haro and Swanson Straits  in the early morning without being detected on the S.J.I.  hydrophones. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<b>6:22 - J pod heading south in Boundary Pass</b>, approaching Turn Point.
<br/>3:30 - Ken Balcomb reports <b>J pod is in southern Georgia Strait</b>, heading south, spread out and hopefully finding some scattered Chinook heading for the Fraser River.
<br/><i>As noted in the previous Orca Network Sightings Report, J26 Mike (presumably with the rest of J pod) was photographed off the Russian River, about 50 miles north of San Francisco, at 1130 on May 1. As noted by Meg McDonald, <b>J pod traveled over 850 miles in 8 or fewer days </b>to get from Bodega Bay (Russian River) on May 1 to the San Juan Island area today, where they were reported at 6 am this morning. That doesn't give them much time to eat or rest.</i>

Saw another <b>orca pod</b> today. Sighting was at <b>38.40 (latitude, just south of Sonoma State Park, California</b>) less than a mile off the beach.

Jon (Scordino) got a call this morning at <b>~8:45 reporting a large group of killer whales (at least 20) heading east past Neah Bay</b>.

<b>Killer whales spotted off Morro Bay,</b> Calif. It's a rare sight: Killer Whales passing near the shores of the Central Coast. It happened today in Morro Bay. "It looks like the Killer Whales might be either attacking or taking down one of the gray whales." said Becka Kelly, Harbor Patrol supervisor in Morro Bay. "Ive never seen this before in this area." she said. "We've seen Killer Whales come through, but I've never seen any live action like this." - Jeanette Trompeter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had a pod, Minimum <b>7 possibly 9 or more 1 mile west of Morro Bay</b>.

First joint report from Gary and Tasli! What a day!! A<b> huge group of T's</b> reported early in the morning in<b> Sansum Narrows</b> so off we went to find them. We caught up with them around <b>Crofton </b>and they were really moving! 8 knots against the tide. We had the <b>T90's, T100's (minus the 100B's</b>), <b>T101's, T124's and T87</b>. They slowed down for a while near <b>Kuper island</b> (northern Gulf Islands) and did some spy hopping and then continued moving up towards Thetis Island. We hadn't seen <b>T101C</b> for most of the trip and was starting to get worried but then, out of nowhere, there he was with <b>T124E</b> porpoising right passed our boat to catch up with the others! We have attached some pictures. The first one is <b>T124E</b> porpoising by the boat and the other is <b>T101C</b> following suit (Photos by Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver). The next shot is a spy hop from <b>T101</b> and I've sent another photo in a separate email with the two brothers, <b>T101B and T102</b> because the files are too big for one email (Photos by Tasli Shaw, Steveston Seabreeze Adventures). - Gary Sutton &amp; Tasli Shaw

Today a "superpod" of Ts! <b>T90s, T100s (minus 100Bs), T101s, T124s, and T87</b>. A real treat to watch whales in the northern Gulf Islands. Always one of the highlights of my season. - Tasli Shaw

I was able to find a large group of <b>T's at the mouth of Cowichan Bay</b> in the morning thanks to a report from Simon of Ecoventures. <b>T100C in Sansum Narrows</b>. They went north into <b>Sansum Narrows</b> where they met up with a south bound group. They eventually turned back north. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Mark and Rush booted it up to <b>Sansun Narrows</b> where a couple groups of <b>transient killer whales</b> had been reported. What they found was spectacular. <b>Two groups of killer whales</b>, joined together zig-zagging through the channel, initially going south, switched direction and travelled north along Saltspring Island. Mark said they were breaching and conducting lots of surface behaviours, even vocalizing at the surface! - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

<b>Patch (#49) </b>made an appearance east of <b>Hat Island at 12:25 pm</b>, while at 1<b>:10 pm #723 </b>had passengers on Mystic Sea holding their breath as he traversed the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry dock in sight of the approaching ferry...

Awesome day on the water with social Bigg's! The <b>T65As</b> in the <b>Gulf of Georgia</b> in flat calm conditions. This family of five is quite the joy to witness, they often appear boisterous at the surface (before, after, and especially during meal time). Today was no exception! They had made a sea lion kill earlier in the day and were carrying pieces of the carcass around, with the youngest, <b>T65A5</b> (first seen this March) making excited bursts of speed around his/her siblings as they pushed and dragged pieces of the sea lion around. Mom (<b>T65A</b>) was ever so cool and lead her family west at a slow and leisurely pace, allowing her 4 children to dawdle along and socialize with one another. - Tasli Shaw

Spotted <b>a single Orca on Saturday around 6:30 p.m.</b> in the bay by Ferry Road Park (near the North Bend "McCullough" Bridge") in<b> North Bend, Oregon</b>. Traveling, perhaps scouting, was by itself. He surfaced four or five times after I first spotted him and then headed out back under the bridge. I think it's about five miles or so from where I saw him to where he had to have come in at in Charleston. Pretty amazing. - Morgan Gaines
