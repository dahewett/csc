<h3><center>June 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>late June</b>
<br/><br/>
The breaching whale in the photos (see photo of the day, above) jumped out of the water right next to the boat 3x in a row!! The engine was off and we had been sitting there (Soundwatch was near by observing...) and the whales changed direction sneakily under water and re-appeared with the breaches beside the boat. Absolutely shocking to us all since the last few minutes before that they had been going in the totally opposite direction!! I'll never forget that moment!! As soon as that breach occurred, all the whales began surfacing beside the boat!!! The whales were HUGE up close!!! :) Completely unbelievable!!!

The water looked like glass tonight as we headed out of Friday Harbor in search of the Orcas. Earlier on the afternoon trip we observed 
<b>K pod</b> just outside of Cattle pass slowly traveling north on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> but this evening there were new reports of [<b>orcas</b>] even closer by. We quickly caught up to them as they traveled along <b>Stuart Island</b>. After only a moment of observing this pod I saw that familiar wavy dorsal fin pop up and knew we were in the presence of J-pod. 'Ruffles' one of the adult males has an unmistakable wavy trailing edge to his dorsal fin. The whales traveled along slowly in a tight knit group but a quick glance ahead revealed that there were more whales to be seen. After reaching turn point (the most northwestern point in the United States) they became a little more active and we were lucky enough to see several breaches, tail lobbing and a cartwheel or two before heading back home.

<br/>Suzy Roebling, Florida
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcasound hydrophone</b> - Val's software detected a couple calls about an hour ago (<b>1250 </b>pm), including S1 and S4, implying J pod may be around.
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson called at <b>1:10 pm</b> to report <b>L pod</b> off the SW side of <b>San Juan Island</b>
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report <b>L pod</b> off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. They first were heading north to Edwards Pt. at <b>8:30 am,</b> then turned and headed south, then north, then south again (the West side shuffle)! He IDd L12, L845 &amp; L41. 
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson called to relay a report from Mark Malleson of a large pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> off <b>Victoria, B.C,</b> at <b>8 am</b> heading SE toward Admiralty Inlet at a fast speed.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4.45 pm</b> - about a dozen <b>Harbor porpoise</b> milling and 'porpoising' off <b>Ft Casey</b>.

<br/><br/>
We were on our way today to see the residents along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. In the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, we ran into about <b>100 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b>. They put on an amazing show, riding our wake and breaching. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver 
<br/>*<br/>
Warren Peterson of <b>Quadra Island, B.C.</b> called at <b>8:20 pm</b> to say there were six <b>orcas </b>including one male, heading north toward Seymour Narrows, across from Campbell River.

We were boating on the west side of<b> North Pender Island BC</b> at <b>6:45 p.m.</b> and observed <b>15+ orcas </b>heading towards <b>Active Pass</b>. Observed 5 or 6 breaches!
<br/>Nancy Lee Westrell (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
We headed north towards <b>S. Pender Island</b>. We said goodbye to the U.S. and hello to the <b>orca </b>whales! We spotted at least five orca whales that were most likely from the <b>J-pod</b> because J1 "Ruffles" was traveling near by. They were tail slapping and cartwheeling all over the place!

<br/><br/>
<b>1:30 pm.</b> Whales were seen offshore from <b>False Bay</b> in the <b>morning</b>. They were spread out and foraging. By noon they moved up island. There were many conflicting reports as to who was present. The following whales were ID'd as they passed by Lime Kiln Lighthouse in the afternoon: <b>J1,J2,J8, J19, J41, the J-16s family group, the J-14s family group, L12, L85, L22, L79 and L89</b>.

Erick Peirson reported <b>Orcas </b>off <b>False Bay, SW San Juan Island</b>, milling at <b>10:20 am</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Today was filled with sightings of marine birds, several bald eagles, harbor seals, and killer whales. By the time we rounded the north end of <b>San Juan Island</b>, our guests had learned about the connections between the nutrient rich waters, fish, marine mammals, and humans. There we saw <b>J-1 &amp; J-2</b>, slowly leading several groups of J's along with <b>some L's and K's</b>, north along the west side of San Juan Island. At Mosquito Pass many of the younger whales breached several times! The orcas showed us a bit of their culture and lifelong family ties.

<br/><br/>
After watching whales pass the house (Center for Whale Research) Ken Balcomb, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken departed from snug and immediately encountered whales off <b>Kellet Bluff</b> (48° 59.378 N; 123° 20.358 W) at <b>6:03 p.m</b>. We saw several groups of<b> L-pod</b> whales engaging in very social behavior. During the evening we saw L26, L90, L92, L95, L72, L105, L55, L86, L106, L27, L82, L103, L109, L47, L83, L110 and L91. Finally we finished our encounter north of Turn Point (48° 70.798 N; 123° 24.364 W) at 8:03 p.m. with the L12s and a few spectacular breaches from a couple of the males.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, SanJuan Island
<br/>*<br/>
As a volunteer at <b>Lime Kiln</b>, I was down at the whale watching area (rock wall) explaining to the tourists who they were looking at -- some of <b>L pod</b> were in very, very close to the rocks giving a great show. At one point a male just floats on the surface, keeping himself in one place, looking. Then all of a sudden he raised his head and let out two calls, splashed his tail still floating in place and then sunk straight down under again. Everyone at the observation point heard those calls. Very cool and my first time hearing calls in the open air, not via the hydrophones!
<br/>Dennis Linden, WSU Beach Watcher SJI, Lime Kiln Interpretive Center
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30 pm.</b> The <b>L-12s</b> came in late on Saturday night, but little did I know many other L pod whales would show up on the west side Sunday afternoon. When they passed by at <b>Lime Kiln Pt. State Park</b>, members of the <b>L4s, L26s, L21s, L12s</b> (10 of them - not L87 he travels with K pod), L7s and L43s, were seen. More of the story and pictures on my blog.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
As I was awaiting for what I thought would be their return from the Fraser River heading south some of <b>K pod</b> approached <b>Pt. Roberts</b> Lighthouse Marine Park heading north. Wow! they spent over 12 hours in this critical habitat. My previously recorded maximum time was seven hours. The first orca seen was Raggedy "<b>K40</b>". She and others were moving slow. There were groups of three and four doing some foraging. A male did a speed turn to get a salmon right off the dock pilings that is a favourite spot for them to grab a fish or two. One orca logged close to shore for about 4 minutes. They like it here when it is quiet. Four seals grouped together and came close to shore but didn't have to worry about these residents since only transients may eat them. A few hours later reports were that these one were at the South Arm of the Fraser River while there was another group at the North Arm.
I had expected that some would be passing Point Roberts later but hopes were fading when it looked like they were heading to Active Pass to head back to San Juan Islands. However, this large group of Js and some Ks turned to head north to the Tsawwassen Coal Docks. So is this going to be a return to the Fraser River? Nope they decided to follow the orcas that I was photographing who were off already off the park heading south. It looked like "Granny" J2 was in this group (I still have to check all my ID photos). One baby did four consecutive breaches. 
About two hours later the second group with the Js and some Ks approached. One adult did a couple of lunges with the massive body completely out of the water. At the end two J babies starting breaching. Land based whale watchers were thrilled. Within 100 yards the orcas grouped up, tail slapped, and breached as the rain stopped and the sun lighted the adventures of both orcas and people. Nature can be predictable in that they will be unpredictable.
<br/>Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce Founding Director
<br/>*<br/>
There are some great <b>Orca </b>sounds, whistles etc and some echolocation clicks on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at this hour - <b>11.15pm</b> - still happening at <b>11.45pm</b>. Now it is the noise of a deep sea vessel. Deafening!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orca </b>on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophones</b> at <b>10:42 pm</b> and at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> (further S) at <b>11:49 pm</b>.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia
<br/>*<br/>
Tuned in to <b>Lime Kiln (hydrophones)</b> at <b>11:20 PM</b> to hear sounds I haven't heard before. Possibly transients? Chatter ended at <b>11:36</b>.

<b>Orcas </b>@ the <b>Lime Kiln</b> now - <b>4:53</b> (AND again at <b>5:59</b>)
<br/>Jaime Castro (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
From <b>Pender Island, B.C.</b>: <b>Tonight</b>, around <b>25 orcas</b> came by. We saw flukes &amp; 1 breach. It's a calm night &amp; we could hear their breaths before seeing them in front of the house. Some were close in, some were about 1/3 of the way across Swanson Channel towards Portland Island. After most had passed by, around 10-11 of them turned back &amp; went south again towards Thieves Bay. A wonderful evening, &amp; the icing on the cake was a flamboyant sunset.
<br/>Nancy Lee Westrell (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
We just came back from <b>Lime Kiln Point State Park</b> on San Juan Island, where a group of <b>Orcas </b>was passing by at around <b>5 p.m.</b>, heading north. It was amazing, they came really close to the rocks and some were breaching. 
<br/>Thomas Kleinteich
<br/>*<br/>
Was listening for whales all day on the hydrophone, when I heard a few quiet squeaks this afternoon and headed to the west side (<b>San Juan Isl</b>). We missed the main group that headed north, but the L12's were not far behind and VERY close to shore. Lots of breaches, and cartwheels! Amazing time! I'm guessing this was at <b>4pm </b>on Sunday.
<br/>Traci Walter, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J27, J28</b> and others including two calves, one of which was J46, at Point Grey today! We had 7 members of <b>J pod</b> who were trailing far behind the rest of the pod who was near the coal port. They were doing a lot of foraging followed by breaching and spyhops. Here is a picture of one of the calves and another picture of a spyhop.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson reported <b>J pod</b> and some <b>Ks </b>milling off <b>False Bay, San Juan Island</b> at <b>3:30 pm</b>, with some of <b>L pod</b> up at <b>Salmon Bank</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
The 12.15 pm Ocean Magic out of Victoria headed deep south toward Whidbey Island, where we found several members of<b> L pod</b>, that were slowly foraging in wide circles and then traveling leisurely north, one by one. <b>L 12</b>, Alexis, with her two nicks in her dorsal fin was identified as was <b>L 79</b> who surprised us on board with two enormous breaches. Two other males were seen off in the distance but not identified. Conditions were excellent for viewing today with no wind and flat calm water. An awesome encounter with Skana, L 79.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic. Prince of Whales, Victoria.BC
<br/>*<br/>
Rudy Deck of Whidbey Island called at <b>12:40 pm</b> to report the <b>orcas </b>off <b>NW Whidbey</b> were about 5 miles SW of Smith Island - he could just make out some fins and tails, and the Victoria Clipper passengers were getting a good look at them!
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson called to report <b>So. Resident Orcas</b> milling and foraging at <b>Partridge Bank</b>, from <b>10:30 - 11:30 am</b>, including <b>L41</b>.
<br/>*<br/> 
Bev Wenthin of Whidbey Island called to report seeing 2 either large <b>porpoise or small orcas</b> heading south off <b>Bush Pt</b>. at <b>12:45 pm</b>. They were black and white, but she didn't see spouts, and they looked a bit small for orcas, so possibly Dall's porpoise? 
<br/>*<br/>
The same [<b>orcas</b>] reported in Monterey the day before yesterday (6/25) were still here yesterday (6/26) and today (6/27), but it looks like they were with another pod as well this <b>afternoon</b>. They were pretty playful, and one male was showing off his "assets". 
<br/>Kate Cummings, Moss Landing, <b>Monterey Bay, CA</b>
<br/><i> re: Kate's photos: I was also there the last 3 days they have been here so have photos. These are the 122's. 
<br/>Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whale Watch
<br/>These are the whales that were tagged (2 of them) in April. They were the CA51s (5 whales) and the CA138s (three whales, including a young calf), as well as CA171's juvenile male. These same whales were photographed last Tuesday (6/22) afternoon around 1:30 pm off the Los Angeles area, headed north.

Greetings from <b>Sechelt Sunshine Coast BC</b>. June 25th had a <b>gray whale</b> off Davis Bay feeding around <b>5:00pm</b>. The lonely whale was spotted the night before at Gibsons also feeding along shore line and then on morning of 25th had moved further up coast to Mission Point where it was feeding close in, in kelp beds. Moved up to Davis Bay Sechelt and collected several hundred watchers along highway watching the whale in close. It proceeded further up coast and away from shore. Last seen heading to middle of straight. This morning (6/27) it was again seen off Roberts Creek on the Sunshine Coast feeding for about an hour. Lots of people saw the whale with cameras but we're sending this just in case. keep up the good work

Ken Balcomb, Astird van Ginneken, and Lisa Moorby encountered <b>J's and K's</b> off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> (48° 54.12 N; 123° 17.418 W) at <b>5:22 p.m</b>. The whales were in tight groups milling off San Juan County Park. The encounter ended a few miles north of Lime Kiln State Park (48° 53.107;123° 16.526 W) at 5:56 p.m.

<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call at <b>3:40 pm</b> from Mike Blair of the Kalaloch Lodge on the<b> WA Coast</b> - they have <b>4 female orcas</b> &amp; a calf in front of the lodge, milling for 15 minutes in the waves off the entrance to the creek. They saw them coming down from the north, presumably trending south.
<br/>*<br/>
It isn't often that we see a <b>Gray Whale</b> on our side of the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. This young animal has been hanging around <b>Oak Bay, Victoria</b> waterfront, Mary Todd Island and Willows Beach for a few days. Affectionately named 'Phantom ', since he doesn't show himself too often, but he is there. I saw him on Saturday June 26th at 1pm. He seemed to be foraging close to a channel marker in the Oak Bay vicinity.

Lately the <b>Orcas </b>have been cruising the west side of San Juan Island so when the reports came in today of whales over by <b>Lummi island</b> I was really excited. Whales and somewhere new to see! Lummi Island is located just off of Bellingham. We barely made it out of Friday Harbor before we encounter Dall's porpoise frolicking in the wake of boats passing by. The adorable black and white porpoise are often found riding the bow of boats. After a few glimpses of the tiny cetaceans we continued on in search of our larger black and white friends the Orca.
We all marveled at the gorgeous day and the wonderful view of Mt. Baker in the distance. Reaching Lummi Island the guests were delighted at the site of a towering dorsal fin gracefully sliding by. Just as reported earlier we were observing <b>J pod</b>. Members of the pod were widely spread and appeared to be casually traveling along. Moving further offshore we encountered the infamous <b>Ruffles and Granny</b>. The flat calm waters made it easy to see the saddle patches of the Orcas. The saddle patch is unique for each individual and is used in photo identification.

<b>Orcas </b>passed <b>Point Roberts Lighthouse Marine Park</b> in the <b>morning</b>. They were traveling south to Rosario Strait and it looked liked it would be down Rosario around Southern Lopez to Haro Strait. But in the early evening they turned and were pointed north. Now orcas have changed directions in this Strait previously but the time to show up at Point Roberts was somewhat unusual.

Ken Balcomb, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken of CWR encountered members of <b>J-pod</b> just a little South of Snug Harbor at <b>9:44 a.m.</b> (48° 50945 N;123° 14.934 W), and stayed with them down to eagle cove. They were spread out and slowly traveling north. We ended our encounter with a spectacular breach from J19, right back outside Snug Harbor, at 12:07 p.m. (48° 51.323 N; 123° 15.034 W).

I have also enclosed a picture of <b>J28 &amp; J46</b> near <b>False Bay</b>, at <b>3.10pm</b>. The Orcas were heading south when we left them, we had about 10 Orcas including <b>J28 &amp; J46, J14 &amp; J45, K21 &amp; K40</b>. We picked them up again in the evening just below <b>Lime Kiln</b> and followed them as they moved steadily south during the evening. Most of J-pod had earlier moved north.

A <b>Gray Whale</b> has been hanging around <b>Victoria </b>for the past few days. One of our Naturalists, Kristen Kanes, who was involved in Gray Whale Research &amp; I.D. last summer with UVIC has recognized this Gray Whale as one they nicknamed "2 dot Star". We first saw this particular Whale about a month ago near <b>Hein Bank</b> and the Whale has been seen around Victoria for almost a week now. We encountered him on June 25th just south of Great Chain at about <b>4.30pm</b>.

Who was Mr. <b>Ruffles </b>traveling with this afternoon? Around <b>5 pm</b>, about <b>8 orcas</b> were heading east through <b>Active Pass</b> on a bit of a tide. First a group of about 5, then a group of 3. Some tail slapping, body cartwheels, and a breach or two.

<br/>*<br/>
Softly we sat and watched the whales (<b>So. Residents</b>) about 700 yards away from us. At first we could only see white wake, their bodies like boats zooming through the water. As we waited, their dorsal fins began to loom in the distance. We followed them as they swam parallel to us west along the south side of <b>Stuart Island</b>, reuniting with their pod at Turn Point Light House. It was a slow but satiating afternoon as we watched the orcas loll about the land, hugging the shore. Bright, sunny, peaceful and with a bit of wind, when it was time to go, it felt like a dream one wasn't quite ready to let go of.

This morning started off wonderfully at about <b>6:00am</b> with flat seas and soft lighting on the west side. When I went outside I found members of <b>J Pod</b> resting on the water off of <b>Hannah Heights</b>. They were not really going anywhere- rarely diving and not a lot of activity. It was as if they too were enjoying the new found warmth in the air. They continued in this manner for the next 3 hours with very few vocalizations on the hydrophones, milling slowly towards Land Bank eventually grouping up rather nicely offshore. Languid seems to be the word of the morning!

We found a group of <b>five killer whales</b> today at 36'45.2 and 121'58.3. We were near sea lions as well as pacific white-sided dolphins and it was pretty obvious one of the two became their lunch. We could see slick on the water (probably the oil from whatever they killed) and gulls and albatross started picking bits off the surface where the whales were. Very exciting!

<br/><i>Here are IDs for most of the transient killer whales that Kate Cummings saw today in Monterey Bay: <b>CA122 (T164), CA122a, CA122b</b>, and a sprouting male (juv of <b>CA171</b>). This male was sighted off of Los Angeles Harbor on May 20, and off of Oxnard, CA on May 30. We may have had him again off Los Angeles Harbor on June 22; I will be receiving photos soon that will allow me to confirm this.

We headed out at <b>2pm </b>and our sunny day soon turned to dense fog as we reached Cattle Pass. We had reports of <b>J'pod and K21 &amp; K40</b> spread out on the West side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Captain Hobbes with JB's assistance navigated carefully to Eagle Point Area where we soon spotted J26 (Mike) a 19 yr old male and J16 (Slick) his 38 year old mother. They seemed to be content to mill off the point; surfacing very slowly with each breath. After awhile the whales changed direction, picked up some speed and were joined by J42 (Echo) Slick's 3 year old daughter. The fog lifted; J42 playfully swam upside down, sideways did a few breaches and then a spy hop and cartwheel! Our already happy crowd were delighted by this activity and the awesome scenery that revealed itself as the fog lifted. To top it off we spotted a <b>Minke Whale</b> off <b>South Beach</b> on the way back to Friday Harbor.

<b>2:45 p.m.</b> - 5 miles south of <b>Pt.

Leading were Raggedy K-40 and Cappuccino K-21. There was a group of whales not far behind the leaders: DoubleStuf J-34, Oreo J-22, Cookie J-38, Opus K-16, Sonata K-35, Rhapsody J-32, and Tsuchi J-31. Blackberry J-27 was behind this group and off to their right. Word was that there was a large group 4 to 5 miles behind this group.
<br/><b>8:20 p.m.</b> I began hearing faint calls on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b> and the first calls heard were K pod S-16 calls (the kitten sound) - then a few J pod calls. There were a few calls but mainly echolocation clicks that continued until about 11:30 pm.

Another day FULL of orcas off Hannah Heights, W San Juan Island! Beginning with hearing many blows from <b>12:30 - 1:30 am</b>, coming from all directions, possibly heading north but difficult to tell when you can't see anything. Then we began the day with <b>orcas off Hannah Heights at 9 am</b>, a small pod of Js heading north with some calves, but just passing through, not stopping to play like the previous day. 10:10 am a large male (J27?) traveling north with several females and a juvenile. 12:10 pm, 3 males and several females heading north. 12:35 pm, a larger group of Js and ? passed by heading south, foraging (heard J8). Then from 1:35 - 3 pm a large group mainly trending north hung out off Hannah Heights foraging, mating, actively milling back and forth, first close to shore then later further out. J1, J2 and family formed a resting line and headed north close to shore, and other started to group up. At 3:10 pm, most came back closer to shore, heading north up to Land Bank at 3:30, Js and Ls close in to shore. We haven't had time to go through our thousands of photos yet for IDs, but will post photos and IDs over the next few days.
<br/>We also heard reports that the L pod whales that had been up in Johnstone Strait June 17th came back via San Juan Channel and Friday Harbor where they surprised many townspeople!

We headed north, toward Turn Point on <b>Stuart Island</b> to catch up with <b>J Pod</b>. J Pod had been reported swimming north past Turn Point lighthouse. As we rounded the north side of Stuart, we started to see whale watch boats. Then, we started to see dorsal fins! Captain Mike motored the trusty MV Sea Lion toward a whale traveling in Boundary Pass. This whale turned out to be <b>19-year-old Mike (J26)</b>. Guests aboard viewed Mike as he traveled across Boundary Pass toward North Pender Island. The boat moved away from J26 and caught up with everyone's favorite whale - Ruffles (J1). He, too, was traveling toward North Pender Island. Eventually, we backtracked a bit. We caught up with a group of about 8 orcas, traveling in a close group. They appeared to be socializing - tail slaps, cartwheels, belly flops, and spy hops were in abundance today! These animals (like J26 and J1) were traveling towards North Pender. Eventually, they reached the shoreline and we traveled with them as they continued their socializing antics.

After watching the two groups passing by <b>Hannah Heights</b> in the morning (in the report sent 6/18), we had another pod pass Hannah Heights from about <b>4 - 6 pm</b>, heading north. It appeared to be J pod whales with some Ks (at least K21 &amp; J27 were present). They were spread out in small groups, and the last group included 3 males (K21 &amp; J27 +?) and 2 females traveling very close to each other in a tight group, going down &amp; coming up together, one time surfacing together in a tight group of 4 dorsals and 1 fluke!
<br/>We saw them off <b>Lime Kiln</b> at about <b>6:30 pm</b> as they continued north, then at 9:30 pm we saw them pass the Center for Whale Research, NW San Juan Island, heading south as the light faded, and lastly, as noted above, we heard more whales from Hannah Heights after midnight - a great day of whale sightings and hearings!

<b>Lime Kiln hydrophone - 0756</b> - Hearing loud <b>clicks and calls</b> (lots of S1s and some S4s implies J pod). First autodetection was at 07:40 at Lime Kiln and there were no others earlier at Orcasound, so they may be traveling north.

Lime Kiln at <b>7:30 am</b> your time. Started hearing faint calls around then, fading as boat passed. Became louder and more numerous with calls at 7:40 your time with splashes heard. Frequency of calls faded at 7:44 am, but could be heard intermittently. Quite loud squeals and blows at 7:50 am, some splashing and knocking as if at the hydrophone. Very loud clicking sounds heard as well as loud calls to 8:01 am. OMG!! Clicking continued thereafter, calls ceased. Clicking was more distant. Stopped listening at <b>8:11</b>, though calls and clicks were still able to be heard, and getting louder again.

We had a great day of watching <b>Js and Ks</b> from <b>Hannah Heights</b>, W San Juan Island. At <b>12:45 pm</b> they were heading south with some milling, foraging &amp; porpoising. IDs included <b>K21 &amp; K40, J22, J34, J14, J30, J38</b>. At <b>1:25 pm</b> several small groups were heading south including 2 females with calves, again foraging &amp; porpoising. At approx. 3:30 pm small groups of So. Residents were close in milling and foraging off Pile Pt, heading north, reaching Hannah Heights at around 4 pm. 2 large males, several juveniles and females and a sprouter were observed, spread out in small groups foraging. At 4:15 pm a male and several females headed south. 4:30 pm 2 females and 1 male headed north, a few minutes later 3 females and 1 male headed south, then 2 males and 1 female headed north, 1 went south, and ~5 others headed north (are we dizzy yet?!). 
<b>6:40 pm</b> members of <b>J pod</b> headed south past Hannah Heights. J1 and J2 were photographed at Lime Kiln around 5:45 pm (see above photo of J2) , remarkable as they were observed and photographed off Anacortes at 1:45 pm!
And to top off the day, as we watched a beautiful sunset, the whales started heading by Hannah Heights going south again, around 8:30 or 9 pm.

We definitely had <b>J-1 and J-2</b>, also J-30 but couldn't positively ID the females. There were perhaps 12-15 whales total. We found them just off <b>Washington Park in Anacortes</b>, around <b>11:20 am</b>, heading south - and after a side trip under the Deception Pass bridge, ultimately left them in roughly the same vicinity around 1:45 or so. It looked like they may have been heading towards Lopez when we left, but they were very spread out.

We received several 2nd hand reports on Facebook that <b>L pod</b> was sighted in <b>Johnstone Strait</b>, and found this on Mackay's Whale watch Facebook page, with many photos that definitely confirm many members of L pod up north! 
<br/>The second and last day with our tour group. This day we went to Nakwakto rapids a place where Belize and Seymour Inlet pour into a small gap creating fast moving rapids. We also saw a raft of kelp grizzlies (Sea otters!), a haul out of Northern sea lions, one humpback whale, 300 + pacific white sides and last but not least --- 20 or so Southern Resident Killer Whales from the "L" pod!

Orca Network received a call from Susan Bullerdick, who reported a small pod of <b>orcas </b>seen from the <b>Clinton/Mukilteo ferry</b> at about <b>7:45 am</b>. The orcas were heading north, looking like they were going to head up Saratoga Passage.

Hugh McIsaac called Orca Network to report seeing <b>3 - 4 orcas 5 miles south of Point Sur, CA</b>. They were out about 3.5 - 4 miles, and heading north. 
<br/>*<br/>
Today reports were of <b>J, K, and part of L- Pod</b> spread out several miles from the north to south end of <b>San Juan Island</b>. The family of L-22 Spirit, with teenage males L-85 Mystery, L-87 Onyx, L-89 Solstice, and L-79 Skana, along with L-12 Alexis seemed to be hunting for salmon until they reached the end of Salmon Bank and turned back toward the northwest. L-12 Alexis doesn't travel with this family regularly, but her grandchildren and great grandchildren have been seen with J-Pod lately, so perhaps the estimated 77 year old matriarch was enjoying a respite?! The pods have been mixing it up, challenging us to identify who is spending time with who!

We had an adventure out to <b>Swiftsure Bank</b> (west end of Strait of Juan de Fuca) yesterday (about 110 nautical miles each way), and amongst the 12-14' swells (so big you lost sight of land!) we found <b>6 humpbacks</b>!!! 
<br/>John Boyd (JB) SSAMN Marine Naturalist on Western Explorer 
<br/>*<br/> 
This evening's sunset tour was quiet the safari! The adventure started with the misty blows of <b>orca whales off Spieden Island</b>. As we approached them we were able to identify a few members of <b>Jpod</b>, including the impressive adult male "Ruffles", 100-year old "Granny", and "Blackberry". They traveled in a large closely knit pod, with at least eight other orcas. They swam along the backside of Spieden towards Turn Point on Stuart Island. The orcas became quite lively while heading over Boundary Pass, breaching, tail slapping, cartwheeling, and spy hopping. The crowd cheered at the thrill of seeing such playful behavior in their natural environment. It was difficult to leave the orcas, however we quickly spotted <b>dall's porpoises </b>as we returned home.

After such an amazing day filled with members of <b>all three pods</b> in tight groups, close passes in the kelp at the lighthouse and lots of resting lines, at <b>7:00pm</b> a lone <b>humpback whale</b> headed north off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> approx 200 yards from shore, the blows highlighted by the sun.

We arrived on San Juan Island for Howard to do a talk at the Whale Museum. I headed out to the west side, just missed the <b>So. Residents</b> at the Center for Whale Research at about <b>11:30 am</b> (they'd been heading N but turned back S just before I got there), so I headed down island to <b>Hannah Heights</b>, where at noon I saw two orcas just south of me, heading south (likely the tail end of a larger group) - it looked like a male/sprouter and a female. At 12:15 I saw 6 - 8 orcas heading N around Pt. Edwards, including 2 males, 3-5 females and a calf. At 12:25 3 - 4 orcas heading south, doing some milling - the male looked like J1. 12:33, J1, a female and a calf were then headed N. Another 4 orcas, including 1 male also headed N. At 12:40, what looked like some J pod groups were milling off Pt. Edwards, and some Whale Watch boats were further south toward False Bay, where another group of orcas were. At 1250, 6 or 7 orcas were in a resting line heading N off Pt. Edwards, and another 2 - 3 still milling just S of Edwards Pt.

I believe these are two of the three youngest members of <b>J-17's</b> family.

At 10 am, some turned south, and between 11 and noon, the rest of J pod showed up off the Center for Whale Research from the north. Between 11 am and 1 pm, all the whales came down island past Eagle Pt. At 2 pm, they all headed north, spread out between Hannah Heights and the Center for Whale Research. They headed back south around 6 pm, then turned north again. While he was talking to me, he saw an orca breach off Hannah Heights at 9:20 pm.

We had a nice trip north and west around San Juan Island to find <b>orcas </b>from <b>J-Pod</b> near shore off of <b>Lime Kiln Point</b> State Park. Amazing to watch five generations of an orca family; J-2 Granny, estimated to be 99 years old, along with her son J-1 Ruffles estimated at 59 years old, and constant traveling companion J-8 Spieden estimated 77 years old! However it looked like little 9 year old J-37 Hy'Shqa was ahead of the adults, spending some time with great grandma J-2! They seemed to be foraging, looking for salmon. The rest of J-Pod was spread out behind them in Haro Strait, and reports were that K-Pod had headed toward the south end.

After watching <b>J's and the L2's</b> pass by the Center for Whale Research (NW San Juan Island), Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster and Erin Heydenreich departed Snug Harbor and headed north. We encountered <b>L88, L78, L2, J1 and J2</b> spread out off <b>Spieden Channel</b> traveling north at <b>3:23 p.m</b>. (48° 35.462 N,123° 12.463W). We later encountered J33 traveling with J8. The next group we spotted was the rest of the J16's, who appeared to be the last whales going north. Other J's and K's were reported further down the west side of San Juan Island.

We had confirmation of whales approaching San Juan Island. It was a bit choppy down south, and [<b>orcas</b>] were heading north, so we looped over the top of the island and arrived just north of the <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> just as the whales were passing by. The whales were mostly hugging the shore, and we were staying 1/4 mile off shore (observing the voluntary no-boat zone). But that didn't mean we didn't get to see any whales! We had a very nice viewing of J1 Ruffles, who was hanging a bit offshore, as was J2 Granny. We also noted J8 Speiden, and J33 Keet. But the thrill of the day was a nice young male that passed about 150 yards off our starboard side. Big fin, finger saddle patch--so my mind went to J27 Blackberry. But something didn't quite look right, and our other naturalist Katie was beaming when she said it was L78 Gaia! I was skeptical at first, but sure enough, it was him!!! Even more exciting was the sighting by Katie of L2 Grace!! This is the first time this year that these whales had been seen so it was good to be able to check of that they made it through another winter. We didn't see my favorite L Pod whale in this group (L88 Wavewalker), but Jeanne called me to let me know he was lagging a bit behind but also present! We left the leaders just working the tide rips at Kellett Bluff heading north. We heard reports that some members of K Pod were also present further south around False Bay, but we didn't have time to see them.

<b>Pt. Roberts</b> is a fantastic land-based whale watch park with often long passes, hanging out for foraging/socializing and less intrusive boat traffic. Today it was 2 hours until the last <b>orcas </b>were out of sight. One group spent over 30 minutes foraging in the South Beach "Bay" as commonly seen. As they first approached a little one porpoised and an adult breached. They were very spread out in stormy seas that were calming under a beautiful blue sky. Some were very close off the park. I saw one do a flip as several met up. J2 "Granny" (estimated birth 1911) was close to shore while J1"Ruffles" (estimated birth 1951) was a bit further ahead. Near the end it was J14 (born 1974) with her baby J45 (born Feb/March 2009).

On Maya's Westside Charters <b>3:00pm</b>, we met with some <b>J pod</b> whales and 4 <b>K pod</b> whales in <b>Boundary Pass </b>heading south. These 4 K pod whales - K21, K40, K16 and K35 - were with all of J pod when they were last seen on Thursday June 10. After a 2 day absence it was great to see them again. However, I am not sure if all of J pod was present. Those seen by us were the J1, J2, J14s, J16s, J8, J19 and J41 and the 4 K pod whales. The J11s, J17s and J22s...hum where were they? These three groups had split from the rest last week for a day. I'm not sure if that happened again or not. Maybe someone got a picture of one of the J11s, J17s or J22s yesterday.

We spotted three members of our <b>Southern Resident orca community</b> when we arrived at <b>Monarch Head</b> BC. There was a female orca traveling with a subadult and a calf. Our good luck continued when we saw one of the whales breaching about 200 yards away, giving us a great view of its glossy belly. As we followed the whales south we identified the male orca J-26 "Mike". This 19 year old juvenile was given his nickname after the whale researcher Mike A. Bigg who passed away in 1991. Our next stop was Turn Point on Stuart Island. Captain Mike stopped the boat and I lowered our high-tech hydrophone into the water, enabling our lucky crew to hear the whales communicating. Listening to their serenading vocalizations made for one of the most peaceful days I have experienced on the water. Sunkissed and blissed we returned back to Friday Harbor.

Fed as a "right sided" gray; as we could see several times it twist/spiral onto its right side to suction the shrimp. All captured on film. Mid June gray in this area is something. We would not have been able to capture this memorable experience, without your faithful daily reports. Would not have gone searching, unless, we had heard grays are still around. And, here we are, nearing mid June.

On Puget Sound Express return from Friday Harbor to Port Townsend we saw at least <b>three minkes</b> hunting together in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> just south of eastern San Juan Island. One of them had a series of bumps forward of the dorsal fin.
<br/>Andrew Reding 
<br/><i>Andrew sent his photos to Jonathan Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Project, and Jon replied: Nice photographs, thank you very much andrew - and we know these whales. the one with the bumps is interesting. these bumps are the spinous processes of the vertebrae - this animal is kind of thin, but they will disappear as he puts on some weight throughout the feeding season. or, of course he may be sick - but we have seen these bumps on a whale, and they have disappeared.

There was a lone <b>Minke </b>working his way south to north off of <b>Lagoon point, Whidbey Island</b> Saturday <b>afternoon</b>. Pretty slowly with long dives in between about 1/3 of the way into the channel. It was pretty clearly a Minke because of the smallish hook dorsal.

As a follow up to Julia's report, it seems the [<b>orca</b>] pod consisted of 6 animals, including 2 calves.

Just before <b>6 PM</b> they started coming. Rather than grab the binoculars as I usually do, I went out on the front lawn and just watched with my naked eyeballs as a rather large group of <b>orcas </b>came through <b>Active Pass</b>, hugging the shoreline at Helen Point as they entered Georgeson Bay. There was a bit of tail lobbing, an occasional breach, and what looked like quite a bit of fun as they came through. Then a second wave of orcas (looked like J pod to me) showed up, and when the got into the middle of the Pass, they all congregated quite closely to each other and rested near the surface for a few minutes. And then they went under, not to be seen again on this splendid evening.

Captain Craig, the guests, and I cruised north, meeting members of <b>J Pod</b> off of <b>Kellet Bluff on Henry Island</b>. Henry Island is just northwest of San Juan Island. We started the whale watching portion of the trip watching the Southern Resident Community's most famous member Ruffles, or J1. He traveled along in the lead, not an uncommon behavior for this old guy. After he had passed us by he sharked around up ahead of us at our one o'clock, appearing for roll onto his right side and slowly swim along the surface. After this great viewing, we watched a few whales traveling past us, heading toward Turn Point. Eventually, a large group of tail-slapping, pec-slapping, cartwheeling orcas came past our port side. They were socializing in a way I personally haven't seen yet all season. After they passed by us, we watched them continue their antics all the way up to Stuart Island. In this large group was one adult male, many females (or younger males), a few young animals, and a very young calf. I also saw J26, Mike, having some alone time with a female I was unable to identify. The only orcas I identified today were members of J Pod, but I heard talk of K Pod over the radio and there were many animals I saw that I didn't ID.

The whales were traveling back to the north. This is when it got really confusing. I had heard calls over <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> starting at <b>4:20 am</b>. and they moved over to <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b>. When it got light enough, I saw whales going north. Someone else heard whales over the Lime Kiln hydrophones at about<b> 8:30 a.m</b>. and soon L pod whales (the same groups as mentioned above) were going up island. My pictures show that the <b>Lpod </b>group of five - L12, L85, L22, L79 and L89 were at <b>Open Bay</b> at <b>10:30 a.m</b>. My pictures also show that at 11:15 at Turn Pt. milling about were the J22s and the J17s. Closer to Spieden Island at 12:00, were L12, L85, L22, L79 and L89 in a spread out group heading back down island; the group of L41,L25,L94,L113,and L77 had turned back at Open Bay at about 10:30 and were heading down Island. I heard one operator say that there were 8 to to 10 whales in that group - so I thought that J27,J31 and J39 were still with them. However, when they passed by at Lime Kiln there were only 5 present - L41,L25,L94,L113,L77. We had been at Turn Pt. watching the J22s and the J17s. They didn't seem to be going anywhere, but trending to the north. At 12:30 as we were coming back down island, whales were spotted out in the middle of the Channel going up island - it was J27, J31 and J39 heading north. in the <b>evening K pod and L87</b> came in from the west and stayed south.

We saw a solitary whale in Useless Bay. It was not an Orca, most likely a <b>Gray Whale</b>, but it was pretty far away in the middle of Useless Bay (where the upwelling is) and well out of the shipping channel. We watched this animal for about 30 minutes (8 pm). The whole time, it swam in circles on the surface and appeared to be bobbing in the water (taking bites; surface feeding?) at about 1 bob per second. We had good binoculars, but it was pretty far away. It had barnacles on it's nose. We saw a fin from time to time and several blows. It appeared to be quite long and slender. We watched until it was too cold and dark. Is this consistent with Gray Whale feeding behavior?? It definitely was a whale; the first live one we have seen in Useless Bay in 8 years!

The Center for Whale Research received a report of <b>K pod</b> coming in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca around <b>3 p.m</b>.

The L12's came from the south west side of San Juan Island and met up with the K's around Middle Bank. We observed lots of milling, tactile behavior with lots of breaches, taillobs, and logging. All K pod whales were photographed and accounted for, including a new calf. The <b>new calf, K43</b>, was seen traveling with <b>K12</b>. We were also able to determine that K36 is a female. The encounter ended at 7:37 p.m. north of Middle bank (48° 23.60 N, 123° 04.53 W). The whales continued to travel east in spread out groups. They reportedly turned around later and went back out the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

They were traveling slow and close to the shore of Henry Island. We left the group at 10:18 a.m. and went north to Turn Point. We encountered J17, J35, J44, and J47 traveling north. We observed a lot of surface activity, mostly from the calves and especially from J pod's youngest member, J47. We later spotted the J22's also traveling north toward Swanson Channel.

<b>K pod</b> returned, bringing with them a new calf. <b>K43 </b>was seen traveling with <b>K12</b>, who is presumed to be the mother. K12 is estimated to be 38 years old. She has two existing offspring, K22 and K37, and one grandchild, K33 (son of K22). K pod was first seen this year on February 21st, traveling up Swanson Channel with J pod. Photographs taken by Jeanne Hyde on Jim Maya's boat suggested the presence of a new K pod calf, but we were unable to confirm with any certainty. The June 8 encounter with K43 confirms that the calf is at least 5 months old. The population of K pod is now 20 whales. This is the third calf born in 2010.

The reports were in, telling us to search near the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> for a group of <b>L-pod orca whales</b>. We arrived at False Bay shortly after departing from Friday Harbor. From the sunny deck of the Sea Lion we saw a tall, glossy dorsal fin slice through the surface of the water. The scar half way down the dorsal fin hinted that we were looking at<b> L-41</b> "Mega". Mega was born in 1977, one year after the study of the Southern Resident Community had begun. We have been able to watch him grow from a small calf into the large adult male that we saw today. We continued south to view three other members of the pod near Lime Kiln State Park. The site was picture perfect. The orcas were swimming right in front of the Lime Kiln lighthouse and snow-capped Mount Baker was off in the distance.

3:30 pm spotted at least two pairs of <b>Harbor Porpoise</b>, sighted from <b>Edmonds </b>Beach park south of the marina. First we both saw a large splash ( like a breach splash) south of the ferry lane across towards Kingston, then noticed one fin. Saw a couple more fin surfaces further south. Not certain if the same animal but the splash had us intrigued as we have not ourselves seen that before with the Harbor porpoise. Closer to us, 500 yards from the beach, a pair surfaced a few times heading south. Shortly after spotted another (or first ) pair across mid channel south of ferry lane heading south.
<br/>Alisa &amp; Ed Brooks
<br/><i>hmm - wonder if the "splashing" porpoise <b>may have been Dall's</b> rather than Harbor porpoise? Dall's are known to often have a characteristic "rooster tail" splash while porpoising out of the water - sb</i>

We were lucky to see about <b>8 Orcas</b> at <b>8:30am</b> as they moved past our home (near Rocky Point, North <b>Nanaimo</b>) heading north. They were definitely feeding as they circled around a couple of times, and were moving very fast.

We eventually found some <b>L Pod</b> whales in the southern <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, just east of of East Point, Saturna Island. These whales, the <b>L12's</b>, appeared to be resting in the very calm waters. We observed L94 with little L113 beside her. The old girls, <b>L25 and L12</b>, were both there, as well as L41. A little further ahead - more whales. The trailing group of J pod consisted of the J17's and J22's. Both little calves, J46 and J47, were seen with their moms (see above photo). This group also appeared to be resting. As we entered into Boundary Pass, a freighter in the shipping lanes threw quite a wake. Several J Pod whales were traveling very close to the Saturna Island shoreline when the wake caught up to them. Some of the whales surfed the wave, some breached. We left the whales traveling slowly westbound, against a weak flood tide.

The mist gave way to partially clear skies and calm seas as we headed around San Juan Island to find family groups of <b>J-Pod</b> and reports of<b> K-Pod</b> by <b>Kellet Bluff</b>! The whales had been swimming at a fast pace with the flooding- incoming tide. J-16 Slick and family slowed down and we were awed by a variety of behaviors; breaches, cartwheels, headstands, and tail lobs! Nineteen year old J-26 Mike and fifteen year old J-30 Ridptide were showing off their male parts! We also got a glimpse of one of the new calves of either J-28 or sister J-35.

A mix of <b>J and L pods</b> on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> from Lime Kiln Point State Park to Andrews Bay. Animals were spread out in several groups, converging and dispersing intermittently. We saw <b>L41, J28 with calf, J26</b> and many more not identified. There was very aggressive feeding behavior with multiple percussive displays. Just before we departed the scene at 1510 L41 displayed his "sea snake" while swimming with several females and possibly juveniles.

About 1/4 mile off <b>San Juan County Park</b> Ruffles <b>J1 </b>was very easy to pick out, as was <b>J27 </b>Blackberry and <b>J30 </b>Riptide. They approached the large bed of bull kelp near Low Island (off San Juan County Park), and began to roll in the kelp. Long strands tangling dorsal fins and tail flukes. Dozens and dozens of spyhops. The whales would split into two groups, circle around the kelp,and then race back towards each other. From our vantage point, we saw one youngster roll over and was carried for awhile on the back of J27. A few breaches followed by more rolling, spyhops, and lolling at the surface.

We found ourselves in <b>Transient Orca</b> heaven once again today. We had a report of approximately 6 individuals in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, and after some effort, we managed to locate that group. It was the <b>T2C's and T123s</b> - 6 whales. We had last seen these two groups on the 24th of May, traveling northbound in the Strait. Now they were traveling slowly south, doing extremely long dives and possibly resting. While we waited for this group to surface, splashing and fins were noted about 1 mile away, closer to <b>Galiano Island</b>. We left the first group of resting T's, and met up with a larger group - <b>T87, T88, T90, T90B, the T100's, T124 and T124D</b> were Id'ed. These orcas were also traveling south, but in greater haste. However, when a seal was sensed on the surface, most of the group turned around. T87 and T88 continued southbound - more about them later. The T100's, T124's and T90's were determined to get that seal when suddenly, yet another seal appeared on the surface. Both seals lay very still, and it took many passes, some quite close to the seals, before the whales took one, then the other. With their mission accomplished, our group turned once again to the south and began porpoising down the Strait (see photo above). They kept up this amazing show of power for 15-20 minutes, at times reaching speeds over 12 knots. While speed swimming, the T100's, et al, passed right by the still slowly traveling T2C's and T123's without even a break in their pace. They eventually met up with T87 and T88 again, just north of Active Pass. They made a sharp right turn into Active Pass, and we left them traveling westbound through the pass at Miner's Bay. As we headed back across the Strait, there were the T2Cs, T123's, still slowly swimming south, although it appeared they might follow the T100's,etc. through Active Pass.

At <b>1300 </b>the <b>Js </b>were extremely spread out off the Tsawassen Ferry Dock. From nearly one side of Georgia Strait to another. They appeared to be focused on food searches. Off Lighthouse Marine Park, Point Roberts a male lunged after a meal within 50 feet off the beach. The water was shallow and he might have rubbed the bottom. He then bolted past the Lifeforce boat perhaps after that big one that got away. Orcas in the "Point Roberts Bay" spend a lot of time foraging. This is a critical habitat area where orcas forage and socialize if not disturbed by boat traffic. Caution is advised when travelling in this area. Many Js grouped up when approaching East Point at approximately <b>1600</b>. At approximately <b>1700 </b>the J orcas were heading west in <b>Boundary Pass</b> off Java Rocks while Ruffles, Granny and others passed East Point, Saturna Island. As Lifeforce waited for all to pass Ruffles breached twice. As L, K and Js head back into Haro Strait and others are in Georgia Strait on June 6th it is " to be continued".

We'd received word of <b>Transient Orcas</b> several nautical miles <b>Southeast of Hein Bank</b> heading towards Puget Sound. Once on scene we encountered the <b>T-30's, T-102</b> and others actively hunting a Harbour Seal (always thrilling to watch them give chase) on this day, however, the Harbour Seal outsmarted these intelligent creatures by 'jumping' up onto the Starboard engine 'water jet' of the Victoria Clipper III to seek refuge. After several minutes the Transients swam on in search of other food sources, but the poor little Seal spent the next 25 minutes resting on top of the water jet of the Victoria Clipper. The vessel was dead in the water as they were not able to start the engines, so for approximately 25 minutes the Captain and crew of the Clipper attempted to get the reluctant Seal to return to the water. The seal finally returned to the water once the whales were miles away. Never seen this before !!! Brilliant encounter with the whales today as we saw lots of Breaches, Dolphin Leaps, Tail Flips and had great vocalizations.

We were on the wrong side of the pod for good ID photos, their dorsal shadow somewhat obscures their saddle patches. However I'm sure you or Dave will know these guys by the shape of their dorsals, one leans to the right, and another's tip seems to point forward. When we left they were still heading south west (we were directly west of <b>Partridge Point, Whidbey Island</b>, 2 or 3 miles out, hard to tell, when we left them). We also saw a minke fairly close to Minor Island on the return to Anacortes.

We just got this report from Rod Whitten who observed <b>3-5 killer whales</b> chasing sea lions northwest of the entrance to <b>Grays Harbor</b> @ <b>19:00</b>.

With reports from Jill Hein and Erick Peirson of a group of <b>10 - 12 transient orcas</b> headed south off <b>Partridge Point</b>, Whidbey Island around <b>2 pm</b>, I headed to Ft. Casey, opposite Pt. Wilson at the entrance to Admiralty Inlet to watch for them. Having no luck after an hour scanning the horizon, I was about to leave my perch on the bluff when I looked down and saw a suspicious dark gray fin slicing the water just 30 feet from the waves lapping the beach. Within seconds a second fin swished up about 20 feet from the first and I realized <b>a small gray whale was searching for food</b> at my feet. That was at <b>3:40pm</b>, and from there I accompanied this whale for about a mile down the beach, <b>around Admiralty Head and almost to the Keystone ferry dock</b>, whereupon the whale turned south and <b>headed toward Lagoon Point at 4:35pm</b>. The whale repeated the pattern of swimming a few hundred yards, then rolling on its side in typical feeding activity, then moving on to the next prospective meal. Since this is not known to be a place where grays have fed before, and the whale never stayed in any one place after one feeding attempt, I'm assuming this gray whale is unfamiliar with the best feeding spots and probably didn't find much.

Today we saw <b>J34 </b>Doublestuf along with a few other J's on the south end of <b>San Juan Island</b>. J34 came along side of us and I took a picture of him, and upon reviewing that picture I noticed a very pronounced depression behind his blowhole. I've heard of peanut heads, but I don't think I've ever actually seen one. I'm guessing that is what this is, and am wondering how "bad" it is (see photo above)? I know some of the residents have had peanut heads in the past and come back from it, so lets keep our fingers crossed that Doublestuf and the rest of his family are finding a lot of Chinook!

Off the west side of San Juan Island on the 3.30pm Ocean Magic out of Victoria, we headed over to where it had been reported that <b>members of J Pod were seen foraging</b>. Sure enough we saw <b>Ruffles </b>by himself close to shore, but most of our time was spent with <b>Polaris, J28 and her little one, J46</b>. There we saw three rambuncous youngsters, tail lobbing, breaching, backward swimming, spyhopping as well as mothers demonstrating very active behaviours. It was lovely to see these members of this productive family group all together. Totally awesome encounter, made even better with calm conditions and plenty of sunshine.

This morning we got reports of whales way up by Pender Island heading North towards Active Pass. As we approached Navy Channel we had heard that <b>J-pod</b> which has 28 animals had split into two groups. The main group went through <b>Active Pass</b> and was <b>entering Georgia Strait</b> heading towards Vancouver as the smaller group of 13 animals including <b>4 J-22's, 6 J-17's and 3 J-11's</b> turned right at Navy Channel and headed East towards Saturna Island. The six J-17 whales were really playful with lots of breaches and tail flips. Great vocalizations were heard throughout the entire tour. During my 16 years as a whale watching captain here in Victoria, I have only seen the Resident Whales go through this channel a handful of times !!!!! Just before we left the scene, the whales did an amazing turn as they went North past Lizard and Curlew Island towards <b>Georgeson Pass</b>. Absolutely amazing to see J-pod go through this narrow little passage to get back out into Georgia Strait. Never seen this one before.
<br/>Jeff Lamarche, Captain/Biologist, Eagle Wing Tours
<br/>*<br/>
We had heard that J-pod was already going through <b>Active Pass</b> We then received news that part of J-pod had turned south and was heading south in Navy Channel. This was something I had never heard of before. Over the radio we continued to get reports that they were heading south, now into Plumper Sound. Next the news was that they had turned NE and were going through the pass just south of <b>Georgeson Island</b>! As far as I know this is a first for the Southern Residents to travel through these areas (some fairly narrow and shallow passages) in the Gulf Islands. We arrived on scene around <b>1:30pm</b>, just after they entered the Strait of Georgia. They spread out quickly and started to forage. We saw two belly flop breaches, heard vocalizations over the Hydrophone, and had a wonderful encounter with J-27 Blackberry along with a few other members of J-pod.

<b>7:45 am...J Pod</b> on the <b>hydrophones</b>, most likely going north. We find part of J pod headed east in <b>Navy Ch</b>., between N. Pender and Maynes Islands, BC. East? I've never seen them do anything in Navy Ch. Only a couple of the most experienced captains have seen them there. Then they turn north and start going up <b>Georgeson Pass</b>, a narrow channel that connects Navy Ch. with the Strait of Georgia. I know of no one who has ever seen Orcas in this pass, until today. To many, this might seem mundane. To myself and my fellow captains, it was a sight we have never seen before and it was amazing! This picture may be the only one in existence of a breach in this particular spot of the pass.
