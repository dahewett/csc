<h3><center>June 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>August 31, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Do you have any idea who the [<b>orcas</b>] were that we heard last <b>night </b>in the <b>Sansum Narrows</b>? I was sleeping out on the covered porch and was woken up at <b>1:30 am </b>to the sound of tons of blows. I raced up to the cottage to tell our guests who have been here many times! And they thought the house was on fire! We all ran down to the dock in our PJ's and listened for a whole hour. There seemed to be lots and lots of whales. 
<br/>(Phoebe talking now) At first you couldn't see anything but then blurry black shapes appeared, turning into fins, getting closer, and then disappearing into the water. There was a sense of awesome power in the whales movements, sounds,and even in the air. You were thankful to see it but also terrified. Later that night an otter family hid under the dock, afraid of the whales but also, like us, in awe. 
<br/>(This is Anna) It was magical to be standing on the dock with Jupiter shining brightly above with the whales blowing constantly. They were blowing and splashing so much that there were waves lapping at the dock. It sounded like there were about 60 or more whales. In the morning it felt like a dream.

<b>6:30 pm</b> - I have been listening to some wonderful Orca <b>calls </b>and echolocation clicks for the past 60mins on the <b>Lime Kilm Hydrophone</b>. Presumably SR's sounds. It must be party time once again, even in the rain.
<br/>Marie O'Shaughnessy, Victoria B.C.

About <b>2:30</b> this afternoon, the first of a spread out, very large group of [<b>orcas</b>] entered <b>Active Pass</b>, swimming eastward. At one point, there were several different groups in the pass and it was hard to figure out which one to watch. Lots of resting lines, fishing activity, spyhops, breaches, and tail slaps. 
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>2:00PM</b> we observed <b>five Orcas</b> just outside <b>Ladysmith Harbour</b> (Nanaimo) (N49 00; W 123 48). There appeared to be two adult females, a juvenile female and two young. They exhibited classic salmon feeding behavior and swam around us for about an hour. We got some grainy photos and are trying to identify them. 
<br/>Dave Twyver
<br/>*<br/>
My husband happened to scan the water <b>tonight </b>(even though it was a rainy, dreary day) and he spotted what appeared to be J-pod (but we're thinking more likely the Transient pod that was in Puget Sound? ON) having a major party out in front of our house. We are located just north of <b>Edmonds </b>and a little south of Browns Bay.
There were <b>9-12 [orcas]</b>, and at least one of them was a baby. The pod was fairly close to our shore, and was slowly moving north at <b>6:45pm</b>. One of the whales had an enormous dorsal fin, and we're guessing that was probably Ruffles. We saw around 15 breaches (a few of them were babies), a couple of rolls with fantastic pectoral fin action, and too many tail slaps to count. The pod party went on for 1/2 hour, and they all disappeared after that. It was the best whale show we've ever seen, and we've lived here for 8 years now. 
<br/>Laurie and Paul, Edmonds, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Group of <b>three orcas</b>, one large fin, one medium fin, one small fin at <b>1045 ADT</b> in position: 60* 55 N &amp; 175* 08 W - <b>Bering Sea</b>. Did not look like they were heading in any certain direction, they seemed to be feeding in the area.

<br/>*<br/>
After searching for reported transients around Morsby Island and Schwartz Bay, Center staff headed to Turn Point and encountered <b>residents </b>milling in groups at <b>11:36 a.m.</b> (48° 41.146 N,123° 15.992 W). The encounter ended in lower <b>Swanson Channel</b> at <b>12:46 p.m.</b> (48° 44.718 N, 123° 17.960 W) with the whales traveling steadily north.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Not sure if you were aware of <b>4 transient whales</b> were spotted in front of my house on <b>Hamersley inlet, Shelton Washington</b>. This is the second year in a row they have visited to feed on the seals. They were feeding and hanging out 8/29 &amp; back again 8/30. Last year they visited around Sept 4th. 
<br/>Wendy Allan, Shelton, Washington
<br/>*<br/>
We were NORTH of the Fraser, watching Sockeyes jumping all over the place, and some <b>Orcas </b>. By the way, more Sockeyes this year than any year since 1913. Later on in the day, more residents were found heading south near <b>Pt. Roberts</b>.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Just came back from my vacation to see a <b>superpod </b>going through <b>Active Pass</b>!! As usual in the pass, we had breaches, spyhops and tail slaps.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
I'm on the west side of <b>North Pender</b>, just north of Thieves Bay (48.775311,-123.316898). <b>Over 30 orca</b> passed by here, between <b>12:45 p.m. and 1:15 p.m.</b>, heading north towards <b>Active Pass</b>. There was a tremendous amount of tail slapping going on out there, along with spyhopping and a few breaches. I even saw one of the babies porpoising alongside an adult. They went by rather slowly, and some individuals swam back south and then turned north again. Several large males went by, one probably Ruffles. 
<br/>Nancy Westrell (Portland OR) 
<br/>*<br/>
Today we ventured to <b>Active Pass</b> in Canada to admire those beautiful black and white creatures known as <b>Orcas</b>. We caught up to the whales as they were making there way through the pass and out into open waters. There were orcas as far as the eye could see practically! This large grouping was a mix of different pods and they were very spread out. We observed parts of <b>J pod</b> with a small grouping of <b>L pod</b> nearby. In the distance large splashes were observed as the whales breached and slapped their tails. It was not long before the groups near us were doing the same actions. We even got to observe a few spy hops, which are my personal favorite. 
<br/>San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
On the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Lots of <b>orcas </b>were slowly headed north, many in groups. There was a breaching contest way offshore.
<br/>Jane Cogan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:17am</b> - Seeing <b>orcas </b>on the <b>Orcacam </b>! Looked like several whales going north through the straight. Definitely a pod, we think Jpod from the sounds coming from Orcasound hyrdophone. Incredible. Saw tail lobs and other fun stuff. Also saw a baby orca!
<br/>Jay Schilling (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Jill Nylan called at <b>9:08 AM</b> to report <b>15-20 orcas</b> going past <b>Lime Kiln park</b> headed north. 
<br/>*<br/>
S1,2,10,16 and many other clear <b>calls </b>at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> now, first auto-detected at <b>8:20 am</b>, but not at Orcasound earlier, so maybe they are northbound.<b> 9:24 am</b>, S19 calls and clicks now at <b>OrcaSound </b>from northbound SRKWs.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:55am</b> Starting to hear FAINT <b>calls </b>@ <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b> now! <b>8:27am</b> Loud and Clear now! <b>9:12am</b> Hearing them on <b>Orcasound </b>also.

<br/>Dorothy Brinz 
<br/>*<br/>
Lots of media reports this <b>morning </b>of a lone <b>gray whale</b> swimming near the Dundarave pier in <b>West Vancouver</b>. Approx lat/long coordinates would be: N 49 20.047', W 123 11.266. This is along the North shoreline of Vancouver's outer harbour, West of the Lions Gate bridge, roughly halfway to the lighthouse at Point Atkinson, which demarcates the outer limit of the harbour.

Orca Network received a message from a caller reporting <b>4 orcas</b> in <b>Rocky Bay</b> (NE San Juan Island?), heading south down the inlet. He had been watching them from <b>3 - 4 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
At noon today, <b>4 orcas</b> heading north in pickering passage near north end of <b>squaxin island</b>! All looked pretty close in size viewed from about 1/4 mile.
<br/>Patrick Brennan, Seattle
<br/>*<br/>
Susan Rabago called Orca Network at <b>10:32 am</b> to say she was watching at least <b>4 orcas</b> - 1 male and 3 smaller including one very small - in Oakland Bay (<b>Shelton, WA</b>), with 3 boats and a kayak close by. As she spoke they turned SE into Hammersley Inlet.
<br/>*<br/>
This morning my husband and I saw <b>3 orcas</b> traveling south to north along the west side of <b>Squaxin Island</b> (S. Puget Sound) about 7 a.m. None of them had a big fin.
<br/>Molly Brown 
<br/>*<br/> 
Watched as what looked to be <b>three orcas</b> moved north up Oakland Bay near <b>Shelton </b>with the flooding tide, then when the tide turned they retreated to the south, where the bay connects to Hammersley Inlet which is the connection to the main sound. There was one orca who was larger, a mid-size and a smaller one in this group. We watched from the porch of our house which is about at the middle of the bay between Shelton and the Deer Creek peninsula that is the northern boundary of the main bay.
<br/>Nate Thomas
<br/>*<br/>
lots of <b>orcas </b>just swam past false bay (west <b>SJI</b>) going south at <b>1:24pm</b>.

Chris Kennedy of WA State Ferry Ops reported the ferry Chelan captain saw <b>8-10 orcas</b> in <b>Haro St.</b>, near Danger Shoal, headed north at <b>1622</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
So. Resident <b>Killer Whales</b> in <b>Haro Strait</b> crossing over to Canada at the confluence with Boundary Pass. Spread out in small groups of 1-4 with some active foraging and percussive behaviors.
<br/>Tristen Joy, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:15 pm</b> - [<b>orcas</b>] are already passing <b>Kellet Bluff, Haro Strait</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
Very weak <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> at <b>7:18 pm</b>.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
I think we arrived at <b>Lime Kiln</b> around <b>1:45</b> or so. Within moments, blows were spotted to the south. Soon, [<b>orcas</b>] were right in front of us delighting all with their presence. It was so cool to be so close to them from land. We could hear them breathe and binoculars were not needed for a good look. My 16 yr old declared the day to be pretty awesome and I couldn't agree more. We saw some tail slapping and a spyhop. Our guide, who was fabulous but who's name I don't recall, said she saw some cartwheeling while they were still a ways out. She also said they seemed to be foraging. We saw quite a few spread over 90 min. or so.
<br/>Lori Willson, Seattle, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:30 am</b> - fun to watch a <b>minke </b>surface off the south end of <b>Lopez Island</b> in the herring balls and scatter the gulls, minke was fairly close to shore, several changes in direction. 
<br/>Sally Reeve, Lopez Island, WA
<br/><br/>

<br/>*<br/>
<b>1500-1600</b> we viewed <b>transient orcas T168, T168A, T168B and T169</b> traveling SW down <b>Boundary Pass</b> parallel to Saturna Island. They were offshore and seemed to be resting. There was only one instance of milling, which was over very quickly and no apparent foraging.
<br/>Tristen Joy, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1400-1415</b> a <b>minke </b>whale crossed our path traveling NE across <b>San Juan Channel</b> from San Juan Island towards Neck Point on Shaw Island. He was transiting at moderate speed keeping a steady heading.

I spent some time listening to our beloved <b>orcas </b>tonight via the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. I first heard them at <b>9pm</b>. They sounded very faint at that time. By 9:11 they seemed to be very close by. 9:13 they began to vocalize more and more energetically. 
<br/>Kelli Wolford of Portland, Or
<br/>*<br/>
I believe <b>all three pods</b> returned into the area after heading west this <b>morning</b>.

<b>August 26, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Spotted <b>Orcas </b>heading South in the <b>Tacoma Narrows</b> right in front of Doc Hastings Park (Now called Narrows bridge park) at <b>13:30 hours</b>. They were not in a big hurry and were headed to Fox Island. Not sure what pod they are from. 
<br/>Capt Jim Keith, Fox Island Salmon Charters
<br/><i>this is most likely a pod of Transients, possibly the same pod reported in the other sightings above in S. Puget Sound - ON.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Listening to a chorus of orca <b>calls </b>on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b> (NW San Juan Island) while putting together today's whale report! Tuned in at <b>4:30 pm</b>, calls continuing until about 5 pm, then at 5:30 pm began to hear faint calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone, so they must be heading south.

We had an after dinner treat in three parts this evening. Starting around <b>7:40 pm</b>, the first of 3 groups of <b>orcas </b>entered <b>Active Pass</b>, heading east. In the first bunch was Mr. Ruffles. The 3rd group was the most active, with many tail slaps. It took about an hour for all of them to pass our viewpoint on Galiano Island and head into the light of the moonrise.

We were now on our way towards <b>Salmon Bank</b> just off the west side of San Juan Island to see the Orcas. Well it's been about 4 days since I've seen Ruffles (J-1) and I was very excited to see his big wavy fin today. There was lots of social activity today and members of different pods were seen mixing and mingling. The Orcas were not the only show around though. A <b>minke whale</b> appeared traveling right in the middle of the <b>orcas</b>. Captain Mike alerted everyone to all of the bubbles appearing at the bow. The water was crystal clear and as he looked down a minke slid gracefully beneath our boat. We were eye to eye with the Minke whale since he was turned sideways staring up - perhaps he was out people watching?

<br/>*<br/>
Position: 54* 04N &amp; 166* 36W, just north of <b>Dutch Harbor, AK</b> at <b>1115 ADT</b>, spotted five to six killer whales. Seemed to be two large males, few medium sized dorsal fins, and one very small dorsal fin that seemed to be lagging behind. The whales were heading to the east.

Breathtaking encounter with 2 very Acrobatic <b>Humpback </b>in the morning! We were only a few miles south of <b>Victoria </b>this morning when 2 Humpback Whales, <b>a Mother and Calf</b>, were spotted. The first glimpse of the Humpbacks I had was when the youngster Cartwheeled, and we were still a couple of miles away from the scene. Not long after we arrived on scene the young Calf began to cartwheel and tail lob, then suddenly to everyone's delight the youngster breached multiple times, it was amazing! Then the mother also Cartwheeled and tail slapped, we even had the two animals doing synchronized tail lobs: )
We left the two Humpbacks just heading East towards Dungeness Spit into the fog after an amazing encounter!

Once again, mother <b>Humpback Whale</b> and her youngster were seen out there in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, south of 
<b>Victoria</b>, entertaining the WW boats. Conditions were very challenging at <b>4.30pm</b>. I do believe with the wind at 25-30knots, and the water at a 3ft chop or more, those whales were totally energised. The spectacle certainly got me excited. They breached repeatedly, tail and pec slapped the surface for 45 mins. The youngster appeared to imitate the mother especially when it came to pec slaps. They headed off toward the west when we left them. Totally amazing encounter.

I went out on Dolphin Surveys. We cut across the bay at PG and headed towards Capitola, <b>Monterey Bay CA</b>. On the north side of the "Soquel Hole" we ran into a pod of <b>5 Orcas</b>. The largest one has the cut dorsal fin. When I first saw it I thought it was a submarine conning tower. Anyway, the orcas dove and 4 of them came up at the back of the 20 foot boat - 2 on each side. The photo looking at the blow hole also has the side cleat for the boat bumpers in the left corner of the photo. They bumped the boat and then moved off and kept heading their original direction.
Fortunately they were just curious (or putting us in our place) and not hungry or aggressive. We've seen just about everything crossing the bay but there is something about being in a 20 foot boat and being checked out by Orcas. They sure didn't have to worry about us harassing them. 
<br/>Robert Scoles, Monterey Bay Aquarium volunteer, Monterey, CA 
<br/>And from Alisa Schulman-Janiger, these IDs of the orcas photographed:
Thanks so much for sending on these killer whale pics from yesterday's Dolphin Surveys! Robert saw some well-known transients that frequent Monterey Bay. I call the male "Chopfin" (in photo shown). He is also known as CA217 (N29). He was first photographed in 1998 off of Santa Catalina Island in southern California with the other whale you sent: CA216 (N28). He has been seen as far north as Washington, and as far south as Dana Point, CA. Very few of our killer whale have such damaged fins; he is quite recognizable. Thanks again!

Around <b>two pm</b> we were on a whale watch boat off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> (I believe that we were just south of False Bay) and we encountered maybe a dozen <b>Southern Residents</b>. We were able to positively identify L-85 and I believe L-47 as well. Others on our boat captured images that the naturalist identified as being members of K-pod. The orcas were spread out over an area of maybe 400 yards, but four of them kept getting quite close to our boat, and one even came up directly underneath us.

We were with the <b>superpod </b>on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, and several passengers got pictures of a female breaching. I was taking a look at the pictures afterward, trying to identify the individuals, and I think it was <b>J2 Granny</b>! There's the little curved notch in the middle of her straight dorsal fin, and her right side saddle patch has that long skinny tail reaching forward. I asked several passengers to send me their breaching pictures; so far the only one I've received is this one by Bob Miszuk (above photo). If you open it on full resolution you should be able to see the identifying marks I saw - what do you think? Is that her? If it is, how wonderful to know she's still feeling so spry at her age!

<b>AM </b>Trip on the Western Explorer: Enjoyed small foraging groups in the <b>Salmon Bank Area</b>. Members of <b>all three pods</b> were present with definite ID's of <b>J2, J27, L22, L89, K40</b> and many more. It was great to see the whales in relaxed social groups. There was definitely some foraging going on and JB and I were delighted (as only naturalist could be) to see L89 surface upside down while peeing! It was a first for both of us.
<br/><b>PM </b>Trip on the Western Explorer: I was just reading the reports from the 15th and surprised to see that there was little information regarding the whales activities from when they were at <b>Pt. Lawrence to exiting Cattle Pass</b>. Well everything in between was absolutely amazing! We had second hand information that they had come through Peavine Pass heading West. We had heard that they were very active (going nuts). Captain John Boyd and I aboard the Western Explorer picked them up as they came around Upright head by the Lopez ferry terminal. They were in big groups and very active. Many of them hugged the steep cliffs breaching close to shore. Many more had taken a wider path and let me tell you there was no break in the action. It was countless breaches, cartwheels, spyhops, tail slaps, belly flops, you name it it was happening! This continued for the hour that we were with them as they rounded Flat Point and headed into <b>San Juan Channel</b>. The Soundwatch crew were champions as they quickly addressed as many boats as possible in this busy channel. We only ID'd a few whales during this amazing encounter, but definitely members of L and K pods including <b>L-72</b>, and <b>K-12</b>, and <b>K-34</b>. As we started to head home we got another glimpse of the whales going by <b>Goose Island</b> and then exiting Cattle Pass.

Lazy, hazy days of summer - seems our spread out <b>Southern Residents</b> picked up on that as they foraged near <b>Salmon Bank</b> around <b>1.30 pm</b>. Ruffles (<b>J1</b>) passed by on a mission as did Cappucino (<b>K21</b>), while a Mum and baby lolled together in the kelp. This gentle, intimate scene was every bit as rewarding to see as any acrobatic activity.

Dave Robinson called in a report of about <b>20 orcas</b>, <b>1-2 pm</b>,heading south in groups of 3-4, 50-100' off <b>Pt. Lawrence ,Orcas Island</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
You probably already have this information, but we saw, from Pt. Lawrence, <b>Orcas Island</b>, at <b>1-1:30 pm 18-20 orcas</b>, heading south down Rosario Strait, 30-50 ft. off Pt. Lawrence. They were spyhopping, breaching, fluke slapping, flipper slapping, a lot of porpoising--animals were cruising along in groups of 1 to 4-5 in groups, separated by about 30 seconds. They didn't appear to be feeding, just traveling through the area. Males, females, juveniles; there were at least two large males, dorsals around 6 ft. We've never seen whales in this area before--but we don't hike out to Pt. Lawrence often.

Amidst all the fun with whales (orcas) today, we just found a lone <b>minke whale</b> foraging off of <b>hannah heights</b> approx <b>4:40</b>. Several boats in the area stopped to watch at a very respectful distance - nice to have a whale in the area as the residents are further south this afternoon.

This <b>Gray whale</b> seems to be enjoying the scenery over on the Canadian side, particularly the Chatham and <b>Discovery Islands</b> of late. He/she has been seen frequently, but not always, along the <b>Oak Bay</b> waterfront of Vancouver Island, and as far as the harbour entrance to Victoria for the past month or more. It appears to be healthy and able to dodge all the summer traffic, of boats and Kayaks. It is a relatively slow moving animal that enjoys hanging about in kelp beds these days.

Cheryl Rose called Orca Network to report a sighting of <b>5 Transients</b> near <b>Mittlenach Island, BC</b> (middle of northern Georgia St.).

To return home after the 3.30pm Ocean Magic trip out of Victoria which was simply "heavenly" by the way, and turn on the <b>hydrophones </b>and be greeted with these extraordinary sounds at <b>7.30pm</b>, is all rather intoxicating. Not only did we have this super encounter with approximately 89 Southern Resident whales coming in from the west in what is called the 'Super-pod ' experience (but they first had another experience with some <b>Transient orcas</b> - see below). From that encounter we connected with some of the <b>J's and L's </b>off <b>Trial Island</b> traveling fairly swiftly. We then checked out the <b>Gray Whale</b> that is hanging out between Chatham and <b>Discovery Islands</b>. Finally came the whole <b>Southern Resident</b> procession across the bottom of <b>Haro Strait</b>. It appeared to be many members of <b>Js, Ks, and Ls.</b> AMAZING. Imagine late tonight, as these Orca play and socialize under a dark sky filled with the Perseid meteor shower, August's famous 'shooting stars'. If only we could be there to watch the 'water show '. To think we had three different types of whale in one trip. One can't beat that especially in calm, sunny weather!

Last night around <b>7:45pm</b>, we were watching some harbor porpoises milling about a mile east of <b>Iceberg Point on Lopez</b> when we got a rare treat - a harbor porpoise breach! I'm not sure why, but one of the porpoises decided to leap completely clear of the water, as if one of its partners had goosed it right as it was coming up to breathe. Pretty darn expressive for our normally self-controlled friends.

Orca Network got a call today from Jake McMaster, to report a sighting from about <b>700 miles west of the Columbia River</b>, at 46.40N by 140.130W. They saw a <b>single male orca</b>, at around <b>8 pm</b>. They said it was eating something, but they couldn't tell what. They tried to take pictures but didn't get anything. 
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson IDd the <b>Transients </b>seen at the mouth of the inner Harbour of <b>Victoria </b>, as the <b>T101's and T102</b>. They came into the harbour and skulked along both sides of the Ogden Point Breakwater. Curiously a man in a Kayak was on the outside edge of this breakwater among the kelp beds and he was watching them as they approached. He must have seen them swim beneath his kayak. What a thrill or was it a heart pounding experience. We will never know!

Turn Point Lighthouse, <b>Stuart Island</b>, was the place to be for land based viewing today as numerous members of <b>J pod</b> (including Ruffles, Blackberry, Granny, new Mums and babies) passed by at around <b>2.00 pm</b> in a flurry of activity. Spyhops, breaches, cartwheels, porpoising, it was a joy to watch. After attending last Sunday's 40th commemoration of the Penn Cove captures, which decimated the numbers of our Southern Residents, it was a salutary moment to see Ruffles, who escaped capture more than once due to his size, escorting his family around the point.

Out on the Kenai Explorer en route to the Northwest Glacier, we first encountered <b>Dalls Porpoise</b> playfully riding our bow. Soon after a Mother <b>Humpback </b>and Calf on the North Side of Cheval Island near Aialik Bay traveling and feeding. A few minutes later as we headed further out into the Gulf, a <b>Pod of Orcas</b> that stayed with us for awhile. I saw my first calf and a newborn of the season, and the youngster was quite exuberant and did some breaches for us. I love baby orca Breaches. After spending time with the glacier which was quite active yesterday, we headed towards the Chiswell Islands, and in the far distance I noticed some tall blows. What a blessing and we encountered a Mother <b>Fin Whale</b> and her calf. Fin Whales are challenging to observe as their dive times can be up to 45 minutes with those huge lungs so we kept our expectations low. Luckily they came up fairly close to the boat, she was huge, it takes forever to see their dorsal fin, yet it was really a special experience for everyone on board to see the second largest creature on this planet.

As soon as we arrived on scene, a bit north of <b>False Bay</b>, we saw <b>orcas </b>mating, truly an appropriate thing to point out on the 'adults only' Kittiwake. We also saw them breaching, cartwheeling, and lunging. There were several calves in the group and everywhere you looked there was a looming fin of an adult male; a relief because quite recently, there were only 11 adult males for a population of 85 or so. This led to a limited amount of inbreeding, a trend we hope will be reversed as teenage males reach their prime.

I got a call from Ivan that he had found whales at Hein Bank, so I was feeling much more optimistic for the <b>afternoon </b>trip. When we arrived off of <b>False Bay</b>, the whales were quite spread in groups of 2-3s, and we found a couple of youngsters who were oblivious to our presence and proceeded to chase each other about, rolling around the surface, spyhopping each other. One was a young male, but when he rolled upside down at the surface, you could plainly see he was a, well, "happy" male whale in the presence of a female!! In other words, a tiny sea snake! Later we had not one, not two, but 3 opportunities to watch J2 Granny spyhop! J1 Ruffles was showing off how to hunt for salmon the tide rips off of Bellevue Point. We also got to see J19 and her calf J41 as they passed by, along with J27 Blackberry off in the distance and J30 Riptide.

Jan Holmes of Whidbey Island called to share a whale report from on board the Western Prince. They saw 2 groups of 6 <b>orcas </b>off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, then another group of 5 with a calf. Some of the whales they saw were J1, J2, &amp; J27, and one of the calves came over to the boat and looked right up at them, then swam under the boat. They had traveled all the way up San Juan Island so ended up circumnavigating the entire island for the trip home.

Finally had a chance to check in to see "who" it was we saw from the Keystone ferry Mon evening (<b>7:15pm</b>). I can't believe no one has said anything about the little group near Port Townsend. The PT Keystone boat was heading across the shipping lanes back to Whidbey, about midway out, a <b>"pair" of orcas</b> made their way in the opposite direction across the lanes, and the ferry cpt announced that they hadn't seen any all summer out there. (It's a wonder the boat didn't list over with everyone dashing to the side!) They made a bee-line over toward Port Townsend, and we could see them blowing just inside Point Wilson. When I looked at my pictures later, it looks like there is at least one more besides the 2, and perhaps a 4th.

Joel Kawahara called Orca Network to report a sighting of <b>4 orcas</b>, including 1 male &amp; 3 females, while salmon fishing at 44 46N, 124 19W (N of Waldport, S. of <b>Newport, OR</b>). He was fishing for salmon but there weren't many around, but lots of anchovies &amp; sardines in the area. 
<br/>*<br/>
Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster encountered <b>K's and L's</b> spread out in mixed groups just south of <b>Bellevue Point</b> at <b>4:44 p.m.</b> (48° 31.443 N; 123° 10.416W). The whales were traveling south. We continued down to Eagle Point and encountered more mixed groups of J's and L's. The encounter ended west of Lime Kiln State Park at 7:01 p.m. (48° 30.007N; 123° 09.232 W).

<b>Orca </b>calf and adult (L Pod?) SW off of <b>San Juan Island</b>, <b>3 PM</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
Whales north near <b>Vancouver</b>, just south of the Vancouver airport, and lots of them! Superpod with lots of breaching, tail slaps and of course, mating! After hanging out with the whales we went and found <b>White Sided dolphins</b>!
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>L's Mega, Mystery, and Crewser</b> again, traveling with Indigo heading south along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> just south of Eagle Point. Crewser and Mystery were traveling so close together that until we did some careful identification we thought it was just one male. 
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist, Victoria Clipper III 
<br/>*<br/>
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries found the pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> at <b>4:30 pm</b>, hunting off <b>Bainbridge Island</b>. It appeared they were in the process of making a kill, with no direction of travel. They left them about <b>6:10</b> off Kingston, in mid-channel, headed north. It's the same male and juvenile and probably the same four that were there July 28 (T101, T101A, T101B, and T102). They observed one predation of probably a seal.
<br/>*<br/>
We were very surprised on our way home to meet up with <b>T102 </b>traveling with another male and a female, northbound just south of <b>Edmonds</b>. Just before we spotted them we noticed a number of harbor porpoises moving quickly, perhaps trying to avoid becoming a meal!
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist, Victoria Clipper III
<br/>*<br/>
At approximately <b>1330 </b>hours, I witnessed via my binoculars, <b>3 Orcas</b> (one seemed smaller than the others) heading south along the eastern shore (maybe 300 yards offshore) of Puget Sound beginning at about the area where Talbot Road and Olympic View Drive meet in <b>Edmonds</b>. I witnessed for the next 20-30 minutes heading along the shoreline before I discontinued watching them before they reached the Edmonds Ferry dock.
<br/>Doug
<br/>*<br/>
About a 1/4 mile north of <b>Edmonds </b>Ferry, just this side of mid channel, we spotted two older males, 2 females and one smaller <b>Orca </b>together surfacing in a steady pattern heading south. Once they past the ferry dock we drove to Marina Beach (South Edmonds) and they were just passing, much more spread out. We watched them surface until they were near the peninsula nearing what we think is Jefferson Point? just east of Indianola. We left them at <b>2:30</b>, they were still heading south (with a couple of Harbor Porpoise in tow).

We were out in the midst of the <b>superpod </b>in <b>Haro Strait</b>, where we spotted <b>Ruffles </b>in a group with several others (Samish and Se-Yi'-Chn might have been among them), and later Mega, Mystery and Crewser from L-pod.

<br/>*<br/> 
In the <b>morning </b>I observed <b>L22 </b>chase down a harbor porpoise neonate. L94 and her calf, L113 joined in the final drowning of the porpoise. All three whales left the neonate floating dead. It appeared to be unmarked.

<br/>*<br/>
We saw several animals westbound in the <b>Juan de Fuca strait</b> on route from San Juan Island during the <b>3:30pm</b> Ocean Magic trip. Lots of activity and a TON of breaching! Almost impossible to see it all never mind get photos of it all. L41 &amp; L74 were in high pursuit of salmon giving passengers an awesome perspective. Big rollers that day so I was amazed that I managed to get what I got ! If you want to see more from the trip you can see it on this blog;

We encountered<b> K's</b> traveling north off <b>Cattle Point</b> (48° 43.519 N; 123° 96.3 W) at <b>11:53 a.m</b>. The whales were spread out in groups traveling quickly. We followed the K's to Bellevue point (48° 52.324 N; 123° 16.49 W) where they turned south at <b>2:42 p.m</b>. Shachi was further south down the west side of the island with mixed groups of <b>L's and J's</b>.

<b>3 pm: Orcas</b> just now beginning to <b>call </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> - looks like the Center for Whale Research had them off the S. end of San Juan Island earlier this morning and is following them north. <b>4 pm</b>: Beginning to hear calls at OrcaSound hydrophones now - So. residents heading north up the west side of San Juan Island.

Ship's Log: Tremendous <b>Orcas </b>encounter this <b>morning </b>just outside <b>Cattle Pass</b>. Super Pod breaching, spy hopping, tail slapping all around us! What a day after anchoring next to schooners Martha and Suva with these young woman leaders and mentors. Pictures to follow!

A treat of an after supper whale sighting this evening. Around <b>7:30 pm</b>, <b>J pod</b> headed east through <b>Active Pass</b>. They were so spread out, it took almost an hour for them to go by. Some tail slaps and spy hops (and more great photos we don't have room for today - look for them in future reports!).

We had a wonderful (and sunny!) day with some of the <b>Southern Residents</b> today, 2 miles south of <b>Eagle Cove (SJI)</b>. From <b>11:30-12:30</b> we hung out with J-pod (J-1 was easily identified among them) and perhaps some members of K &amp; L. They were breaching and belly flopping, tail lobbing (3 times in a row, on multiple occasions), spyhopping, and rolling. A few calves were porpoising. Whales were in all directions around us for the full hour without us motoring anywhere. A truly fantastic and intimate day with them! 
<br/>Deb McArthur, Naturalist, Victoria Clipper III 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6am </b>pass-by at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. We saw some J's, L53, and L87. It was a beautiful morning with good vocals on the hydrophone. 
<br/>Katie Jones, San Juan Island (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
Started the morning with <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln</b> about <b>6 am</b> as we readied to head up to SJI to join Capt Jim Maya. While first exploring Lime Kiln Park we heard reports at <b>12:45pm</b> from Interpretive Center of<b> J and L pods</b> off <b>Eagle Cove</b> now heading north. Headed out on Maya's 1:30pm run and needn't go far before we are in the company of Orca. J1-Ruffles just off the westside heading north. At least 3 females nearby closer to shore, Capt Jim thought one must be J2-Granny. Mostly heading north in a resting motion. Made our way south past CWR, County Park and Lime Kiln, spotting whales all along the west side. Maya mentioned J17, J27 Blackberry, J26 Mike and K21 Cappuccino. The entire 2/12 hours we must have seen up to 20 different Orca along the westside from north of Edward's point and leaving them at the entrance to Snug Harbor. Breaches, porpoising, feeding, a spyhop, lot's of pec and tail flapping.

We saw a <b>Minke whale, porpoise, a few dolphins</b> (while circumnavigating San Juan Island).
<br/>Sarah Schmidt Berger (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Also spotted today was a <b>minke </b>whale in Spieden Channel, and along Haro Strait we saw a <b>Dall's porpoise</b>, and a mother harbor porpoise and calf.
<br/>Heather Hill
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Laurie and Jessica Brooks reporting a sighting of two <b>Harbor porpoise</b> off <b>Biz Pt</b>, Fidalgo Island at <b>3 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Today the [orcas] were also doing pretty much what they were doing in July--the west side shuffle! Whales had been doing the shuffle since <b>early AM</b>, and as we were heading to Cattle Point, we heard the whales were heading towards Lime Kiln again. But we were not very concerned as with the big flood tide coming in, we knew the whales were likely to head back towards <b>False Bay</b>. And that's exactly where we found them! First we saw J27 Blackberry, who was doing his J1 Ruffles imitation by hanging quite aways offshore from the rest of the whales. Eventually we were able to find a nice little group of whales off to themselves, so we slowly made our way over. We spotted J39 Mako along with J34 Doublestuff. More whales were closer to shore, but we were staying outside of the 1/4 mile west side buffer zone, so I couldn't get any IDs. J39 and J34 were being very energetic, with lots of chasing and playing around, spyhops, and then J34 did a beautiful breach. You could see that this young male is starting to get the characteristic growing dorsal fin along with the very paddle-like pectoral fins. The whales continued their foraging as we left them still milling around False Bay. We saw lots of bait fish along with several salmon jumping, so perhaps this is why these whales have hung out here for the last 3 days?

Was out on Odessey and circumnavigated San Juan Island. We saw representatives from <b>J, K and L pods</b>. An absolutely amazing day. Orcas are so agile, fast and powerful.
<br/>Sarah Schmidt Berger (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
We encountered some <b>Southern Residents</b> just south of Lime Kiln at approx. <b>3:30</b>, heading north. First to pass by us was J32 Rhapsody, followed by a tight grouping of J17 Princess Angeline and her youngest J44 (male), her other two daughters J28 Polaris and J35 Tahlequah, and her new grandcalves, J46 (mom J28) and J47 (mom J35). The 3 calves were rolling on top of one of the adults backs, then they separated off together for a bit of play and juvenile antics playing in kelp, breaching, etc (see photo above). The 3 calves were all born within a year of each other, and they all belong to J17's subgroup so they likely spend most of their time swimming together. Must be a fun family to grow up in, I bet these youngsters will be very close with each other as they continue to grow! Next to pass by (close enough to get an ID) was K21 Cappuccino, followed by J30 Riptide. (Report continued below, under Minkes).

LOUD calls on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at <b>7:24am</b>, getting fainter now at 7:30am.
<br/>Alisa Brooks, Shoreline WA 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0519: Lime Kiln</b> heard faint <b>k pod calls</b>; 0521 - became louder; 0525 - became faint; 0532 - became louder - multiple s-33, s-16, s-40 (different calls as well, maybe traveling with another pod?); 0620 - became REALLY REALLY LOUD - clicking, echolocating, many many different calls; 0732 - became fainter; 0740 - gone.
Checked OrcaSound hydrophone - didn't hear them there. They were back between 0759 and got quiet at 0820 again at Lime Kiln.
