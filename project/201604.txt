<br/>
<b>T065B1</b> at close range yesterday in <b>Haro Strait</b>. T065A (R) &amp; offspring in Haro Strait. The T065A's and B's were less than a mile from Humpback Big Mama and her calf and were headed towards each other, but the transients didn't bother the humpbacks. The <b>T065A's and B's</b> had been submerged on a deep dive and surfaced right next to us. This 5 yr old's dorsal fin is already sprouting. I think he's going to be a big boy. -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpback Big Mama BCY0324 with her airborne newest calf (no. 6)</b>. -Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today out on the Island Whaler with <b># 49 patch and # 383 in Elger Bay</b> moving south. -Terica Ginther

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Big Mama</b>, a pioneer, one of the first humpbacks to return after a 100 years of absence to the Salish Sea. We are excited and smoking a cigar because she is back with a new calf! We believe it to be the 6th. Both Big Mama and her calf were breaching when we sailed to Beaumont Shoals today. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Breaching humpback calf. This is the 2016 calf of the much loved humpback Big Mama</b>. Photographed today in <b>Haro Strait southwest of Lime Kiln</b>. As we (Island Adventures Whale Watching) slowly moved into position both Big Mama and the calf began breaching repeatedly. They breached together at one point but I didn't get shots. The calf breached at least 10 times while Big Mama repeatedly lobbed her flukes. We sat at stand off distance with engines off and watched in amazement. After awhile the acrobatics stopped as quickly as they started and Big Mama moved north up Haro with her calf. The T065A and T065B transient orca were less than a mile away at the time and were headed south but the marine mammal eating orca ignored the humpbacks. Great to see an apparently strong and energetic calf for Big Mama this yr. Shot at 500mm and cropped. -James Gresham

<b>1605 - A pod of Orca (Bigg's killer whales/Transients) with a couple breaching between North side of Orcas and Matia Island </b>heading NW. -David McIntire

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Gray whale reported close to shore at Ebey's Landing, Whidbey Island today</b>, likely feeding. Wondering if it's one of our Northern Puget Sound Grays heading out! Thanks to Karen Bishop for sharing, and solving our mystery. -Wilbur Bishop

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:28 p.m. - Spotted. Grey whale feeding in the shallows</b>. Approx .5 miles north of parking lot. (<b>Ebey's Landing</b>). -David Stern

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Our stranding network received a report of a<b> small whale (or other marine mammal) traveling north at Ebey's Landing</b>, Central Whidbey Island, a few feet from the shore, heading north, near parking lot area.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0630 hours: Ferryboat crew of the Issaquah and Sealth report a gray whalelocated 1/2 mile north of Vashon Head</b> at LAT. North 47.31.08- LONG. West 122.28.02 The crew reports the whale appears emaciated and the lethargic and are concerned about its welfare. No pictures available. -John Rogstad, WSF

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:44 a.m. -</b> slow steady pace southbound. Shallow surfaces in 3-4s every 8-10 minutes in glassy water. No fluking though one does arch on last surface. Carkeek would be next place for shore viewing...they are probably almost due west of there.
<br/><b>11:25 a.m. - definitely 2 humpbacks</b>! Now traveling in tandem <b>mid channel sightline Richmond Beach and Faye Bainbridge</b>. Southbound. (as viewed from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park)
<br/><b>11:15 a.m. - </b> again caught just a glimpse of a 2nd whale west of mid channel and east of 1st whale. Shallow surface by whale no. 2.
<br/><b>11:05 a.m. -</b> caught a glimpse corner of binoculars, pretty positive it is a <b>humpback off Jefferson Head/Indianola</b>. Will confirm shortly. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:14 a.m. - Two whales (humpback?)</b> just surfaced off A<b>pple Tree Point in Kingston heading south</b>!! HUGE....and amazing. Only surfaced once so wasn't able to get a picture. -Sara Frey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

...We were promised rain but were lucky - we headed out to find <b>gray whales and right off Camano</b>, directly opposite Langley, we found <b>#44 Dubknuck</b> feeding along Camano's shoreline, heading slowly north. After watching him feed on his side with one pectoral fin and half of his tail visible, he then come out to deeper water and we saw his tail fluke several times. We then headed south towards <b>Hat/Gedney Island </b>and found <b>#723 Lucyfer</b> feeding along the southern shallow banks. He was very visible near the surface, we could see his entire body in the shallow water. Heading back to port, #44 had turned south and we saw him again! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>J34 in Sidney Channel in the afternoon</b>. -Mark Malleson
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 p.m. - Left J16's off Ripple Island heading for San Juan Channel</b>. Met them at Blunden as the sun was setting. At first they zig zagged and then doubled back and headed towards Johns Pass. It was after 8:30 and getting dark but we wanted to see where they were going to go!
<br/><b>6:45 p.m. - J16's nearing Blunden, pointed at Turn</b>. -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
I have been waiting fourteen years to have <b>J Pod</b> come through <b>Sansum Narrows which divides Maple Bay and Cowichan Bay</b>. This is a historic travel route for the Southern Resident Killer Whales. Since the downfall of the Cowichan River Chinook Salmon run in the 1980's the southern residents rarely come into Cowichan Bay. I was lucky enough to find them just entering Sansum Narrows resting but as soon as they got to the mouth of Cowichan Bay the fireworks started. This encounter made my year! -Simon Pidcock

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hard Core. We used the moderate to strong winds and the big ebb and flood to cover serious ground and watch serious whales. <b>Sidney Channel - J34, Doublestuf</b>, continual breaches and cartwheels expressed the power of the day. His mom, J22, similarly cartwheeled and even the kids were having fun. Vocalizing while fishing and exuberant with the exciting whitecaps. A thrill and an honor to sail in their presence. We broke away to meet the breakaway group, the <b>J16's, in the white caps of Blunden Island, Canada</b>. They surprised us by turning towards San Juan Channel with us as we plowed a beam reach homeward through sunset. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:18 a.m. - Unidentifiable whale in shipping lane off of Vashon Island</b> drifting northwards towards Blake island. Drifting in surface and blowing occasionally. Hope it is not in distress. -Terry Blumer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 a.m. - Humpback or grey whale in between Lincoln Park and Vashon Island</b>, main shipping channel. Floating, have seen some blows. -Sharon Blumer

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 27</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>0845 - viewed from land. Location 2km. SE of Comox Ferry terminal, approx. 1 1/2 km offshore. Best estimate, 7 Unidentified killer whales</b>. We have seen much more Orca activity in the last year than in any of the previous 12 years we have lived here. -Ron Ulmi 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Anna Gullickson of Kenmore Air just sent in this report: A fellow pilot just spotted a pod of some type of whale about 5 miles South of Smith Island at 3:36 pm. She thinks maybe Fin whales? She thinks there were about 4 of them. They are dark grey, almost black w/ a bit of a white understreak. They were feeding on herring balls w/ the seagulls and that is how she spotted them.

<br/>
<b>J16 &amp; her 16 month-old daughter J50</b> -Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research

...The morning began with <b>J pod calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone around 0630</b> and a distant visual sighting by Jeanne Hyde a short time later of several dorsal fins and a breach <b>east of Beaumont Shoal on the Canadian side of the border in Haro Strait</b>. It took a little more than two hours before the whales came slowly past the Center for Whale Research headed northwest bucking an ebbing tide...See full Encounter 36 Report. -Center for Whale Research

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

After twenty years of watching these whales one of those magic moments I had been waiting for finally arrived. Today I was able to visit with <b>all of Jpod as they traveled through beautiful Active Pass</b>. It was truly an inspiring, humbling experience. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J52 "Sonic" looking small compared to his uncle, J26 "Mike"!</b> -Gary Sutton,

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J Pod this morning</b>, going north past my neighborhood on <b>Mitchell Point, San Juan Island</b>. They were a ways off shore. -Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:13 p.m. - Hearing calls (again, still?) on the OrcaSound hydrophone</b> on NW San Juan Island! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:54 a.m. - repeated calls including S4s- on OS.</b>
<br/><b>9:40 a.m. -  whistling, calls intermittent, some loud -on OS</b>.
<br/><b>9:20 a.m. -  switched to OrcaSound hearing loud calls and echolocation</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:17 a.m. - Jpod vocals and lots of echolocation on Orcasound</b> hydro right now! Calls are distant. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:42 a.m. - intermittent faint calls, echolocation steady.
<br/>8:21 a.m. vocals still faint, now hearing echolocation
<br/>8:08 a.m. -  distant/faint J pod vocals on Lime Kiln.</b> -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:08 a.m. - hearing orcas on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. -Althea Leddy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:53 - 4Ts going S from Detwiller Pt. to Porlier Pass</b>. (Georgia St, SE of Nanaimo). -Ron Bates

Today was just lovely! Caught up with the <b>T65As (first time this year!) T49As and T49C....These guys cruised over to Turn Point Lighthouse</b> on Stuart island. This is perhaps one of my most favorite places to photograph whales with backlit blows and pure green water! -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spotted <b>at least 4 orcas around 12:30pm today while on the ferry from Sídney, B.C to Friday Harbor</b>, WA. Lots of dorsal fins. Happened about 30 min into the route on the north side of the boat. -Angela Staiger

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>North Puget Sound Grays - 3 pm trip</b>, and we had a full load on Sound Water Stewards' fundraising cruise. We dodged the heavier rain showers and found gray whale <b>#723 Lucyfer just south of Hat/Gedney Island</b>, traveling back and forth along the shallow banks. Then to our delight, <b>#49 Patch</b> appeared to show us his very distinctive "patch" and tail fluke, what a treat! Heading north, we then found <b>#21 Shackelton</b> - the first whale to be documented in Possession Sound (by Cascadia Research Collective), way back in 1990!!.... -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Probably gray whale #44</b>. Couldn't confirm ID but whoever it was, was heading north from Possession when we saw him. there's also <b>3 others northwest of Gedney- #49, 723 and 383</b> were all together. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Spouting spotted @ 12:15pm Clinton going to Mukilteo ferry crossing</b>...spouting spotted to the north of the ferry. (No dorsal fins seen, so guessing not orcas.) -Jeff Reoch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 p.m. -</b> Today while sailing we thought we changed our course a bit to avoid a log or rock and were pretty surprised to find that when we passed it was actually <b>a grey whale</b>. We were concerned because it didn't appear to be moving aside from a little bobbing with the water, which was quite calm. <b>Southwest of Kingston </b>pretty close to shore, at about 47.772214,-122.469870. We had it in sight for only about 5 minutes. -Caitlin Gibson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:07 p.m. - There is a whale between Jefferson Head and Kingston </b>floating on the surface moving very slowly. At first we thought he was dead, but he appears to be alive. I'm a newbie at this so not sure what else to report. -Nancy Langwith

<b>Transient Orca super pod all traveling together - 65A's, 49A's, 123's, 65B, 65B1 and others </b>were making their way to the group. -Brian Goldberg

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

EPIC day with the <b>T49A's, T65A's, T65B's, and T123's! A little ways north of Protection Island</b>. Incredible action from these guys: pirouettes, double breaches, super spyhops, sea snakes, and mid-air barrel rolls. Here are images of orcas defying gravity. -Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transient Orcas socializing. North of Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. -Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

...Later that morning we got a report of killer whales <b>near the mouth of Puget Sound between Admiralty Inlet and Port Townsend</b>. When we got on scene I quickly identified the commonly known <b>T065As, T065Bs, T049As, T049C, and T123s</b>. I had not seen T065B and T065B-1 in quite some time, so that was exciting! I just love these large groupings of mammal-hunting killer whales (Bigg's/transients) we see in the spring! I wonder what initiates such groupings, but I suspect the reason is ecological. We saw hundreds of breaches and displays of social behavior. This is usually very rare for these types of killer whales because they need to be very quiet and stealthy in order to exploit their intelligent prey. They must have all had very full bellies ... I think the orcas spent more time out of the water than in it! We saw back flips, spyhops, cartwheels, breaches, head-stands, and heaps of tactile behavior.... -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Incredible encounter with <b>3 transient pods in Admiralty Inlet</b> . -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:17 p.m. - they are steadily traveling NW on their way out of Admiralty inlet</b>. Harder to see now - will be out of sight from Whidbey soon.
<br/><b>11:49 a.m. - At Fort Ebey state park, can see the pod mid channel</b>. I've seen some crazy surface activity in the few minutes I got here. Water like glass and easy to see. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:12 a.m. - Transient orcas at Ebeys Landing</b> northbound. Out on Redhead, amazing activity and vocalizations. -Trevor Tillman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
With much better weather conditions than originally forecast, <b>gray whales #49 (Patch), #383 and #723 put in an appearance between Gedney Island and Everett</b> in search of their favorite food source, ghost-shrimp. For much of the time #383 and #723 were traveling together, with all three whales changing direction frequently and intent on feeding. Just getting on with life. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:04 p.m. -</b> Just got back in from gray whale trip from Edmonds with Puget Sound Express. Watched <b>two gray whales north of Everett</b> fantastic morning...<b>Gray whale #383 was north of Everett</b>. -Karen Knight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We encountered <b>BCY0160 "Heather" the humpback right outside of our harbor early on. (Snug Harbor)</b> I'm grateful that we have these gentle giants in the Salish Sea again. They were nearly eradicated by one whaling station here at the turn of the century but are making a huge comeback, known affectionately as the "humpback comeback"! This is Heather's 14th consecutive year here according to researchers. Interestingly enough, she was the last humpback I saw here last November. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

.....As if the day wasn't epic enough we also encountered <b>a Minke whale</b> (second smallest baleen whale in the world) on the way back to our harbor. (<b>Snug Harbor</b>) As Jared Towers documents in his 2014 publication on seasonal movements and ecological markers as evidence for common minke whale migration, I also observed numerous cookiecutter shark scars on this individual which was very interesting! This individual must have just gotten back to its summer range... -Heather MacIntyre

<b>T49C and his nephew T49A1 swim among the Penn Cove Mussel Farm's rafts</b>, and nearly within arms reach of awe struck staff. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:54 p.m. - Admiralty Inlet - Four or five Orcas</b> headed north at a quick pace! One very large fin present. <b>East side of Foulweather bluff</b>. We are on a sailboat in the south end of Admiralty Inlet, about a half mile offshore. Orcas were between us and the Kitsap Penninsula. -Carrie Selting Carrie Selting

A couple of big boys, including <b>T49C near Penn Cove Mussel rafts</b>. -Rachel Haight
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:15 p.m. - 4-6 Orcas in Penn Cove</b> heading east past wharf at <b>3:15 </b>Friday. Two males, maybe 2-4 others. Traveling east. -Maribeth Crandell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:40 p.m. - Just got a call, orcas are BACK in Penn Cove!</b> ..going toward the mussel docks. Maybe 3? -Bonnie Gretz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:17 p.m. - </b>Sweet, yep they are heading to the pass. The tide should be coming back in around <b>1:30pm</b>, last year they were at the pass during the same conditions. -Drea Park

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage  - Nature in the raw... Shortly after leaving Langley marina, we caught up with <b>two groups of transient orcas (marine mammal eating orcas), south of Camano Head</b>. The whales milled for a while before becoming more spread out as they picked up the pace towards Port Susan, until diverted by a Pacific harbor seal crossing their path. A short, intense pursuit followed, but this lucky seal got away! We left the orcas continuing north as we headed back towards Camano Head, where we spotted the heart-shaped blow of<b> a gray whale, #44 (Dubknuck)</b> traveling south - away from the orcas. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Trip report - In record breaking temperatures we headed out to find whales - the water was so flat and beautiful we could see for miles. Wasn't too long until we found<b> #44 Dubknuck and #49 Patch </b>feeding side by side, very <b>near to Camano Head</b>. They were in shallow water, it was so calm we could even see them underwater, a most unusual sight. We then headed<b> further south and found #383 and #723 Lucyfer</b>, also feeding together <b>by Hat/Gedney Island</b>. They too were in shallow water, too shallow for any fluke dives. We really didn't want to return to port because it was such a wonderful day being out on the water. But - we had to. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

We had a wonderful encounter with the <b>J16's south of Secretary Island (near Sooke)</b>! They had been picked up by Ocean Magic and we were the second boat on scene and soon identified the J16's but could see other Orcas further to the west. We were the only boat on scene and watched the J16's playing around with each other being very tactile. They were slowly heading back west but in no great hurry. It was great to see J50 &amp; J52 playing together. -Andrew Lees, Five Star WW

Gotta love the baby face! We were with the <b>T86As, T37, and T124A1</b> today! Our captain/owner of Western Prince Whale &amp; Wildlife Tours of sighted them by land! Such a special treat! I had not seen the T86A's since March of 2013! It appears that T86A has a new calf, but waiting to hear confirmation from the Center for Whale Research. Her last known calf was T86A3 which is to the left of this image with the large nick up top of the dorsal fin. So curious to hear what they have been up to the last couple years and how long they might stick around! -Traci Walter

Received a call at <b>7:00 pm </b>from Rob and Marilyn Hrycenko,<b> Honeymoon Bay</b>, to say that whales were passing their window (again) and <b>heading into Holmes Harbor for the 4th day in a row.</b>... By the time we arrived at the Beachfire dock at 7:15 pm, the whales were in our sights powering through the waves and whitecaps. About 500 yards from the dock they seemed to have a change of plan, turned and went back north! Difficult to say how many whales were present due to sea conditions and fading light, but Marilyn thought she saw about ten. The best ID shot we obtained shows Doublestuf (J34) and maybe that's Cookie (J38) ahead of him. These whales are certainly setting quite a pace for us landlubbers trying to keep track of them. -Sandra Pollard &amp; Richard Snowberger

We first saw the<b> J17s and J22s coming up to the north end of Holmes Harbor just south of Greenbank around 2 pm.</b> They were pointed north when we saw them but not going anywhere, just logging and spyhopping. Within minutes they turned south and headed into Holmes Harbor for the second time today and where they were yesterday, but where Residents are very rarely seen. We went a few miles south and stopped at Holmes Harbor Vista and watched them pass slowly, continuing southward. We then went to the Holmes Harbor golf course and out on the floating dock just as they came by within 30' of the dock, again slowly, staying close to the surface. They got to between the golf course and the town park, where the depth drops to just a few feet over the mudflats. They continued logging and spyhopping in tight groups for about 20 minutes, then they slowly meandered back northward. We headed back north to the Holmes Harbor yacht club and saw them pass by, still going very slow, for another twenty minutes, then went back to where we started just south of Greenbank, and watched them move slowly northwest toward the beach into very shallow water before turning northward. We then went up to <b>Hidden Beach, just north of Greenbank</b>, and watched as they moved at only a slightly faster pace, <b>northward toward Penn Cove about 6 pm.</b> All members of both matrilines were present and no new babies were seen. Lots of blackmouth salmon, which are the non-migratory Chinook, were reported to be in Saratoga Passage, so possibly they are finding plenty to eat, but they didn't seem to be foraging. Instead they were in tight clusters, intensely socializing the whole time. I won't even venture an explanation of their bizarre behavior. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

What a day! Again, I started the day at Hidden Beach and ended at Hidden Beach. Except today, <b>J pod went back and forth in Holmes Harbor multiple times</b>. They passed close by Dines Point several times and had an incredibly close pass by at the dock at the <b>Holmes Harbor golf course</b>. We also saw an osprey catch a fish, have an eagle chase it, causing the osprey to drop the fish, the eagle tried to get the fish but didn't; two more eagles flew in, and two of them locked talons. No one got a fish, but this moment made me forget about orcas altogether (for a split second!), such a unique sight to witness! It was another beautiful sunny day spent with J pod and orca loving friends. Perfect. -Rachel Haight

Our community near<b> Strawberry Point on Skagit Bay was treated to a gray whale visit</b>, Sunday evening around <b>7PM at high tide</b>. Action packed excitement close to shore. STANDING ROOM ONLY! Viewing first by beach (land), then by boat (sea) a bit later; it simply never gets old &amp; something new to learn. Observing, for the first time a zig zag route/pattern feeding near shore. Angling out to deeper water then angling back into shallow water to feed as gray headed southwest towards Polnell Pt at sunset. Large rocks stick out at low tide/under water at high. Practical explanation on zig zagging? Gray just maneuvering  to avoid the large rocks under water. Best guess :-) -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor

Around 3<b>:30 PM - south Puget Sound a whale went cruising by in front of my house on Glen Acres rd. Vashon</b>. It was heading South. I tried to take a picture, but it looks more like the Loch Ness monster than a whale. It was very close to shore, must have only been in about 20' of water. (from description sounds like emaciated juvenile gray that has been in the sound for several weeks). -Brent  Thompson

Day report and photos: Incredible to see the<b> J-17s on the EAST side of Whidbey Island</b>!!! (slowly moving north from Greenbank Farm). At first we assumed they were transients, but after closer looks at open saddle patches, and especially J-28 Polaris's notched dorsal fin, it was obvious. They were leisurely spy-hopping numerous times, gliding through the glass smooth late afternoon spring sunshine. What a thrill to see them, and of course, the darling babies! -Bonnie Gretz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Day report and phtos: Today was spent chasing <b>J pod up and down the east side of Whidbey</b> - I followed them from noon until just before 8pm. I spotted them at <b>Hidden Beach where they went deep into Holmes Harbor</b>, then traveled north all the way to just south of Penn Cove, last seen at <b>Hidden Beach headed south</b>. I ran into so many orca loving friends along the way, I laughed so much, enjoyed the sunshine, and closed off the night enjoying dinner with beer and friends. Just another day on Whidbey. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Day report and photos: What a dilemma - with whales reported on the west side of Whidbey and then on the east, which way to go? Opting to follow up on the Orca Network report of whales heading south in Saratago Passage on the east side, the day took on many twists and turns. Tracking them proved difficult as <b>they went deep into Holmes Harbor, but they were visible fleetingly at 2:15pm</b> from our doorstep (a rarity indeed). After turning back towards Baby Island, the whales headed north in Saratoga Passage, passing <b>Hidden Beach around 3:30 pm</b> accompanied by Mystic Sea, who observed they were with possibly <b>11 members of J pod</b>. Spy-hops, breaches, and logging behaviors were all seen from shore as the whales moved in leisurely fashion north in calm, clear conditions between <b>4:00 and 5:00 pm</b>, until eventually disappearing from sight in the distance. A truly amazing day to have Southern Residents so close to home. -Sandy Pollard

<b>7:20 p.m. - Pod of Orcas headed South, straight out from Richmond Beach in Shoreline</b>. They were approx. a mile or so east of Port Madison. Maybe 8 or more and at least one male.

Cascadia Research update: A successful effort on the water in N Puget Sound with gray whales today. <b>Encountered all six of the regulars known to have arrived this year (21, 49, 56, 383, 531, and 723)</b>. Deployed two suction-cup attached, multi-sensor dual-video tags on 21 and 723 and these remain on tonight gathering data. Jeremy Goldbogen and Dave Cade from Stanford were working with us today. Two interesting gray whale reports came in during the day. The first was of <b>a very emaciated gray whale seen in the Ballard Locks in Seattle</b> today which got a lot of attention. The second was a photo Mark Malleson sent of <b>a gray whale seen today off Victoria that I immediately recognized as another of Puget Sound regulars (44 or Dubknuck)</b> apparently on route to where we were and which we hope to see tomorrow. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research

Three shades of gray today as we headed out to find whales - gray skies, gray seas, and <b>gray whales</b>, but the water was dead calm and perfect for sighting our local Saratoga whales! We found <b>#723 and #531 along the Snohomish Delta</b>, feeding along the shallow banks, back and forth. We had great looks at them as they fed on their sides, scooping up tiny crustaceans, with pectoral fins appearing to be waving at us. The gray skies turned blue for a short time, before the rain caught us as we headed back to Langley. Another fun day with our local friends -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Another wonderful day on the water today, no April Fool's joke! <b>Three whales were found - starting with #723 feeding along the south side of Gedney/Hat Island, and then #383 and #21 were feeding together near Tulalip shores</b>. Lots of "on their side" feeding behavior and some dives, many looks at #723 and #383's flukes. #21 has a very old injury that prevents him from showing the underside of his tail....well documented, but no known reason for the injury. We were also lucky to spot a flock of Brant geese on their migration to Alaska for their summer breeding. April is starting off well! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
