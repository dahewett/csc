They were <b>off Eagle Point, San Juan Island, at 1525 this afternoon (30th)</b> very spread, and apparently south of Seabird in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca at dark.

South Puget Sound - I watched them for about an hour in <b>Case Inlet south of Herron Island, between 3:30 &amp; 4:30pm</b>, trending south. Not in a hurry, diving for 1-2 minutes at a time, with some changes in direction. There were <b>at least 4 of them</b>: one male and 3 likely females or juveniles.

...At 1218, with 'Big Eyes' I saw <b>distant whales in mid-Haro Strait heading south</b> very spread out and taking long dives.

J26!</b>...See more photos and read full summary report at CWR Encounter 122. -Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Distant whales are always better than no whales, especially this time of year! That's <b>K21 Cappuccino heading down the middle of Haro Strait this afternoon</b>, with stunning clouds and the Olympic Mountains behind him.

Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - North Puget Sound - Of all the years I've been here, I've never seen an Orca in the wild. I carry my camera everywhere I go just in case I hear of a report of whales. I got a text from a friend and left my company and the end of the Apple Cup. Grabbed my camera and son and rushed out the door! We were able to follow <b>5 Orcas from Penn Cove down to Monroe Landing</b>. My pictures aren't perfect, but the experience was amazing. Just listening to my son's adorable screams of excitement and pure joy made the whole experience just wonderful. I am so happy that they have finally returned to our beautiful island and I hope they continue to do so. I will never tire of their beauty and will run out the door every chance I can to see them. -Cynthia Vick Allen 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Then I couldn't stand it,<b> had to follow them to Langley</b> where I lost track of them after hitting up Sandy Point, but I was surely orca blessed today...with some orca healing.

Hello from Henry Island! I so enjoy your updates weekly! Thank you! Is this the right place to report whale sightings? If so my husband and I saw <b>at least 6 humpback whales off Spieden island on Wednesday November 16th at 12:30 pm</b>. We were on our way to Roche Harbor when we saw them blow. We went to investigate and was amazed to see at least 6 humpback feeding over there and by Davidson Head. We lived in Maui for years so had no problem recognizing them. Stunning! Thank you again for your wonderful newsletters! -Dana zia

<b>3:57 p.m. -</b> We just saw a whale! We were taking the main down and saw/heard the blow. He has surfaced several times since then-we saw his back twice. Right now, he seems to be parallel with us. Too far away for photos, unfortunately-we stopped the boat and are sitting here-<b>east of Hat Island in Possession Sound</b>. Wow! That was exciting and unexpected! We are <b>pretty sure it's a humpback</b>. We haven't seen him on a few minutes, so we are going to head back to the Marina. How cool is that?! We are sailing-5.7 knots with jib only. At one point, we think he was only a few hundred yards from our boat. We first saw him around 3:40, heading south. -Sharon Ann Clark

<b>2:30 p.m. - Feeding Humpback Sighting.</b> S/he was a<b>bout half way between the south end of Vashon island and the North tip of Point Defiance park</b>. Surfacing for air for 4 or 5 times, then diving for 4 or 5 minutes at a time, and resurfacing a couple hundred yards out from where last seen. I watched this pattern of behavior for about 90 minutes via kayak. I was viewing the whale at a distance of 100 to 300 yards for this period. At one point early on, the whale seemed to be curious about my actions and came very near the surface, after a long dive, just 20 ft in front of me. I was quite startled and quite elated! It did not appear to break the surface, but stirred up the water in front of me enough to set my kayak a-rocking! -Vince Walzem

<b>October 27 - November 4 - Received 3:52 p.m. - </b>Last Thursday, 27 Oct 16, I noticed there was a<b> single gray or humpback whale</b> outside of where I work.  He/she has been to the<b> East of Smith Island</b> cruising up and down along<b> NAS Whidbey Island</b>. We have seen it every day for the last eight days and he hasn't traveled more than two to five miles up and down the coast. It seems unusual that it hasn't moved on and it's not in a pod. I have worked here for two years and usually the whales just pass through if we see them at all. At first it was great to see it, but now we are worried.  The crab pots were here, and we don't want him to be tangled.  Our address at work is 3675 W Lexington St, Oak Harbor WA 98278. Our Latitude 48.3434 Â and Longitude -122.6814 is for my work. My guess is, it is between 200 and 400 yards off base. If someone could check it out, that would be great. -Sandy Mattingly

I observed the whale from on the water this morning moving north and south (back and forth) in the center area of the Dalco/ Narrows/ Colvos Passages (the area between <b>Point Defiance, Gig Harbor and Vashon Island)</b>. Slow surface rolls and breathing followed by dives. Same patterns I've seen the last several days. Was paddling and did not manage to get any good fluke shots. But a good size and healthy looking whale. -Dean Burke

<b>9:40 a.m. - another large humpback </b>this morning heading south in the same <b>Dalco spot</b>. (around Point Defiance/Owens Beach, Tacoma). -Cathy Baker
