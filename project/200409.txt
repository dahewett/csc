...<b>whales</b> along the west side of San Juan. There were whales from South Beach to the south all the way to Bellevue Point. Mostly heading North. Talked to a couple of captains on-scene, and they told me <b>all 3 pods</b> were around again! 
<br/>John Boyd(JB) 
<br/>Off-Duty Naturalist!
<br/>*<br/>
I started tracking <b>J-pod</b> around <b>10:00 a.m</b>. as they headed north slowly, while foraging. All three pods were moving up island very spread out. By  2:00 p.m. all three pods had moved north past Lime Kiln.  I never did see <b>L12 or L41</b>, so don't know whether the L12's went north. There was a great show at Lime Kiln with about five whales hanging out at the point in the kelp for at least 30 minutes.
<br/>Sharon Grace
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We had heard that the <b>L-12's</b> were off the west side but he had a hunch the rest might be doing the loop and he was right... about 78 whales all to ourselves for quite a while. The whales were pretty fluid, tightening up for a while then spreading out, <b>J's K's and L's</b> all mixing it up together. As we rounded the south end of Lopez and proceeded past Castle Rock, they all exhibited a very interesting percussive display. Almost all of them started to smack the water surface. There were pec smacks (awesome from the bulls), fluke smacks, dorsal fin smacks, backstroke with pec and tail smacks, and breaching all over the place!

<b>September 29, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>The L12's ... came up north just past Hannah Heights, then turned south again. At between <b>2:30 and 3:00 p.m</b>. just north of Eagle Point, the L12's greeted <b>J's, K's and the rest of L pod</b>. They were heading north, apparently after coming through Rosario Strait and around Lopez. For some time before that there had been breaching, cart wheeling, tail slapping, etc. from both groups. After the L12's joined up with the others there was amazing socializing and mating behavior for the next several hours. I was watching from above Hannah Heights for a long time. At one point the behavior was somewhat confusing. Right on the shoreline I saw a group of about 6 to 8 females or immature males rolling around together for about 10 to 15 minutes without any seeming involvement from sprouters or mature males. I was fairly certain that mating should involve both sexes, but I appeared to be mistaken. Finally a sprouter emerged from the depths. About 2 minutes after that L57 appeared, followed about 2 minutes later by L41. Mystery resolved!  Then the males disappeared, the females continued rolling about, and the males reappeared several more times at about five minute intervals.

<b>7:30</b> this morning, <b>Orcas</b> headed north through Open Bay, north west side, San Juan Island. Could have been all of them. Looks like they are headed back up to the Frazer for the day, but who knows.

<b>All three pods</b> passed Limekiln light heading south tonight just <b>after sunset</b>. Reasonably good ids on L-57, J-1, L-55, and J-27.  Very quiet and peaceful passby...no noticable vocalizations. A couple of tail lobs, chin ups, and some kelping.
<br/>Doug McCutchen
<br/>Curator of Facilities
<br/>The Whale Museum
<br/>*<br/>
We had <b>K's and L's</b> moving ever so slowly down Boundary Pass from Waldron towards Stuart Island. As they headed south towards Henry, the whales concentrated on several distinct rips in the current, and then they hit the brakes and logged on the surface for awhile. As we watched, L-78 decided to give us a look-see and passed very close to us.  A couple of surface vocalizations were cool to hear, and as the same unidentified whale got ready to go under water, we got a small chin-up spyhop!

<br/><br/>
We were traveling slowly on our boat from Edmonds at about <b>4:30 PM</b>  and we were about 5 miles south when we spotted a large pod of <b>Orcas</b>. We stopped the boat and the Orcas came to the boat and frollicked around the boat for about 10 minutes. There was at least 6 and they were not traveling in any direction. They appeared to be relatively small but my wife saw a couple of larger whales that did not approach the boat. They were playing and possibly feeding as we also saw salmon jumping out of the water in the area. The Orcas disappeared as quickly as they appeared and we couldn't tell in which direction they headed.
<br/>Mike Harris
<br/>*<br/>
Doug, Jodi, Kelp and I were all doing some work at Lime Kiln today around <b>11:30</b> when we heard whale blows through the fog. We ran up to the top of the light and searched through the mist...heard some incredible vocalizations on SeaSound Radio 89.1 FM and then the first few came into view. Had mostly <b>L's</b> at first (photos for sure of L-32, 85, 25, 41) but then had some <b>J's</b> as well (photos J-26, 16, 35). Amongst the ususal J-clan calls we heard what we could only describe as barnyard braying...they sounded like cows, donkeys, chickens and Dougs says, 'definately a drowning cat'...weird. Lots of lunging and milling near the lighthouse. A fun perspective through the fog and from the light. Many folks at the park were thrilled.

The <b>gray</b> was in Crescent Bay at <b>1015</b>. 5 <b>transients</b> in bound from Sooke in the <b>am</b>. I was not out until 1400 but had <b>J's K's and most of L's</b> in Swanson Ch. going to Active Pass with the <b>L12's</b> in Boundary. Had a <b>Minke</b> off Kelp Reef going south as I was going north and another off Halibut Is. going north as I was going south.

<br/>*<br/>... through the pea soup that blanketed the South end of the islands to emerge near Stuart Island/Turn Point in beautiful sun. Even better, <b>all 3 pods</b> were together for a change, slowly making their way North. The whales were spread out in groups over a distance of about 3/4 of a mile, and we had a nice visit with L Pod. As we were heading back towards Turn Point to look at the beautiful lighthouse, we saw the L-12's lurking in the bull kelp beds.

<b>J's, K's, and most of L's</b> were off Pile Point this morning around <b>8 AM.</b>  By <b>11:30</b>, they were passing Turn Point (Stuart Island) heading up Swanson Channel to Active Pass.

My brother was on the <b>4 pm</b> ferry travelling from Vancouver to Victoria, he said he saw about 30 <b>killer whales</b> in Active pass acting social - they were spy hopping. (<i>sounds like J's, K's &amp; most of L's as reported above - sb</i>)

While sitting atop Iceberg Point on Wednesday night at <b>5:15 pm</b>, a group of about 30+ <b>orcas</b> passed in about 4 different small groups and spent at least the next hour breaching and spyhopping from 50 yards to 1/2 mile out.

I was awaken by calls: "<b>ORCAS</b> are here, ORCAS are here....sooo very close for the San Juan Is. camping-ground. The L12s, so near and yet in very peaceful and serene ocean-waters, at  <b>7:30am</b>.

It started off with <b>T31</b> (was the general consensus) at the Chain Is. (BC) hunting through the rocks and then heading west along the golf course. We then picked him up again, on our second trip, about 3 miles south of Beacon Hill Park zig zagging west towards William Head, he was hard to watch with long dives, so we left him and headed to Crescent Bay to see the <b>Grey Whale</b>. Enroute we picked up a good group of Dalls Porpoise SW of  the VG marker.
In Crescent Bay we ended up with 2 greys, the juvenile and what looked like an adult that swam right under us. We had a quick stop at Race to see the sealions just as <b>T31</b> was making his approach to Race from the east. Once we were out of the reserve we could see him circle the rocks as he tagged a number of animals in there.

Early morning had <b>all three pods</b> of Southern Residents heading up the west side of San Juan, passing Low Island around <b>6:45 AM</b>. They continued on up Swanson Channel, through Active Pass and went on up to the Fraser River. Fortunately we found two <b>transients</b> (T12 &amp; T12A) feeding just south of James Island. Tom on Stellar Sea called and let us know they made a kill while he was watching, and it appeared that they did one kill while we were on scene, and another about 30 minutes after we left. We also heard a call on the radio that a dozen Pacific White-sided <b>dolphins</b> were seen in Speiden channel, but were gone by the time we got there.
<br/>John Boyd (JB) 
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
We located a rather large (12+) group of <b>transients</b> today just at the Georgia Strait side of Active Pass. They milled about at the opening of the Pass for awhile, then set off in a mostly Northerly direction. They were travelling with a pattern of 3 breaths, then a longer dive, but definitely not resting as the group would come together on some dives, split apart on others and sometimes porpoise during their breaths. We have yet to ID these whales, but are reasonably sure that they were transients. There were 2 large males, 1 with a very wide dorsal that had 2 big ripples on the trailing edge, and 1 female with a definite large nick at the base of her dorsal. We also saw several juveniles. No vocals were heard.  Photos should be back by tomorrow and will hopefully help with ID's. The group did pass by one seal without attacking it - guess they had already eaten in Active Pass. When we left these whales, they were meandering northbound along Galiano Island, about 2 miles into the Strait of Georgia. 
<br/>
We headed back to Active Pass just in time to catch up to the southern residents. <b>K pod and J pod</b> passed through seperately with K pod aparently taking the more direct route to the coal docks, while J pod headed northeast towards the river.

At first, the <b>whales</b> were moving in tight knit groups along the southern end of Lopez Island. First <b>K-Pod</b> came by, no vocalizations or percussives, just a nice leisurely pace. Then as the boats moved, we saw another group of whales approaching. Turns out it was <b>J-Pod</b>, and they were in a boisterous mood! As they passed Tom on the Stellar Sea, they began to get very active, with lots of tailslaps, spyhops, and a few breaches. Then they came to us, and it was like watching school kids going out for recess--lots of pushing and surfacing on top of each other. Later, the whales did the usual speed run across Cattle Point, and put on one of the loudest vocalization performances I've ever heard!

I had <b>K's and L's</b> on the west side all day, reports that <b>J's</b> were there but I did not see any.
<b>T100's</b> going west from Race Rocks this afternoon, the <b>gray</b> is still in Crescent Bay and a Pelican at Race Rocks.

<b>All 3 pods</b> seemed to be hanging out near False Bay/Eagle Point, no doubt enjoying the run of silvers coming into the area. The whales were content to do a modified West Side Shuffle as they foraged from Eagle Point up to Andrews Bay, only to turn around and head out to Hein Bank, then back towards Cattle Point up to Lime Kiln, then back down towards False Bay. As we were watching the whales this evening, we observed a female orca (sorry no ID as they were a bit too far and the sun was pretty bright, but I'd guess someone from L-Pod) with two younger calves pass the boat, only to turn around and rush through the water. Then the female came up with a fish that the two calves then pushed and shoved to get at!  Gulls rushed in to try and get a sample too.

Lots of <b>Orcas</b> cruising by now <b>10:30 to 11 AM</b>. They are pretty spread out and heading south from the Limekiln Light House on the west side of San Juan Island.

Myself, and several other people fishing in the SW Coho Derby, saw LOTS of <b>orcas</b> at approximately <b>10:00 a.m.</b> (maybe 15-20). From my vantage point in Mutiny Bay, they appeared to be off Olele Pt.(near Mats Mats Bay) In Admiralty Inlet. I saw breaching, tale slaps, etc. from across the inlet. At that time, they were headed N. toward Point Wilson.

We live on Pilot Point (north of Kingston on Kitsap Peninsula &amp; just south of Pt. no Pt.) -- approximately one mile north of the Eglon Boat Ramp.  This morning about <b>8:00 a.m</b>. we sighted a large <b>orca</b> pod (15 or so animals) -- apparently feeding but also appearing to "play" -- i.e. swimming single file in unison, circling back, leaping together, partial breaches, and much blowing etc. There were definitely some males in the group -- with large dorsal fin -- and also what appeared to be juveniles.  The currents in the area (just offshore) are extremely strong during tidal changes and this is where they were feeding. The orcas remained in the area for at least an hour (much to our delight).

 Early morning reports had <b>all 3 pods</b> (except L12's) slowly making their way North. L12's were reported to be at the Romeo Alpha marker (out past Hein Bank) and headed west, and rumors of <b>transients</b> off Victoria were also being reported. So we made the gamble to head South, and we got lucky as we saw <b>J Pod</b> porpoising in a neat line, heading from Smith Island towards Cattle Point.

<b>4:00 PM</b> - The <b>Orcas</b> are near Eagle Point, SW San Juan Island.
<br/>Captain Jim Maya, Maya's Charters

<br/>*<br/>
I drove down the west side of Whidbey Island, &amp; found the <b>orcas</b> at about <b>10:30 am</b>, spread out between Double Bluff on Whidbey &amp; just north of Pt. No Pt. on the Kitsap Peninsula, heading slowly north. At <b>11:20 am</b> they were at Bush Pt, on the Whidbey side, very close to shore, traveling in tight groups, doing a lot of tail-lobbing &amp; active behavior. They kept heading north, &amp; I watched them from Lagoon Pt. until about noon, still on the Whidbey side, still actively foraging, lots of breaching! There were at least 3 or 4 males, &amp; so many whales that I'm quite sure it was all 3 pods, though they were so spread out &amp;/or in such tight groups it was very difficult to count. After they passed Lagoon Pt, they begin to spread out again, between Keystone &amp; Ft. Flagler. I continued following them up the west side of Whidbey Island, from Lagoon Pt. to Ledgewood Beach (<b>12:30 pm</b>) to Ebey's Landing (<b>1 - 1:30 pm</b>), to Partridge Pt (<b>2 pm</b>). As they were passing Ebey's Landing, they formed into 3 or 4 resting lines, but continued in a northwesterly direction. At Partridge Pt. there was a pod close to shore, actively breaching &amp; tail-lobbing, and others further out. By <b>2:45 pm</b> they were in a resting line again, heading toward Lopez Island, just SE of Iceberg Pt. It was difficult to tell for sure which way they were heading, but it looked like they might have been turning north up into Rosario.

Looked like <b>all three pods</b> off Limekiln at <b>8 am</b>. The climax was having L-57 and most likely K-20 having a little tryst just outside the kelp bed. Lunging, head standing, cart-wheels, breaches, tail lobs, chin-ups, logging, surface vocals...you name it they were doing it.  Approximately 10-15 individuals well inside Deadman's Bay.

The Odyssey left Friday Harbor at <b>1 PM</b> and headed out to the Salmon Banks where all <b>pods</b> were reported to be feeding and slowly moving offshore. ...at Cattle Pass ... at 2 miles we could see dorsals and spouts. When we arrived on scene the whales were spread out and foraging as they moved. We saw at least one with a silver salmon in her mouth and heard the hunting clicks as they swam by. I know it's not correct to ascribe human feelings to animals but the whales seemed content. They were well fed and still feeding as they grazed on the incoming fish. 
... near the Salmon Bank buoy... a Minke surfaced dead ahead and 100 yards out. I chopped the engines and we sat and watched as the whale surfaced and slowly moved in a predictable line for the next 15 minutes. While the Orca always seems aware and interacting with the surface world, the Minke seems aloof and unconcerned with us. They are not as interesting to watch from a behavioral standpoint but they grow on you after awhile. They have large alien lives lived very differently than ours. Graceful and slow, their realm seems more below the surface than our local pods.

In response to the Sept. 10 Gray whale sighting off the Vashon ferry:
We did send a boat out to this area and also had a 2nd report. The other report was of 2 humpback whales and on the boat trip by Erin Falcone and Jessie Huggins from Cascadia, they found and IDed a single humpback whale who by then was further south off Redondo. Erin and Jessie are back out today (Sept. 13) checking on a sighting of a whale in Dana Passage that could be the same humpback or a different whale.

<br/>*<br/>... on the west side of San Juan Island. <b>All 3 pods</b> were hanging around for most of the day right of South Beach/Cattle Point area. As we shut down and awaited the whales, we were fortunate enough to witness a very large mixed group of whales pass between us and another boat. As the passed, they began vocalizing so loud it was incredible! Above and below the water was just awash in squeeks and squeels, clicks and blowhole sounds! It seemed like we were in an aviary, not listening to orcas! The whales stayed in a very tight group and pretty much just made a slow move further off shore.

I saw a pod of <b>Orcas</b> frolicking and spouting near the mouth of the Siltcoos River from the Oregon Dunes, just to the south of the Snowy Plover protected area. I kept watching with my binoculars, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Dark creatures, smaller than the whales I'm used to seeing, but with pointy top fins and an occasional show of tail flukes. Lots of sea lions were there too, hanging out in the waves closer to shore, and at first I thought it might be a group of them, but they are so much lighter, and don't have the pointy fins and flukes. It wasn't until I saw the signs posted along the Old Town dock that I was able to give a name to what I had seen.

Tom Averna found <b>T-22 and T-23</b> around Spieden Island. The locals (<b>So. Residents</b>) were coming in as well. By the afternoon, the locals were by False Bay and we got a report that four Transients and a young one were by Yellow Island, northbound. We followed them to Jones Island were they caught up with some kayakers. They hugged the shoreline and then found a seal in front of the North harbor. They took a long time to get the seal. I think they were showing the young one how to fluke bash it. In the end, it was lunch, then they came by the boat, headed back around the island and breached a couple of times. They did one more loop before heading off to Spieden.

And that big boy L-41 (Mega) breached twice. To top the day, L-94 (Calypso) went down one side of the boat, around the back, and up the other side in a very, very slow circle just below the surface.

I'd have to guess it was <b>L-Pod</b>, but they were pretty far off-shore, heading North (west San Juan Island). Dave said he heard other whales were coming down from up North, so maybe they'd meet up in from of the Center. 
Later that Night...I heard a blow, followed by dozens of blows. Whales in close to shore, and by the sound of it, it sounded like all three pods! Lots of tailslaps echoed in the still night.  A couple of huge splashes that could only have been breaches, and one really cool above water vocalization!

This is not a sighting report, but rather a hearing report. As we settled
down for the evening, we heard a large <b>pod</b> going through the southern end of Active Pass around <b>2145</b>. It was dark and the moon had not
yet risen so we could not see them, but the sounds of the orcas exhaling as
they came to the surface was a wonderful nighttime serenade. It is
difficult to say how many whales were in the group or what behaviors they
exhibited (we did hear what sounded like several breaches), but one
observation is notable: one of the whales had a distinct whistle which could
be heard each time he or she exhaled.

Headed out early this morning (<b>9 am</b>) We continued, letting the ebb draw us toward Victoria. The clouds moved North and we saw some spectacular rainbows. Met <b>L and K pod</b> four miles south of Discovery Island in about a one foot chop. As we came back out through Cattle Pass there was a two foot chop and confused seas. The whales had spread out in family groups and were foraging. We watched a couple of groups off the Limekiln light, but moved North to get out of the swell that was tossing us about. Finally left them at Open Bay and headed back through Mosquito Pass.
<br/>It was a great day!

<br/>*<br/>
The <b>L's</b> were out and about, spread out between 2-4 miles between leaders and trailers. This meant that the boats were also very spread out, with some groups of whales by themselves. As the whales meandered from south of Discovery Island towards <b>Salmon Bank</b>, the sun came out, making the whale spotting a bit easier. <b>Towards the end of the day</b>, the waves became much bigger and without our suits, we would have been pretty miserable As the whales neared False Bay, one group of whales (or possibly one whale in that group) spy hopped eleven times!--a few of the L's decided to give us a swim-by and porpoised by the boat.
