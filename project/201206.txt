<b>June 30, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>7:14 pm -</b> Whales at <b>3 tree point (Puget Sound)</b> still southbound 
<br/><b>6:35 pm - 3 orcas just cruised past Alki</b> heading South! 
<br/>Karen Scout  
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4-6 orcas</b> moving from <b>West Point in to Elliot Bay</b>. Being stalked by a 20 foot orange rib with 5-6 people on board towards downtown Seattle. Boat was motoring right alongside a large orca.  
<br/>Mike McGuane  
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:00 PM - Spotted 6-7 whales</b> from North side of <b>Three Tree Point in Burien</b> - blow hole sprays and occasional breach made the evening.  
<br/>Mark Keeney 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:14 pm -</b> Just found the <b>whales between Vashon and West Seattle </b>headed south nearing Lincoln Park and ferry lanes. I am on the West Seattle side and they are spread out a bit though slightly closer to the West Seattle side. 
<br/>Amy Carey 
<br/>*<br/>
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called at <b>5:15 pm</b>, they found the pod of orcas that had been reported off Edmonds - they found <b>8 orcas</b>, no IDs yet, off <b>Elliott Bay</b>, heading toward Alki Pt. 
<br/>*<br/>
Orcas have been loving <b>Eagle Point </b> (San Juan Is.) the past few days, and sometimes linger here for hours. Tonight a handful of them slowly, calmly floated around close to shore within the same 100 yard area, for literally hours. I've attached a photo that isn't "good," but it's kinda cool--  I just took it at sunset this evening from the deck because I loved how the light reflected off the whale, making it seem as though it was either on fire, breathing fire, erupting, or had an urban pin-striping muscle car detail job from the local auto garage!
<br/>Alex Shapiro, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Ten members of J-pod</b> were seen along the eastern side of <b>Saturna Island </b>in Canadian waters today (48°45.2071N, 123°06.9784W). The whales were spread out and traveling north. J2 "Granny", the 101 year old matriarch, was identified among the group. Also L87 "Onyx" was seen traveling with the whales. Onyx is often observed traveling with members of J-pod (L87's mother is L32 (deceased), siblings, L44, L56, L63 (all deceased). Whales were surface active and lobtailing and one whale even breached.
<br/>Amy, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:58 AM -</b> Now hearing calls and clicks on the <b>OrcaSound </b>hydrophones.
<br/>Orca Network  
<br/>*<br/>
Interesting report from the WA Coast this afternoon (could be Northern or Southern residents, or Offshores):
<br/>I received a report from one of our fishery observers this afternoon at <b>2:15pm </b>that there were about <b>50 to 60 killer whales </b>(best guess) about <b>1 mile West of Cape Flattery</b> (he did not give an exact position) and they were traveling Northeast. Sounds like some of them went right by the boat, there were at least 2 very big males but most of the others that were close by were smaller animals. He was not able to get pictures before they were too far away. He also reported at least two humpback whales off of Tatoosh Island, and on our survey last week we <b>also saw humpbacks</b>.
<br/>Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician, Makah Fisheries Management
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:44 pm - Whales nearing Turn Point. 
<br/>1:38 pm - Whales went up the west side today around noon</b>. Last seen heading past Kellett Bluff.
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:22 pm - Killer whales north of County Park</b>. Moving at a very fast clip, northbound!
<br/>San Juan Outfitters
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:43 AM - hearing echolocation at Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/>Monika Wieland
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:19 pm - Clicks and a few calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone</b> (they were reported off Lime Kiln earlier, so must be heading north).
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
Sandra Pollard relayed a very sketchy, 3rd-hand report of possible <b>orcas in Admiralty Inlet around 10:30</b> this morning, between <b>Lagoon Point and Port Townsend</b>, heading north.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:40 pm -</b> Graham Dewitt called from WA State Ferries to relay a report from a ferry captain about <b>4-5 orcas</b> travelling steadily south, just over a mile from the <b>Edmonds ferry dock</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>June 29, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
I came across<b> T002B in Oak Bay</b> on the <b>morning</b>. She went into the Chain Islands and skulked around the seal haulout for a few minutes. No kill was observed. She was last seen heading west.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:10pm - 4-5 orcas</b> headed rapidly east to west past <b>Iceberg Point, Lopez Island</b>.
<br/>Tom Reeve
<br/>*<br/>
We caught up with the <b>whales just west of Eagle Cove</b> (48°27.92N, 123°04.29W) at the southern end of <b>San Juan Island</b>. <b>Eight members of J-pod</b> were spread out and traveling east along the coastline. J26 "Mike", a 21 year old male was traveling with his mother J16 "Slick" who was born in 1972. In general, male killer whales stay with their mothers their entire lives, only briefly leaving her and the pod to mate with females from different pods. Needless to say, these males bring a whole new meaning to the term "Mama's boy." We also saw J14 "Samish" a 38 year old female. Although the whales were primarily traveling they were surface active and did exhibit other behaviors including acrobatics. A calf breached not once, not twice, but FIVE times. Another whale turned over on her back and then slapped the surface with her tail while upside down. 
<br/>Amy, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching and Wildlife Tours 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:30pm at least half a dozen orcas</b> traveling east to west off <b>Iceberg Point</b>, South Lopez Island. A few breaches and tail slaps as they go.
<br/>Tom Reeve
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1245 -</b> Faint <b>calls </b>and loud echolocation clicks on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> -- 
<br/><b>1206 - J pod (S1/4) calls on Orcasound hydrophones</b>. Now echolocation clicks. No detections since 10:00 at Lime Kiln, so likely southbound in Haro Strait.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/> 
I was heading out hiking with my friend Jeff and got a call to head out on the ocean. We left from <b>Sooke </b>(NW of Victoria) and myself and Russ Nicks found a group of <b>transients T36s. T36B and her calf T36B1 as well as T36As and T36</b>. They traveled a steady route with occasional changes in movement where T36Bs traveled closer fanning out for prey and the T36As and T36 hunted offshore. Dives lasted 5 to 6 minutes.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:09 am - </b>My husband just spotted <b>about a dozen Orcas</b> (probable transients) off the nwest side channel of <b>Guemes Island</b>. He said he saw a few babies, one breached the surface and saw one adult catch something and played with it for a few (not sure what "it" was, to far to tell). He was pretty excited to see them and feels pretty blessed when he does get to see them swim by his job site.
<br/>Sara Worley Wright
<br/>*<br/>
About 45 minutes ago, my mother and I saw <b>a whale off alki point</b>. It clearly wasn't an orca. It surfaced three times, and on the last showed a long back, a dorsal fin and it raised its tail. Then it disappeared. The strange thing was its dorsal fin. It was curved on the top, swept back, quite small relative to the back, closeish to the tail, pointed, with a crescent moon shape (like a cut out) down to the back. Now I have seen gray whales before and I don't remember them looking like that. It was big, like a gray, but not massive. It was heading north. Was this a humpback? Can a humpback be in the sound????
<br/>Kate Calamatta
<br/><i>Humpbacks do occasionally travel into Puget Sound</i>.
<br/><br/>
<b>June 28, 2012</b>
<br/><br/> 
Dan Borchardt called to report seeing<b> 3 orcas on the river side of the north jetty of the Columbia River</b>, near Cape Disappointment, at<b> 9:30 am</b>. He said there was one female and two juveniles. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:54 pm - </b>Finally....echolocation on<b> LK Hydrophone</b>-- I thought they were going to elude us for the day!
<br/>Pam Ren
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>three killer whales off of Lime Kiln State Park about 4:00 pm</b> today! It was so exciting for "Midwesterns"--they are so beautiful!
<br/>Carleen David Michael Nicole Whittern
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>4:45pm</b> today <b>a single adult male orca </b>slowly swam east to west past <b>Iceberg Point</b>. Then <b>between 5:45 and 6:30 another 8-12 orcas</b> followed, very slow and spread out. A few tail slaps and breaches, but mainly just slow progress westward.
<br/>Tom Reeve
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:44 PM -</b> We are seeing at least <b>2 Orca whales 150-200 yds off the Norwester building at NASWI</b>. There is a small whale watching boat accompanying them. It looks to only accommodate 12-15 people but it is chock full and they are getting their money's worth! They are heading South to North this time and seem to be riding the incoming tide. A bit of leaping and feeding activity. A fine sight, any time of day.
<br/>Charles Niedzialkowski, <b>Naval Air Station</b>, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Members of <b>J and K pods</b> spread out in <b>Haro Strait</b>, groups of 3 or less, between Salmon Bank and False Bay <b>around 3:00PM</b> (48°27.07N, 123°04.02W). Shachi (J19), Racer (L72), and Onyx (L87) were identified along with rumor of Granny (J2), Mike (J26), and Blackberry (J27). A<b> minke whale </b>was also found in close proximately, just south of Salmon Bank. Overall, 10-15 critters in the area.
<br/>Naturalist Tara, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:30 - </b>John Rogstad of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the captain of the Yakima of at least <b>a dozen orcas</b> abeam of <b>Anacortes </b>frolicking their way southward.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L87 (Onyx)</b> yesterday surfacing with a Salmon in his mouth! We were with the whales in the morning in <b>Rosario Strait</b>, and in the afternoon we were with them around the <b>Eagle Point </b>area. In the afternoon they were spread out and foraging. I'm always so happy to know they have food to eat. This salmon doesn't look very big, but then again in the mouth of a Killer Whale, most things look small! He surfaced several times with it in his mouth before moving on.
<br/>Traci Walter, Western Prince
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:10 pm - J pod and some Ls</b> heading north from <b>False Bay</b> at a good speed.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow

<b>June 27, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
With reports of <b>Resident Orcas on the west side of San Juan Island</b> and <b>Transient Orcas north of Stuart Island</b>, it was a tough call on which direction to take. Fortunately, heading north to search for Transients turned out to be a great choice! At Blundand Island (Gulf Islands, BC) we caught up to about <b>8 or more</b> tightly grouped whales (48°43'86N 123°10'9W), including <b>T102</b>, that seemed to be slowly moving along the island until something kicked a pair into action and they repeatedly porpoised along the island, took a long dive, then surfaced along with the rest of the group. 
<br/>Naturalists Tara, Kristen, and Shelly; San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
I am writing to report sighting of ~<b>7 orcas off the NE shore of Waldron Island</b> last night around <b>7:00</b>. They came from the direction of Sucia and Patos and were travelling south down the channel. They lingered off the shore for quite a long time and then continued on down, only to circle around and head back north but closer to the Orcas Island shoreline.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me if these were residents or transients. I don't know enough to give much more info. There was one big daddy who seemed to stay further ahead while the rest lingered in what appreared to be a whole lot of frolicing.
<br/>Rebecca Moore
<br/>*<br/>
We were with the residents in the middle of <b>Haro Strait</b> south of Kelp Reef when we got a call about a large group of <b>Transients near Turn Point</b>. We hurried over there and found<b> 12-14 animals</b> and they were quite active and doing a lot of socializing with each other. There was one big male<b> T51, the T49's were there and The T36's</b>.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb reports that <b>14 T's</b> were in <b>Boundary Pass</b> all afternoon and early evening, while about 5 more were seen in Navy Pass, between Pender and Saturna Islands.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:23 AM - Orcas at Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/>Robo Lon
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1051 am - Mainly S1 and a few other calls</b> being heard on <b>Orcasound</b>! Happy listening!
<br/>Breanna Walker, Beam Reach Intern
<br/>*<br/>
<b>18:20 - 5nm off Cleland </b>(an island about <b>5 miles NW of Tofino BC</b> on the SW coast of Vancouver Island), <b>a dozen animals</b>, 3 are bulls, open saddles, no chatting travelling very slowly  heading East, images coming in. Shooter says<b> L71 &amp; 78</b> were confidently IDed from yesterdays note.

This <b>transient Pod </b>(I have video of a kill) was about <b>15 strong</b> and discovered <b>between 1800 and 2200</b>. They were heading north through the <b>San Juan Channel</b> from about Friday Harbor until sunset north of Waldron Island. 
<br/>Andrew Nix
<br/>*<br/>
These <b>two gangs</b> came through <b>Campbell River </b>today southbound. They are not animals that i can say i have ever see come through here actually. Without the new guide book and the digital copy on my computer now i wouldn't ave been able to figure them out, hope i got them all right Mostly they were just traveling through the area today. The most action we witnessed was some speed swimming past the entrance to the Campbell itself. Excited to see this gang through...means <b>in 2 days we had 24 different Biggs (Transient) Killers in our area!</b>
<br/>Nick Templeman 
<br/>*<br/>
Dave Ellifrit said <b>J pod and a few L's went slowly north in Haro Strait</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
We then went around the top of San Juan Island and saw our first <b>killer whale just off Henry Island</b>, traveling north west (48 35.480'N 123 12.887'W). There were two of them and they seemed to be propoising out of the water and traveling fast. We then noticed we could see dorsal fins off in every direction. We spotted two large males, one of which was
L-92 "Crewser," and also around was L-41 "Mega" and L-26 "Baba." After watching them for some time, and cruising across the US border into Canadian waters, we took the scenic route back to Friday Harbor, going between Stuart and Johns Island and the eastern side of Spieden.
<br/>Kristen, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:52 pm - Calls on Orcasound.</b>
<br/>Pam Ren

<br/>Hunter Kilpatrick
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:45 - Whales just past eagle point </b>heading north at a fast clip! Two adults porpoising in the lead followed by two adults and a baby!
<br/>Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:27 PM - ORCA AT ORCASOUND.</b>
<br/>Robo Lon
<br/>*<br/>
We left this morning with the report of <b>whales at turn point</b> southbound. By the time we got there the whales had made it almost down to Eagle Point but luckily another group of <b>J's</b> were found along the <b>Pender Island</b> Bluffs! When we first arrived on scene, the whales were VERY active. I was able to ID<b> J2, J8, L87 and the J16's</b>. Breaching, cartwheels, spyhops, even double spyhops!
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
A note about the <b>gray whale in Puget Sound</b> reported by Stephanie Raymond aboard the Clipper III, at 8:20 am heading north just south of West Point, just north of Seattle.
Based on the barnacle patterns on the head, I was able to confirm that <b>the gray whale we saw on 6/26 off West Point was the same one we saw off Point No Point on 6/11</b>.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:21 PM - ORCA AT ORCASOUND</b>
<br/>Robo Lon
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:07 am -</b> Members of <b>J pod foraging at False Bay</b>, slowly heading south.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:45 am - loud S4 calls</b> and echolcation!
<b>8:33  - echolocation on Lime Kiln</b> now
<br/>8:00 - hearing J pod S4 calls
<br/><b>7:52 - loud moaning gruntlike call</b>, sounds like L's, funny
<br/><b>7:19 am - echolocation at Orca Sound</b> Hydrophone
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>gray whale is in Puget Sound</b>. Reported by Stephanie Raymond aboard the Clipper III, at <b>8:20 am </b>a single gray whale was heading north just south of <b>West Point</b>, which is just north of Seattle, possible the same one Stephanie saw on June 11 in Puget Sound.

<br/><br/>
I was out fishing in <b>Nanoose Bay </b>(about 20 miles NW of Nanaimo, BC) with a few buddies last Sunday. The day started off as usual, eating breakfast at home before heading out fishing. While eating I was staring out at the water when I saw the distinct dorsal fins of Killer Whales. I texted my buddy Greg who was already out fishing and let him know the whales were coming his way. Little did either of us know that we would soon get a bit closer to them than we bargained for! We hit the water to go fishing about an hour later and Greg gave me a shout on the radio indicating that the whales were nearby. I wanted to test the new cam so I headed over and pulled up beside him. Further out from us the whales were swimming past and I grabbed a few distant pics. You can find the photos here, at: One scared harbor seal. 
<br/>*<br/>
Just before <b>9am</b> - First sighting for us of the <b>Orcas...off Rosario Head Fidalgo Island</b>...saw at least 6 adults and a calf? 
<br/>Kathy Kaufman
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>9:30 a.m. 3 orcas</b> were spotted in front of <b>Hannah Heights</b>. I went to check it out and saw some amazing behavior. The L's were coming in from the west. Two females were hanging out just south of Edwards Point close in to shore, while a male was about ½ mile south of them, also close in to shore. As the L's got to within about 2 miles of San Juan Island, heading towards Hannah Heights, the male orca started making a beeline for the L's. The two females stayed where they were. As the male got closer, about 15 whales lined up in a greeting line to meet the solo male. They met up &amp; appeared to have a greeting ceremony just with the solo male. The solo male was L87, and the two females were J2 &amp; J8. After this J2 &amp; J8 made their way out to the others, then lead them up island slowly. Loved it!!
<br/>Sharon Grace
<br/>*<br/> 
A great encounter with several L pod whales at Turn Pt. at 3:00 Monday.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:00 -</b> heard that <b>L pod was off of Hannah Heights</b>. We drove to West Side preserve, easy to see them to the south, very spread out and milling and moving in all directions. One female in the lead started heading north at a steady pace. We moved to Lime Kiln to the south side overlook. <b>J &amp; L pod</b> were passing us by <b>11:20am</b> (heard that some of J pod were off Whidbey NAS)  2-5 orca would porpoise in tandem right towards us! Witnessed some tactile behavior, rolls, tail slaps, and some breaches to the north in front of the lighthouse. They streamed by in groups a bit spread out for 20 minutes or more continuing the steady move northward. A stunning and beautiful morning with those majestic beings, such a gift!

Very exciting to hear that <b>Lpod </b>was making their way back into the Salish Sea. By the time our boat caught up with them, Lpod had met up with Jpod and they were all making their way east up <b>Boundary Pass</b>. They were fairly spread out, and in two groups, one at Turn Point on Stuart Island, the other closer to East Point on Saturna Island. We were with the leader group, which included the <b>J2s, the L26s, J19 and J41</b>, and several others. They made their way around East Point into the Strait of Georgia, where they spread out even more and broke into a bout of breaching, spyhopping, and porpoising.

Members of<b> J-Pod</b> were seen off of <b>South Pender Island</b> today. The whales were spread out and moving in an easterly direction. Several individuals were very surface active: spy hopping, lob tailing, rolling over, and even breaching! There were also a number of mature males including <b>J26, "Mike."</b>  After spending some time with J-Pod, Captain Jim heard reports of L-Pod off Turn Point on Stuart Island (48°42.140 N, 123°15.687 W). Again the whales were spread out and traveling in an easterly direction.  Among members of L-Pod, was L41 "Mega" a 35-year-old male!  So, not only did we see whales from one pod today, we ended up seeing two different pods of the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale population!

<b>At 12:30pm</b>, we observed a pod of <b>7 or more Orcas</b> feeding and playing next to <b>Smith Island</b> across from the corner of Ft. Nugent and West Beach Road on Whidbey Island.

<b>8:27am - </b>I started hearing calls on <b>Lime Kiln</b> so we drove down to the southern lookout at the park and watched as all of <b>J pod &amp; L87</b> streamed northward at a steady pace in the beautiful calm of the morning seas. One female breached twice, 100 feet from the rocks. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
Yeeeeeup, with the whole gang. Beautiful stuff. It was really interesting. We found <b>J2 </b>hanging around off Helen Point at the south end of <b>Active Pass (around 3:15pm)</b>, waiting for the rest of J pod to catch up, who were all down the Mayne Island shore further. We waited with her for at least 20 minutes as the rest of the group made their way toward Active Pass, where J2 was waiting. This whole time, Granny was milling around, spyhopping occasionally, and logging at the surface. She also began to tail slap quite a bit, almost like she was getting impatient and signalling everyone else to hurry up (I know, major anthropomorphizing)! She didn't enter the pass until everyone was with her. It was really cool to watch!
Once J pod in its entirety made their way through Active Pass and into the Strait of Georgia, they became really animated and started to breach, porpoise, spyhop, and tail slap. Their tight group formation split into various matrilineal groups, where they continued their way toward Point Roberts.

<br/>*<br/>
We spotted at least fifteen members of<b> J-pod just off the west side of North Pender </b>(48°48.22'N 123°19.93'W) traveling north. The whales were very close, almost on top of each other-true family bonding! We identified members of both the <b>J-22's</b> including "Oreo" (J-22)and her son "Cookie" (J-38), the J-17's including "Princess Angeline" (J-17) and her daughter "Polaris" (J-28), along with some other J's "Samish" (J-14). These whales were especially playful today: breaching, cartwheeling, spy hopping, lob tailing, rolling over, and swimming sideways were just a few of the amazing behaviors we witnessed. The cookie family seemed to be showing a lot more dough than their chocolate chip side today. :)

<b>10am -</b> spotted them from <b>American Camp/Cattle Point </b>overlook heading west from Lopez at a good pace. We spotted <b>L87 around 11:00am at Eagle cove</b> moving steadily northward. The trailers slowed at the north end of South beach, then resumed northward passing Eagle cove about 11:50. We moved up island viewing them from the land bank moving north. We moved to Lime Kiln but they stalled and turned back south and hung out around Hannah Heights. About <b>2pm </b>they headed north again and passed the <b>lighthouse </b>by 2:30 just as a fierce squall hit with sideways rain, high winds and huge swells. A young one breached 7 times in succession! We made our way to the county park and watched them head north to Andrews Bay area, where they stalled and became very active, breaching, tail lobs etc. They then started moving southward again, so did we.  By 6:00pm they were passing Lim Kiln still southerly in groups of 2-4, and they kept coming. I noticed J28 and her babe Star pass, they had not been in the pod earlier so I think they met up north by Andrews Bay (Jeanne said the other group of J's may have been north). We watched what we now believe to be all of <b>J pod and L87 stream by until 8:15</b>. When we left they were still streaming southbound.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
After rounding Cattle Point heading around the west side of the island, we spotted two members of <b>J-pod just outside False Bay</b>. It was an adult female and a smaller whale that looked like a calf. The whales were traveling south but stopped moving and started to dive and surface in one spot. We turned off the boat to watch and see what they were up to. Then, we saw the white underside of the calf's head followed by a squeaky sound. The whale was vocalizing above water! That is something I've never experienced before! The whole boat was silent and focused until the female, who we identified as <b>J-16 or "Slick"</b>, changed direction and surprised us by surfacing near our boat's stern. The smaller calf followed, both sticking around for quite some time. It was amazing!

Having heard reports of whale activity, Captain Craig took us east through <b>Upright Channel</b> and around the north end of <b>Lopez Island</b> where we found <b>6 Transient Orca Whales</b> surfacing and traveling together in Swifts Bay on the northeast side of the island. There were 2 large males and 2 youngsters in the pod.  The whales would surface 3-4 times before diving for several minutes. Transient Killer Whales tend to be stealthier than the fish-eating Resident whales, because they hunt intelligent prey (marine mammals), so they did keep us guessing in which direction to look as they would surface somewhere new after each dive. The whales then began to slowly travel south towards Thatchers Pass.

Time: <b>1400 hours</b>
<br/>Where: [general] Out in the Strait of Georgia from Cape Lazo
<br/>Where: [detail] exactly six nautical miles north [magnetic] from the <b>Comox Bar bell buoy (50-60 miles north of Nanaimo)</b>.
My first sighting was the large black fin of the male orca from some 500 metres. As I closed on the pod I saw female orcas and what I believe were two juvenile males [the fins were smaller than the big male but not curved like the females]. All whales were close to the surface and swimming in a random manner. The two juvenile males periodically would lie together on the surface for some 15 seconds before submerging again. The pod did not seem to be traveling in any set direction. I guess that there were approximately six whales in total but there could have been more.

We then caught up with a male killer whale at 48º 53.31' N, 123º 02.87' W who lob-tailed, exposing the bottom half of his large, fusiform body. Once he surfaced to breath I was able to identify him as <b>"Blackberry" (J27)</b> who is 21 this year. He surfaced a few more times before rolling over, giving us an amazing view of his giant, paddle like pectoral fins. We then started to head back, enjoying the sunshine, flat water, and company all the way to San Juan Island.

We decided to give them a little privacy and let nature takes its course, so we went on to catch up with<b> "Moonlight" (L83) and her son "Midnight" (L110)</b>. The two were cruising pretty fast, porpoising out of the water to keep their speed, allowing us to see the full extent of their black and white bodies. They changed direction on us a few times giving us a little play, both on the starboard side and off the stern.

The Center for Whale Research folks were out taking photo identifications, so they will post the results. We were grateful to witness breaches, spy (sky) hops, tail lobbing, and foraging behaviors. To see the physically close families with many mothers and youngsters closer to shore, while older females and males tended to be out in Haro Strait, gave guests an insight to the culture and life long bonds these whales share. A group of males brought up the rear and began porpoise swimming, 2 together in synchronicity!!

Transient killer whales<b> T30, T30A, T30B and T30B1</b> were off <b>Discovery Island and Trial Island</b> near Victoria BC. Three harbor seals were taken with allot of splashing and circling with visible parts of the killed animal present. We arrived at Discovery Island and Trial Island to major Harbor seal Haul outs. The T30s with their new calf T30B1 were there traveling. Their pattern changed and they went into foraging mode. The Large Male T30A was doing long 7 minute dives while the females stayed above the surface. They soon located a harbor seal and two females using short bursts of speed rammed from different directions. There was a lot of fluke slapping and chasing. The group then separated into two units with T30A and T30 feeding closer to Trial Island while the other group went off shore. Typical inshore and offshore behavior. Remember transients as a top predator should not stay in one area while hunting for too long. They consumed three harbor seals within two hours.

Sarah Paturzo called to report seeing <b>6 orcas around 9:00 am</b>, about 100 yards from shore at the <b>Pigeon Point Light Station</b>, between <b>Santa Cruz and Halfmoon Bay, CA</b> near Pescadero, CA. She said there was one adult male, one subadult male, two females and two juveniles. They were feeding for over an hour. After about an hour the adults were going under for a few minutes at a time while the calves were fluke slapping at the surface.

<b>J-pod</b> was also around the San Juan Islands today, and we caught up with some of the Orcas off <b>Stuart Island</b> (48º 40.025' N, 123º 13.402' W). The whales were spread out and traveling north. We watched as one whale tail slapped in the distance, and another even partially breached in front of our boat! As we saw different whales, we were able to identify <b>"Mike" (J-26)</b> swimming with his mother <b>"Slick" (J-16)</b>.

Minke(?) off Vashon - We had a whale surface right next to our boat while salmon fishing off Neil Point on the<b> South end of Vashon Island</b> on Saturday <b>morning</b>. We spotted him several hours later swimming, and zig zagging with a group of racing sailboats in Colvos Passage near Spring Beach. He did not breach and we could not get a picture of it's tail.

<br/>*<br/>
We find <b>J pod</b> on the westside of<b> San Juan Island</b>, moving north. Today the family is moving along in two groups and we have the chance to spend time with both groups! Although there is a lot of traveling behavior, there must also be some fish around as there are several turn around and lots of tail slapping today. We cut out to go around  the 1/2 mile no boat zone in front of Limekiln lighthouse and the whales put on speed. Both boat and Orcas arrive at Andrews Bay about the same time. The second group has both J-27, Blackberry, and J-34, Doublestuf crusing along together. The massive black fins appear and  then disappear below the surface.

The rain and fog didn't seem to bother <b>J-Podders</b>! Of course they've adapted to their wet ocean world. Over the years I have seen more surface active behaviors off of <b>Henry Island</b>, compared to other areas, so I was very thankful we were able to see <b>J-2</b>, 101 year old matriarch, Granny in the lead of spread out groups. The sprinkles had stopped, the sun broke through the clouds, a whale breached and another's tail fluke slapped the water! Then did Granny vocalize "come here!"? as Balcomb's Orcas porpoised and sped swam toward Granny's groups and Stuart Island.

Cascadia Research conducted surveys with two RHIBs (rigid hull inflatable boats) off the northern Washington coast (15 June 2012) in excellent weather and covering close to 200 nmi. Personnel included Greg Schorr, Erin Falcone, John Calambokidis, and Kiirsten Flynn. Sightings for the two boats included:
<b>12-14 Southern Resident Killer Whales about 20 nmi offshore of La Push</b>, identifications still pending (will be sent to CWR for confirmation) but included <b>members of L Pod</b> including <b>L77 and her calf</b>
<br/>• <b>4 transient killer whales</b>

We found the <b>Southern Resident Orca Whales off Pile Point</b>, on the west side of San Juan Island. It was <b>J pod</b> - or at least some of J pod. It was about <b>6:15 pm</b>. The whales would come up for about 3 seconds with a huge exhale and dove right back down again. We gently followed their path south to False Bay. They continued the same behavior of a short exhale/inhale and down for the next 20 minutes or so. We left the orcas there near False Bay just after 7:00 PM. While motoring back to Friday Harbor the Captain spotted a few Harbor Porpoise. They too were quick in coming up and going back down. Lighting was nice. Water smooth like silk. Temperature mild. Ah......summer - at last.

We had an amazing encounter with this large <b>gang of Transients</b>. We picked them up in the am on our first tour Southbound through <b>Seymour Narrows</b> with the flood tide.

<b>6:30-7:30 p.m. -</b> We first saw the <b>pod of Orcas in Useless Bay</b> traveling south. There was a NOAA research boat closely following them. We believe the pod had around 12 family members including at least two males. Most of them were swimming close together. They went under and surfaced approximately every three minutes. They turned around north of Edmonds and swam back in the direction of <b>Point No Point</b>. At one point, Orcas were swimming both north and south. The pod swam close enough to shore that when they surfaced, we could hear that burst of air come out of their blowholes. The NOAA vessel was with them the entire time. We would've loved to have been on that boat with them. A few times, it looked like the whales surfaced close enough that one of the researchers could've reached out and touched them. It was still a THRILL to observe these spectacular mammals from the beach!

Today we spotted <b>CA50 and CA50b about 2 miles outside Moss Landing (CA) harbor at around 10:30am.</b> The pair was very stealthy &amp; staying under for 10 minutes at a time. They moved in to just one mile from shore and then turned west. At some point (we did not see) they made a kill... we could see bits and pieces floating to the surface and birds began to gather. We then left the killer whales and headed out 3 miles from shore where we encountered <b>2 humpback whales</b>. The killer whales traveled through and passed within 100 yards of the humpbacks.

Initially the whales were spread out across the channel traveling south, although upon our arrival a calf did greet us with two breaches! As the whales traveled through the channel a few individuals lob-tailed while others were suspected of foraging as they changed directions quickly and frequently. By the time we left the whales, 5 individuals had come together and were surfacing in close proximity with each other as they continued traveling south. We even saw "Tucker", a black lab, working with his team of researchers searching for whale scat.

I wonder if the whales have territorial agreements? We don't often sight the different ecotypes of Orcas-Killer Whales in the same area, at the same time. Since Balcomb's Orcas were out of our range, I wasn't surprised to hear <b>Bigg's Transient Killer Whales</b> were by the<b> D'Arcy Islands</b> at Vancouver Island, Canada. We went for the international tour! T-020, a 49 year old male was with his 44 year old sister, <b>T-021</b>. They were quiet and traveling slowly, appearing to be resting at times, with the 2.5' flooding tide. These whales have managed to share their entire long lives, at times surfacing together, shoulder to shoulder, a beautiful sight!

We caught up with <b>T20 "Kwatsi" and T21 "Pandora" </b>1.5nm south of<b> Kelp Reef</b> (Haro Strait). We followed them as they made their way northward up to <b>D'Arcy island</b>. The pair took deep dives, and during most of the encounter were 200-300 yards apart. Just before approaching D'Arcy, they came together and scoped out harbour seals at the southern tip of Little D'Arcy. No kill was witnessed, but the two did disappear for nearly 10 minutes at one point, and the seagulls started to gather at that time, so one would think they were ripping something apart down there ....

We heard a few rumors of Big Black Fish milling around Lime Kiln so we headed in that direction. As we passed <b>South Beach</b> we saw our first group of dorsal fins break the water surface (<b>Haro Strait</b>, 48°26.27N 123°01.48W). Big <b>"Mike" (J26)</b> somehow made his way into a group of female K's including <b>"Raggedy" (K40)</b> and seemed to be looking for a hot date! He was definitely showing off what he's got, wrestling around, and strutting his stuff. We figured we'd let him continue his pursuit and head west into open water to catch up with Cappuccino (K21). We rode alongside <b>Cappuccino (K21)</b> for a bit. He was just chillaxin' by his lonesome, milling around, doing his own thing. His pace was great for us though! We were able to cut the motor, watch him slowly emerge from the water, releasing large, exuding blows, and glide back slowly into the water. His actions were so smooth it caused passengers to grow silent, awestruck by the size and serenity of this amazing creature, living and breathing beside them. 
There were also a number of other groups <b>both from J-pod and K-pod</b> spread out in the surrounding area fishing and what not. The Kittiwake got to ride with both Blackberry (J27) and Polaris (J28). We ended up leaving the whales still milling around in the same area at approximately <b>3:30 PM</b>. All in all, it was another unbelievable day amongst our Southern Residents!

We arrived on scene at <b>1225 </b>near Otter Bay in northern Swanson Channel (48 47.537N  123 20.062W) to find <b>L pod spread out all the way across the channel</b> heading south fast. The whales were too spread out to find everyone there that day but we did see L77 and her new calf L119. Erin H. got a belly shot on L119 and it looks to be a female. We believe eight Ls (the L2s, the L54s, and L84) were not present and were off somewhere else. We followed the Ls as they continued south in Haro Strait in singles and small loose groups and left the whales in Mitchell Bay in front of Snug Harbor at 1448 (48 34.524N  123 11. 534W).
<br/>Whales Photographed: <b>L22, L25, L26, L27, L41, L47, L53, L72, L77, L79, L82, L83, L85, L86, L89, L91, L92, L94, L95, L103, L106, L109, L113, L115, L116, L118, and L119</b>
<br/>*<br/>
These are the whales I ID'd. <b>L77, L119, L25, L85, L41, L94, L113, L22, L79, L89, L27, L55, L82, L116, L103, L109, L118, L86, L106, L26, L90, L92, L53, L95, L105, L47, L91, L115 and L87</b>. There were others present as well. <b>All J pod whales but not J30</b>. This was between the hours of <b>4:30 and 8:00pm from shore at Land Bank and Lime Kiln Pt. State Park</b>. More of the day on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

<b>Mid-day, L-Pod</b> residents headed south, down<b> Haro Strait</b> with an ebbing tide, spread out in many groups. Off of Stuart and Henry Island, we were thrilled to see <b>L-77 Matia</b> with her new baby girl;<b> L-119</b>! And<b> L-41 Mega</b> looks regal; he is the eldest male in the Balcomb's Orcas, at 35 years old. The whales began to gather closer together and porpoise (fast, lunge) swim! We heard on the radio that J-Podders were off of Lime Kiln State Park, heading north! They turned south though; L-Podders joined them and a community gathering of<b> L and J Pod</b>families going back and forth in <b>Haro Strait </b>along San Juan Island, continued for hours! Out at Whale Watch Park, I watched them forage and socialize well into this special day and evening!

We had the best show of our lives out at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. We watched different groups from <b>J and L pod</b> for a total of 4 hours, <b>from 4-8</b>, coming in VERY close to shore (we were probably 20-30 feet from the whales that came by the lighthouse) and doing lots of surface activity - I saw a total of 14 breaches throughout the day, and countless tail lobs, pec slaps, spyhops....oh my! It was a party! Never felt luckier!

The first sighting at <b>Lime Kiln Point State Park</b> was of the southbound<b> J-Pod between 12 and 12:30</b>. Around 2:15, five J-Pod whales headed back north, followed by the rest of J-Pod about half an hour later, all of them pretty close to shore. <b>They met up with Ls north of the lighthouse</b>, and all the whales headed <b>south in Haro Strait at 3:00</b>. Once again, they didn't go far, and were <b>milling close to shore off of Land Bank for the next two hours</b>. It was amazing to watch, with the whales swimming in tight, slow-moving groups amid the choppy water as the wind had picked up. There seemed to be lots of touching and rolling around with each other. Finally, by <b>6 PM, all the whales headed north</b> once again.
You can see some photos I took from today's amazing encounter here.

We got early reports of<b> J pod at battleship</b> going south but then <b>L pod popped up in Active Pass</b>! They were heading south around 9 knots....very hard to keep up with but awesome to see. I wasn't able to take any photos, I was just trying to keep up with them.

Today we caught up with 3<b> members of L-pod</b>, a female and her offspring, on the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> (Haro Strait 48°33'56.84N, 123°10'50.29W). They were headed south right against the shore line, moving at a very quick rate. Within a few minutes of arriving we discovered that the female was <b>L-55 </b>also known as "Nugget" and one of the calves was <b>L-118</b>! We were very excited to see L-118 return home with mama because this calf was just born last year (2011) and can now be given a proper name. It is days like these that really allow us to appreciate our Southern Resident Killer Whales, because although endangered, and battling many threats to their food and environment, mama still returns home with her calves showing us the true strength of the species. We left the group at approximately <b>3:03 PM </b>still making their way south, to catch up with the rest of the pod.

<br/><br/>
Marie Waterman of Washington State Ferries Operations, relayed a report from the crew of the Hyak, of <b>3 to 5 whales heading south, 3/4 of a mile off Thatcher Pass</b> (west side of Rosario Strait, opposite Anacortes) at <b>8:50 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
I started out on the Western Explorer and found part of <b>J Pod off Pile Point and False Bay area</b>. Some were actively foraging, some were socializing. On our way back we were looking at seals at Whale Rocks, and in the distance the <b>other group of J's were rounding around Lopez </b>heading up island to where the other whales were. They grabbed our attention far away because of all the breaching, tail lobs, and cartwheels that they were doing! We went back to take a quick peek at this group and they started to porpoise quickly! Saw <b>Granny (J2)</b> in that group as well. After the trip, I headed out to the west side only to have whales again! (oh darn!) This time when I saw them they were very tucked into shore. I got to watch them swim underwater and play with kelp right under me.
<br/>Traci Walter
<br/>*<br/> 
Meanwhile, L pod was heading south: 
<br/>I did manage to get out on the skiff to see <b>L-Pod - some K's too, I believe</b>, but haven't had time to confirm from photos. They were incredibly spread out from just above the Little River ferry terminal by<b> Comox to Texada</b> (northern Georgia Strait) and could see breaching down by Denman and Hornby Islands! Also thought there was some splashing almost by Harwood Island. A huge spread! It was like glass and sunny out there so very easy to spot. They would slow down for very short periods of time then pick up the pace again doing about 6 - 7 knots. Guess they got the scent of home territory! Great vocals though, even with the boat noises. <b>The last few passed the North tip of Texada Island about 5 pm</b>. Curious as to what time they made it "home".
<br/>Susan MacKay
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>4 Orcas feeding in (north) Georgia Strait</b> on Friday. There were two larger whales quite a ways ahead of two smaller Orcas. They were assumably feeding as they were up and out of the water and then down for 10-20 seconds and sometimes longer, but always surfacing and diving back down. We saw them at <b>2:35 PM</b> at about <b>Bates Beach</b> area, off the east coast of Vancouver Island, just north of Comox, south of Merville. The larger two were quite a way ahead and last I saw them was just north of the Powell River Ferry Dock on Vancouver Island. The smaller two were about a half mile north of the larger whales. They were all heading <b>south toward Texada Island</b>.

Great to see the <b>J pod</b> crew passing <b>Eagle Cove</b> just after<b> 9am</b>. They had a little one in tow, and rounded the point on their way up the Haro Strait passing close to shore near the kelp beds. A beautiful sight with which to begin the day!

<b>L pod and K40 were in Johnstone Strait</b> late this <b>afternoon and evening</b>. They were all business, which seems to be the way they are every time I see them in this neighbourhood. I left them eastbound off <b>Naka Creek at 19:00</b> with the end of a big flood behind them. It looked like about 35 whales in total. I haven't gone through the shots in great detail yet but did notice that L119 is still doing well next to L77.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>L-Pod + for a total of 35 Southern Resident Orca</b> are on their way down Johnstone Strait <b>below Robson Bight at 1600 hrs</b>. We're keeping our eyes out for their arrival! I'll let you know if they make it this far or just zip past.

<b>Granny J-2 </b>was in the lead as members of<b> J Pod </b>began to pass by <b>Lime Kiln Pt. State Park at about 5:15pm</b>.

June 5 &amp; 6 - <b>Transient Orcas seen in Tofino area</b> yesterday and today! 
<br/>Keith Roderick Phillips 
<br/>*<br/>
I was trolling off <b>House Rock (NW of Brookings OR)</b>, about 42.04, in 48 fathoms. I saw the splashing SW of me, then they (<b>orcas</b>) moved to within 1/8 mile of me. They were feeding, including tail slapping, and I saw the<b> one male</b> breach once. There were either <b>two or three females or juveniles</b> with him.  
<br/>Gary Smith
<br/>*<br/>
Just north of <b>Active Pass</b> we spotted <b>a killer whale breach</b> in the distance! (48° 53.267 N 123° 17.661 W). It was<b> J-Pod</b>. The whales were spread out, traveling in small groups of three to four. We watched them for as long as we could before having to make the long trek back.

Out on <b>Salmon Bank</b> in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, we luckily sighted <b>2 Minke Whales</b> zig-zagging about, foraging, being the unpredictable slinky Minkes they are! I try to imagine I am the bait fish they are after, where would I go?

We were our on the water last Tuesday (near <b>Craig, SE Alaska</b>) and saw <b>a small pod of 6 orca</b> at appoximately noon at the junction of Ulloa Channel &amp; Meares Passage Lat/Lon: 55 16.726 N, 133 11.703 W, heading south right tight against the shoreline. Did not see any large (male) dorsals. There were 2 calves in the pod. Both small and one was as tiny as I have ever seen! I was not able to get very good pictures as they were close to shore.  Dark whales against a dark shoreline on a very gray morning. But I attached what I was able to enlarge in hope you can identify them. Whales transit this area frequently.

Andy Stevens was sailing off <b>Brown's Point, west of Tacoma, about 5 pm</b>, when he saw <b>a gray whale</b>. He stayed with it for two hours. It was swimming well. He said it was much bigger than his 22' boat.
<br/>*<br/>
As we reached <b>Salmon Bank</b>, it took only a few minutes to spot <b>a minke whale</b> in the distance. As we slowed, we noticed that there was <b>more than one minke</b> around. Two surfaced at the same time, giving us an amazing look of their blow holes and bodies. But the minke whales weren't alone. There were harbor seals all around! They would poke their heads out of the water then dive back down. Also in the area were lots of harbor porpoise! We saw their small fins break the water surface in every direction off the boat. Sea birds were around too; gulls, cormorants, rhinoceros auklets, common murres, and even a pacific loon! Truly a spectacular day!

<br/>*<br/>
June 3 &amp; 4 - It's been awfully quiet out on the water for the past few days, but we did find <b>multiple minkes at Salmon Bank</b> on <b>both June 3 and 4</b>. There were at least two of them present both days, and they were surfacing frequently, skimming the surface with their mouths open but not lunge-feeding. Must have been plenty of food to be had out there, because there were a lot of Dall's and harbor porpoises and harbor seals around where the whales were.

Center for Whale Research Encounter # 25 * <b>T30's east of Baynes Channel</b> (photos and map)
<br/>Observers: Dave Ellifrit
<br/>After receiving reports of the <b>T30's</b> and viewing them in Cordova Bay through the scope at CWR, I departed Snug Harbor in Orca at 1635 for a brief encounter.  I arrived on scene at <b>1705 </b>about a mile NE of <b>Baynes Channel</b> (48 27.87N 123 14. 07W) where the whales were milling and gulls were diving to pick up scraps so they had obviously just made a kill. One could even smell the greasy slick from the blubber of the seal or porpoise they had just eaten. I left the whales in the same spot at <b>1715 </b>as they started moving SW toward Baynes Channel and arrived back at Snug Harbor at <b>1740</b>.
Whales Photographed: <b>T30, T30A, T30B, T30B1, and T30C</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Today we visited <b>five Orca Whales on the western side of D'Arcy Island </b>(mid-Haro Strait - 48°04.14N, 123°18.21W). As we approached the scene we could immediately tell they were Transients based on their stealthy behavior. Once they went under no one knew when, or where, they would come up next. After continually changing paths they unexpectedly surfaced right towards our boat providing us with a great amount of excitement and the most amazing view! There was <b>one LARGE male</b>, his dorsal fin standing almost 6 feet tall, along with <b>two small calves, and two females</b>. At first, it appeared they were feeding judging by the swarm of gulls hovering over their tracks, waiting to dive bomb any left overs, but after a while, it seemed as though they went back on the hunt as they chose one direction and stuck to it. They eventually gained speed and headed south, surfacing multiple times for shorter dives.

<br/>*<br/>
Dean Troette, Eureka Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, called to report seeing <b>two orcas near Crescent City CA</b>, a female and calf, about 50 yards off the end of the north jetty, heading north, at<b> 12:30 pm</b>.

2nd hand report this morning...<b>Whales near Anacortes</b> right now! Most likely <b>L pod</b>, this is the group with the brand new baby:) At <b>8:10</b> they passed Strawberry Island along the west shore of Cypress. They are moving fast with an ebb tide, heading south toward Washington Park.
<br/>Jill Hein
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>T30s </b>were stalking around <b>D'Arcy Island</b> (mid-Haro Strait) today at around <b>1:15pm</b>. When we encountered them, they were traveling very slowly, surfacing as a group. There is a young calf in the group, who appears to be the offspring of <b>T30B</b>. They were displaying a pretty classic transient zig-zag pattern of surfacing, but doing so very slowly. They were making their way south for the most part.
<br/>Tasli Shaw
<br/>*<br/>
We encountered transient orcas, <b>T30, T30A, T30B, T30B1 and T30C</b>, while on Maya's Westside Charters this afternoon as they traveled south on the west side of <b>D'Arcy Island</b>, BC. We left the scene at about <b>3:30</b> as the whales continued south passing to the west of Zero Rock.
