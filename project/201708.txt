This <b>pod of orcas</b> was spotted Thursday August 31 at about <b>8:15 AM headed South about 1/4 mile south of Brace Point, West Seattle</b>. -Video by Richard Lunt, August 31, 2017
<br/>(<i>Included in our previous Whale Report as <b>T65As, T124A1 &amp; T124D</b> - ALB</i>)

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - South Puget Sound - Beautiful <b>15 year-old T137A...past Steilacom and to Nisqually Reach</b>. They headed west passing Anderson Island. They were frantically active. Lots of breaching. Head stands. Tail slaps. Tail waves. Porpoising all over the place! Then they would go silent and take long dives.  Such a gift to see them." -Photo by Kim Merriman, August 31, 2017 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

August 31 - Saratoga Passage - Yes! Definitely the <b>T100s</b>. We found them again (after cruising Deception Pass) an hour later in the exact same spot but heading south in a resting line. (<b>just north of Onamac</b>, Camano Island). -Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:32 p.m. - In Saratoga Passage</b>, 1 nautical mile west of Rocky Point. <b>Four Orcas milling about. One big male, two females and a juvenile.</b> Seagulls were enjoying salmon scraps floating in the water... (probably seal scraps). -Gail Greenwald

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:23 p.m. -</b> Chilkat Express is on scene (with T100s) just north of Onamac Point north bound closer to the Camano side but in line with the entrance of Penn Cove.
Justine Buckmaster

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:55 p.m. - </b> straight <b>across from Onamac on Camano</b>, but on whidbey side! Could see large male and female with little one! -Desi Tracy

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:05 p.m. - </b>Whales heading north fast <b>towards Hidden Beach.</b> Probably more on Whidbey side. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:00 p.m. - Pod has exited Holmes Harbor</b>, and just <b>passed beautiful Baby Island</b> (which is teeming with seals and birds) and are continuing northbound up Saratoga. Female and calf in lead, male and juvie trailing short distance behind. Beautiful!
<br/><b>2:35 p.m. -</b> pod definitely hunting on <b>north side of Beverly Beach</b>. A lot of surface activity in little bay between Beverly Beach and Saratoga Beach Community. Awesome! They are now steady northbound. 
<br/><b>2:00 p.m. -</b>  we watched them move south out from Dines point where they then flipped, stalled and look to be on the hunt. We are moving back to east side of the harbor in hope to relocate them on that side. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:27 p.m. - </b>These appear to be the<b> T100s. Southbound still Dines Point</b>. -Trevor Tillman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:20 p.m. -</b> Saratoga pod booked it and has gone <b>into Holmes Harbor</b>. Steady southbound mid channel south of Greenbank north of Dines point. Bigg's/Transients - <b>T100s</b> actively pursuing someone in <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, Whidbey Island.
<br/><b>12:48 p.m. -</b>  the pod has flipped now angling NW directionally<b> toward Baby Island/Holmes Harbor</b>. 
<br/><b>12:25 p.m. -</b> The pod of 4? Including adult male grouped, steady <b>southbound more Camano side just south of Cama Beach</b> now. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:50 a.m. - Orcas in Saratoga Passage!</b> Marilyn Armbruster spotted orcas in Saratoga still <b>north Cama Beach State Park </b>but south of Onamac Point, Camano Island...they are mid channel. We are watching from Baby Island Heights area they appear to be heading South, maybe angling towards Camano Island side. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

August 31 - Juan de Fuca - <b>T109A</b> - WOW! 5 minutes from our docks (<b>Sooke</b>) we were the first to find Transient / Biggs Killer Whales the T109a's (I think) Hunting and feasting on seals. Than we visited <b>3 Humpback whales</b> that were minutes away, than <b>a Gray Whale</b> and numerous Sea Lions and our local Sea Otter...-Photo by Paul Pudwell, August 31, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

August 31 - Commencement Bay to Case Inlet - <b>T137s in Case Inlet this evening</b>, just south of Herron Island around 7:30 pm<b></b>, heading north toward Stretch Island at a steady pace. I counted<b> at least 6</b>. Dive times of 2-3 minutes with shorter surface intervals. Fair number of harbor seals and harbor porpoise in the area, just sort of watching them pass by; didn't totally clear out like they usually do when Orcas are present. -Dave Berliner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:50 p.m. -</b> There's<b> a pod of orcas going through Draytons Passage towards Vaughn</b>, Wa just now! -Amanda Olmos

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:30 p.m. - </b>The South Sound orcas headed <b>south past Steilacom and to Nisqually Reach</b>. They headed west passing Anderson Island. They were VERY active at times. And then they would dive for long down times. Very little boat traffic and very calm waters. There was a fire boat on the water as well. It was stopped, as were we. All of a sudden we could see the whales travel across in front of the fire boat and then they started to vocalize - under and above water. At one point, one of the whale actually nudged in between the hull of the catamaran fire vessel and CONTINUED TO VOCALIZE! It sounded like an above water hydrophone. Fabulous. When we last saw them they were <b>traveling west into Case Inlet</b>. They were frantically active. Lots of breaching. Head stands. Tail slaps. Tail waves. Porpoising all over the place! Then they would go silent and take long dives. Such a gift to see them. <b>T137 and T137D. T137A, T137B, and what looks to be T37A1.</b> -Kim Merriman
<br/>(<i>IDs by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:39 p.m. - 3 orcas heading south by Steilacoom</b> right now! -Lisa Wiksten

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:18 p.m. - At least 2 Orcas heading south past Fox Island</b>. -Anita French

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:00 p.m. - </b>Report that <b>roughly 6 are southbound in the Narrows approaching the bridge</b>.
<br/><b>1:00  p.m. -  </b>Tacoma PD patrol boat reports o<b>rcas northbound toward Point Defiance from Owens Beach</b>. 3 or 4 with a calf. -Durand Dace

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:27 p.m. - Orcas (at least 4) off Ruston Way, Tacoma</b> just north of CI Shenanigan's. This pod appeared while I was running on the path. About 20 minutes earlier I had seen <b>at least 3 dolphins traveling north at Point Ruston</b> but didn't get any photos. The <b>dolphins passed by very quickly</b> so I didn't see their faces, just the dorsal fins. I got a 2 minute video of the orcas which I will email you separately, as it would take a long time to upload here. -Leah Collister

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Orca in Commencement Bay, downtown Tacoma. Closer to about <b>12:00</b> as it took me a bit to get back to my boat farther down the dock. Trying to put this in the time line. Spoted <b>a large male Orca broaching about 100 feet south of Marina at Browns Point</b>, just off the old floats breakwater where hundreds of harbor seals hang out. Seals went nuts and headed for the inner marina area. Saw several other Orcas out in the bay. -Norval Cunningham

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I saw them off the <b>ferry dock (south Vashon) this morning</b>. There were <b>at least 4 orcas</b>, a rather small one with them. I took a bunch of photos, but won't be able to post them until Sunday evening. -Sandra Newby

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

August 31 - <b>7:30 p.m. - 2 or 3 orcas traveling west about 100 yards off the south coast of Kingston</b>. Traveled east past Jefferson Beach, then stayed in one area for a while. Various boats, including the Victoria Skipper, stopped to watch. -Gary Mager

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:30 p.m. - At least 6, maybe even 8, just off Point Jefferson, Kingston</b>. Looks like they came from the Port Madison area and as they went by here they headed to the middle of channel. Looked like they were going to be northbound then they turned and milled around for a bit. May have been feeding. -Chris Beamer Otterson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:11 p.m. - Spotted 6 Orcas headed north thru Agate Pass</b>. -Michelle Randall

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Yes! We saw them traveling from <b>Manzanita along Sandy Hook</b>. They stayed for a bit in front of the casino and recently<b> went through Agate Passage</b>. It was incredible. We first saw them at a distance just south of Keyport <b>at roughly 6:00 p.m</b>. They traveled north along Sandy Hook and probably went under the<b> Agate Pass Bridge around 6:45 p.m</b>. Times are approximate, as we were so enthralled and in the moment that we weren't paying attention to anything but them. -Joni Derifield

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:40 p.m. - </b>Abby Love reports watching <b>a pod of orcas in Rich Passage after having watched them pass Manchester Park</b>. They are heading westbound through the passage. She  counted at least 7 and one was noticeably smaller then the others. Too far for ID's. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:40 p.m. </b>- They've' moved north towards Manchester on the Peninsula side. Just received a note from my parents who are on a state park buoy at <b>Blake Island. At about 4:15 they watched a group of 5-6 orcas eating a seal</b>. The group was mid-channel on the west side of Blake Island. They've since moved a bit north towards Manzanita, however they are still in the area and quite active. -Collin Long

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1300 - 7 or 8 orcas northbound at north end Colvos passage</b> at 1300 on 8.31.17. We are just <b>1 mile south of the north end Vashon on the Kitsap</b> side near Southworth/Fauntleroy ferry dock.  The shots from my Iphone aren't as crisp as I had hoped, but we did observe one juvenile and at least one large male with several adult females. My dog Moby was so excited he announced their arrival to us then started swimming out to great them. <b>T65As plus (ID'd earlier) exiting Colvos Passage.</b> Northeast end of Vashon. -Cheers, Tim Ferris

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw <b>6 or 7 orca near shore Fragaria. Hunting then eating harbor seals, at least 2, </b>in water around their lounging rock. Just before high tide. One harbor porpoise, acting injured or exhausted, came close to shore in front of house nearly beaching itself in shallow water. Possibly chased by orca and escaped? I have more photos but can only attach one to this report. All are pixelated due to iPad optics at distance of approx 200 yards. 47.4617 N, 122.5314 W. -Kyle Kennedy

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:19 a.m. - Orcas off Three Tree Point (</b>south side) saw a couple large dorsal before they hid in the fog, now can hear them but can't tell direction of travel or just milling...cmon fog go away!! -Kim Rouse Baumgartner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

My husband just texted @ <b>7:22am that there are orcas on the Seattle/Vashon Passenger only boat run</b>. The captain came over the loud speaker and stopped moving for 5 minutes. -Kelly Burns Keenan

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw <b>a lone orca, maybe more, around Alki 0630 from the MV Kaleetan on the way to Bremerton</b>. It's foggy out so I thought I'd say something. -Regards WSF employee, Jeremy James

A beautiful morning on the water headed towards a report of whales, when we find another group, the <b>T65As</b>! These guys grabbed a seal at <b>Smith Island</b> and then rocketed to go hang out with another group of<b> Bigg's Killer whales, the T137s</b>. Then yet another group in the distance joined up! Socializing and playing ensued! Breaching, tail lobs. What an awesome time on the water! -Western Prince WW (Video below by Traci Walter)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

What an amazing day we had with Transient/Bigg's orcas, <b>T137s and T65As</b>!! We caught up with them on the<b> west side of Whidbey Island</b>, after stopping at<b> Smith and Minor Islands</b> to see wonderful tufted puffins, which is always a treat. The whales were in full active mode, leaping out of the water, sideways breaching, massive tail slaps and cartwheels, and alternating between fast porpoising and slow resting mode. They were obviously on the hunt, though we didn't actually see the prey. One Steller Sea Lion on a buoy was probably relieved that they passed him by! We followed them south almost to Ft. Casey, and then turned north to see harbor seals on the spit between Smith and Minor Islands, and then headed home. A truly fantastic day with these beautiful whales! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

With no sign of the long, hot summer abating, Mystic Sea enjoyed pristine weather conditions from the moment we left the marina and headed <b>towards Port Angeles where we encountered the T60 transient orca family </b>hunting down a seal, the sound of their powerful exhalations carrying across the glassy calm waters.

<br/>(<i>California killer whales visit BC Saturday! Eagle Wing Whale Watching Tours encountered a trio of "exotic" outer coastal Bigg's transient killer whales on 26 August - including three of our California killer whales: male CA20 and females CA54 and CA177, with inner coastal Bigg's transients T60s. They were in the Juan de Fuca Strait, several miles off Jordan River, Vancouver Island. Sooke Coastal Explorations first encountered them, and then Eagle Wing came on scene - including Captain Chris Bane and Naturalist Val Shore. They were likely feeding when Eagle Wing arrived, but the trio soon split off and quickly headed west toward Cape Flattery. Eagle Wing followed them for about 20 minutes before turning back to the T60s, who had headed east. This trio has been seen previously off BC. What an exciting update for our California Killer Whale Project: we have studied these whales for 30 years! -- Alisa Schulman- Janiger</i>)

Stunning &amp; profound two-day Solar Eclipse Totality adventure which included time with this whale. In talking with a couple on the beach we learned the whale had been around since at least 3:30 as they had watched the whale for an hour before we arrived further south. As we spread the word, a nice group gathered to watch the whale. People from babies to elders, from many countries around the world, watched in awe. Smiles abound.

Minke whales - August 22 - <b>08:30 PM -</b> Saw <b>a minke whale out at the Mukilteo ferry dock </b>between Whidbey Island and Hat Island. There was one minke whale seen. The Minke whale just appeared to be traveling at a slow pace and did not to be traveling with any rush out to Hat Island. I did not get the best look at the whale but I did see the dorsal fin for a quick sec and it seemed that the dorsal fin was very small and looked like a Minke whale but I can't be certain. -Austin King

Once again we were lucky to leave the dock on another bright, sunny morning in search of wildlife. Today we traversed more open water and slightly confused seas towards the Olympic Peninsula, where the<b> T30 transient orca family</b> were heading. With a young calf swimming in Mom's slipstream (the area of least resistance) we watched as the whales made <b>steady progress towards Dungeness Spit</b>. Our return journey was via Smith and Minor Island Aquatic Reserve, where we lucked out with sightings of a colorful Puffin (now listed as endangered in Washington State), and Golden and Bald Eagles keeping vigil for tasty morsels among the resting Pacific Harbor seals. Variety is, indeed, the spice of life. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photos Richard Snowberger, Crew, using 300 mm + lens).

On August 19, 2017 I was with another paddle boarder and a friend mine who was in a kayak. We were approximately 500 meters off my property on the <b>North East side of Gabriola Island </b>(we face the Sunshine Coast &amp; we have a property on Queequeg Turnabout). Approximately 200 meters further out, we saw multiple dorsal fins rising out of the water - we new they were <b>Orcas</b>. I fell in the water off my paddle board - we're not sure if this is what precipitated the next set of events, but the whales progressively got closer to us. The other paddle boarder and I made our way back to my property. The kayaker made his way back at a more leisurely pace. However, it was clear that the whales were now following him &amp; he made his way back to a section off the shore (about 20 meters) that was too shallow for the whales to get into to. The whales then proceeded to rise (not jump, just surface) multiple times approximately 50 feet away from the kayaker. This show went on for about 10 minutes. After this they proceeded south down the straight. We would be grateful for any insights into what this behaviour could signify (were we prey or were they simply curious). -Kurt Wipp

We spotted what appeared to be a <b>humpback whale from the beach in Mutiny Bay</b>. It was traveling south. First spotted it closer to <b>Bush Point and lost sight of it near Double Bluff</b>. It was far from shore but we witnessed several breaches and huge splashes. Using binoculars, we could see it slapping the water with giant pectoral fins which is why I'm pretty sure it was a humpback. There were several boats very near it and I'm sure those guys got an amazing show. It was too far for us to photograph. It was within our sight for 30 minutes +. Very cool! I'd be interested to hear if you've had other reports. Feeding and playing. Several breaches (whole body except tail) and slapping the water with large pectoral fins. We first saw it a little before noon and lost sight of it around 1230 if I recall correctly. -Lindsey Goheen

Juan de Fuca - ...yesterday, (Aug 19) I planted myself at around the same time as the previous viewing and saw whale activity around a little point at the <b>east end of Bullman Beach. (Sekiu)</b> I immediately grabbed my camera and headed to the beach. Within minutes there were whales, two this time; an adult and a young one. Seemed there were "lessons" being taught, about stirring up the bottom with their fins.  I followed them down the beach for over 100 yards, shooting as I went. They seemed then to hit a place along the bottom that was not to their liking and they headed out into deeper water. -Scott Hartman

August 18 - WA Coast - <b>Gray whale live strands off Washington Coast</b>. Late Friday night <b>a dramatic rescue</b> effort by members of NOAA Fisheries' West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network freed a young gray whale that had been stranded on a remote beach at Olympic National Park (pictured here Friday morning) for about three days. Successful rescues of stranded large whales are rare, and we're grateful to the many marine mammal experts, National Park Service staff, volunteers and others who dropped everything and hurried to the scene in hopes of saving this whale. A pulley system rigged up in the nick of time helped the team to maneuver the whale into the surf at high tide at 10:19 p.m. and then, suddenly, the whale was gone! "The mission at one point seemed like it was failing with little progress made and the whale not seeming to be able to help and even appearing to turn back toward shore," said John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research Collective. "Then, at the last possible moment, with the whale in about four feet of water in the surf and the harness released, the whale started to swim." "A cheer went up in the darkness and the assembled team stood shining lights into the darkness and mist, stunned at the apparent turn of events and success," Calambokidis recalled. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast - Science &amp; Management

Great to SEA the <b>Transient Killer Whales (T11 &amp; T11a) "Rainy" and "Wakana" </b>east of Sooke hunting close to shore at Williams Head, Pedder Bay &amp; Albert Head on our nautical afternoon tour...Mother and son team. T11 is a 54 year old female and her son, T11A is 39 years old. Although this pair looks almost identical to a Southern Resident Killer Whale, there are many differences. Residents are fish eaters (feeding mainly on Salmon in our waters), Transients are mammal eaters feeding on seals, porpoise, birds, sea lions and young baleen whales. -Paul Pudwell

(<i>August 16th reports from <b>Liberty Bay and Suquamish MAY include 2 different whales of which one is a probable gray</b>. The only documentation received is video from later in the afternoon that we shared with staff at Cascadia Research, John Calambokids replied:

<br/>Friends JUST got here about <b>4:30pm</b> They thought I was just joking when I pointed and screamed "whale". I ran and grabbed the kayaks and we jumped in the water.. Paddled out<b> Manzanita Bay </b>and this is who we found (see video) In all of the excitement, I <b>thought it was a humpback</b> as I paddled with one there last year. But this whale took quick short breaths and 2-3 minute dives. NEVER saw a fluke. Sorry the video isn't better but we were respectfully a good distance away and this is from my cell phone all zoomed in to the max. We paddled with it from along shore as it traveled north to the<b> Agate Pass Bridge (6:00pm)</b> What an amazing experience. Hearing it was a Minke? Feel free to share this video with those who can help us id this guy. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
<br/>(<i>ID notes by John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research: ""I think gray whale from lack of dorsal fin but hard to confirm without seeing coloration."</i>)
<br/>(John Nesby was the first to report this whale, here are his comments after viewing Kim's video: "The motion of this breach looks exactly like what we saw. I'm pretty convinced now that I did not see a dorsal fin, but rather just a raised back followed by the tail (I think in the excitement I assumed all whales have dorsal fins). This sighting was a first for me, in front of my house. But this video very much looks like what we saw. It's hard to compare size from the video but it is certainly similar. I feel like this animal in the video "could" be larger than what I saw.  Lastly the one thing we are both certain of are the white spots. We saw them clearly on the second sighting that was so close to shore. I can't tell from the video if there are spots.  That rolling motion from the video is definitely what we saw yesterday though") 
<br/><b>1:24 p.m. - </b>I'm watching it. It pops just its back up for a moment then takes long dive times. Can't confirm species. No direction of travel. It's been in the same place roughly for the last 20 mins. He/she was too quick. So far no surface behaviors. -Melinda Barajas

<br/><b>12:31 p.m. - </b>they were heading into the bay and I haven't seen them leave yet. A research boat just came in a few minutes ago
<br/><b>11:48 a.m. - Heads up! Whales swimming into Liberty Bay (Poulsbo)</b> right now! Not Orcas, more of a grey looking whale. I'm not an expert at all on whales. I was fishing on Lemolo Point and my son saw them. I thought he was mistaken and saw a seal. Then BOOM! Big show about 75 yards off shore across from Keyport. It was really special to see. We saw an exhale but it wasn't big like I see on TV, it was subtle. They were close enough to the shore (Poulsbo side across from keyport) that we could hear it. They sort of rolled like a wave and yes I think they had a dorsal fin. We saw the backs of them not really the head. My super untrained eye would guess an animal of around 20 feet or so. Also it appeared to have a few white spots on the otherwise grey skin. Almost like big barnacles. We think we saw 2 animals. They went from Lemolo then went out into the wide part of the channel at the mouth of Liberty Bay under the Big Power Lines that cross the bay. (see John's comments above under Kim Malzhan's video). -John Nesby

We are really amazed at the hunting style of the <b>Transient Killer Whales (T60s)</b> They really know how to "hug" the shore line and push through Kelp beds to find their prey! We were fortunate enough to witness at least one quick chomp of a harbour seal that was shared by all the pod...Lost them in the fog south west bound from Beachy Head. -Photo by Paul Pudwell, August 15

<b>At least 3 orcas spotted on a BC ferry leaving Mayne Island today at 5:45pm!</b> They we're pretty close to Mayne, the ferry had only been moving for a few minutes. They must have been heading in the opposite direction of us and back towards Mayne because after they went under and disappeared the whale watch boat that was watching them continued on in the direction we had just come from. I think it was a whale watch boat from Orcas Island? Very exciting to see! -Erin Campbell

August 14 - <b>6:07 p.m. -  they've split. Some are heading north along whidbey shore while the others continue to mill in the same spot.</b>
<br/><b>5:43 p.m. - The encounter at Ebeys Landing</b> even more amazing. They made a kill close to shore. Some breaches and cartwheels and tail lobs. Still milling just off Ebeys Landing.
<br/><b>5:15 p.m. - viewing from Ebeys Landing northbound</b>, further offshore than ft Casey but still easy to see without binos.
<br/><b>4:40 p.m. - Omg they just passed ft Casey insanely close to shore</b>. You could see them under the water swimming. I was shrieking so loud, wow. 4:50 they are pushing NW offshore. <b>Members of the T65As and T99s spend time close to shore off Fort Casey as they were exiting Admiralty Inlet. </b> With the report of whales headed past Lagoon Pt, I rushed over to Ft Casey and made my way to the bluff. You could see the whales headed straight our way. But when <b>they surfaced RIGHT there just offshore</b>, I was freaking out! They were so close to shore, you could see them swimming underwater, their breaths shockingly loud. Then, I headed to Ebey's Landing. The whales weren't far off shore, but not as close as they had been. They went down, when suddenly some went porpoising back south, a few more porpoising from another direction, and yet more from another - the hunt was on! Whatever they went after appeared to dash for shore, as the whales started rapidly heading in towards shore. The water appeared to turn red and the gulls gathered above - the hunt over as quickly as it began. -Rachel Haight

Haro Strait -<b> 7:45 p.m. - Killer whales in Haro Strait around Smuggler's Cove:</b> On Saturday August 12th we went sunset kayaking out of Snug Harbor with Crystal Seas Kayaking, and paddled south hugging the coast. When we reached the Smugglers Cove we saw a Bold Eagle hunting about 200 yards from the coast, we also saw birds circling the area. A few minutes after few spouts were seen and sure enough a group of about<b> 4-5 Killer Whales</b> (probably Transients were moving slowly north, probably through Mosquito Bay when we lost sight of them. A few people also saw them from homes around Smugglers Cove. We were the only ones out there. It was so awesome! traveling slowly northbound. -Patricia Villamill 
<br/>(<i>T60s were ID'd in our last report dated August 14th. This group may have included the T10s who have been traveling with them earlier in the day and days prior. - ALB</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Orca Network Staff, On August 12th at about <b>6 PM, about 4-800 yards into Ludlow Bay, just off Tala Point</b>, in as little as 12 feet of water (by sonar readout), <b>we were surprised by some Orcas while pulling our crab pots</b>. There was <b>a small group of four Orcas</b>, including what appeared to be a Mother, an adolescent, a younger adolescent/older calf and a calf. When I was younger, I worked with Dr. John Lilly for 1 week in Palo Alto; a full summer in Florida and a bit of time at UC Santa Cruz with Dr. Randy S. Wells; and 1 month with Dr. Lewis Herman in Hawaii on their projects. My family has had a condo on the water in Port Ludlow for more than 18 years, and we have never once seen Orcas in the bay. I have seen Gray whales once for about 4 days, porpoises fairly frequently, seals fairly frequently, a sea lion once in a while, and sea otters often. I believe I have correctly IDed the Mother, due to her larger size, but small dorsal fin. We were stopped pulling our pots when we heard the blows and saw them coming at us. <b>They stayed around us anywhere from a couple of hundred yards to as close as 8-10 feet away.</b> They swam around us, and headed away and then back at us several times. The younger adolescent seemed to enjoy approaching us, and did so several times near the end of their time in the bay. Initially, within about 1 - 2 minutes of first seeing them, <b>either the mother or the larger adolescent came abruptly out of the water throwing a seal 10-15 feet into the air</b>, to our great surprise. There was then some roiling of the water in a bit of a frenzy and we never see the seal again. 
<br/>
All three of the younger Orca appeared to be playing and tail slapping the water relatively gently, with one breaching with it's body fully out of the water, but not jumping way up and out, essentially it skimmed across the surface fully out of the water. At one point either the Mother or the adolescent stuck it's head far out of the water, nearly to it's pectoral fins, and seemed to be taking a look at us. The younger adolescent seemed to enjoy swimming near us, and did so, including a small, 1/2 submerged breach behind us. At least three times we thought they were headed back out of the bay, then, we would see them come back our way. We were not sure if they were chasing fish, or just having a good time, or something else entirely. When the Mother, the adolescent and smallest calf finally headed out of the bay permanently the younger adolescent continued to stay and swim around us for several more minutes, and then finally disappeared, and apparently headed out to join the rest on their way out of the bay. When they were a good 1/2 mile away from us and did not seem to be turning around again to come back our way, we finished dealing with our crab pots and headed back to the marina to go home. 
<br/>
This entire event lasted between 35 - 60 minutes, but we were not keeping track of time because we were so amazed they were there at all! I am waiting to receive the videos and photos of them, as sadly, I did not even have my cell phone with me in order to take photos of the mugs, saddle patches nor dorsal fins, which I would have been happy to have done. But, if there are good images when I get them from the others, I will send them along for your database and identification. Of course, I would love to know who we saw if you have them ID, and I suspect you do.  
<br/>Sincerely, Greg C. Brown, M.S., ISA AM.

After hearing reports of the <b>T10s and T60s near the Chain Islets</b>, Dave and Michael headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor around 1020. We finally arrived on scene about <b>four miles south of Discovery Island at about 1100</b>. The whales were in a fairly tight group pointed east at first but soon turned south. The whales zig-zagged quite a bit but generally headed south or southeast. <b>T10C and T60C</b> often dropped behind the others to socialize with one another...<b>T10B was not present during this encounter</b>. We only know of a few T10 encounters in 2017 but T10B has not been seen since 2016...Also, T60C appears to have had someone or something bite him near the top of his dorsal fin... -Full encounter report &amp; photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 61.

August 10 - We had an epic day - minke whale at <b>Salmon Bank, HB south of Beaumont Shoal</b>, and caught up with the <b>T10's and T60's at Smith Island</b> - and saw 4 tufted puffins (the seas were very big, rolley and difficult to take photos). Never seen Smith Island up close and it was as cool as I thought it would be. <b>T60D with T60F doing a spy hop at Smith Island. </b>Lots of seals on a long sandy spit with crashing waves and Ts beside them. Some dilapidated light house on top. Lots of birds nestled in this huge Kelp forest along the island. Puffins flying here or there. Dreamland! -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

After working our way through a spot of fog, Mystic Sea meandered between the San Juan islands and out through San Juan channel into the bigger swells of open water, where we encountered <b>one of our regular Minke whales, 'Nick Jagger', near Salmon Bank.</b> No need to ask why this Minke came by the name, although how Nick got 'the nick' is a mystery. Minkes are known to be rather shy and elusive, but today we were fortunate to see plenty of surface action including the streamlined, tapered head. While some of the growling Steller sea-lions posed and vied for the best position on Whale Rocks, others were content to doze in the hazy sunshine. Bald eagles and basking Pacific harbor seals with pups heightened our already rich wildlife viewing itinerary as we sailed past Lopez on our return to Anacortes. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

They were actually already <b>past Race Rocks and heading easterly</b> when we encountered the trailing group at <b>1222</b>. This group consisted of <b>L90, L91 and her son L122, L92, L72 and her son L105, L83 and her son L110, L47 and her son L115</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:55 a.m. -</b> I saw it again about 10 minutes ago. It went down for a deep dive. This time I saw it slightly farther north, closer to Salt Water. It appears to be hanging out in this area with no definite direction at this point. The whale's head was facing away from me so I didn't get a good look at the dorsal fin, only the fluke on the deep dive. What I can confidently say is that this was a much bigger whale than the juvenile humpbacks that have been near Tacoma. ...It was amazingly close to Redondo when I saw it this morning. I've never seen a humpback there. It certainly <b>looked like a humpback</b> to me.
<br/><b>10:24 a.m. - </b>I am at <b>Saltwater state park</b> right now and I just saw a large whale (humpback?) surface twice farther south towards Poverty Bay. Visibility is poor but there are also numerous porpoises or common dolphins close to the salt water shore. -Heidi Vincent

A few of us so excited and screaming LOL. loved it...orca's can sure bring people together. Watched, first from the bluff at Sandy Point looking east towards northern tip of<b> Hat Island</b> and Everett in the background behind the smoky haze, very washed out, so washed out and hazy, when I had first seen the orcas this morning (thanks Alisa and Orca Network) high above Sandy Point looking westerly, cannot see Everett at all. When Phee and I first saw them from the Brighton Beach area, they were west of Hat Island and east of Whidbey Island. Orcas continued traveling south towards Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes..orcas were more near us or no further mid channel vs closer to Hat Island. Then watched from Glendale across towards Mukilteo, as orcas continued mid channel southbound. -Marilyn Armbruster

<b>11:05 a.m. - from Cascade Ave on the bluff above Langley Marina</b>, I first saw one male surfacing mid channel steady southbound between the marina and Camano Head.

The pod was loosely spread as they all continued heading towards Sandy Point, Whidbey at steady pace southbound. Blues skies enveloped by smokey haze from Canada's wildfires. Seas flat calm.

An orca came and swam with me on the first day of my 86km history making <b>swim around Saltspring Island</b>. The encounter happened around<b> 3:ooPM </b>on August 1st. There were <b>4 or 5 orcas, and one came and swam with me for a while</b>, while I sang it a First Nations Whale Song. It came within a mere inches and approached from different directions hanging out with me for a couple of minutes. Never touched me but came so close as if inviting my touch. The song was as much connection as I could muster. But it was a very beautiful experience. Here is a LINK to a video of what we caught of the encounter. -Rama DelaRosa

August is here and our trip today took us on a totally different route - via Deception Pass to Saratoga Passage and south to <b>Crescent Harbor</b> - by the Navy's old Seaplane base in Oak Harbor. We found a family of <b>transient/Biggs killer whales, 5 of them - Matriarch T46 (est. born 1964), T46D (born 2000), T46E (born 2003)...</b>, checking out the harbor. We had great views of this family (T46s) before turning for home, via another fun route, the Swinomish Channel through LaConner! Great sightseeing, with an osprey, bald eagles, herons, seals, and much more before reaching home port. You never quite know which direction the Mystic Sea will take - but it's always a fun day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
