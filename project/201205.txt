The <b>T036A's, T065A's, and the T099's</b> were south of <b>Discovery Island</b>. They spent most of the day socializing and vocalizing.
<br/>Mark Malleson,Prince of Whales
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 orcas</b>, heading W more or less. Spent 30 mins circling the boat with a few half hearted leaps, and some bubble blowing.<b> 19:35</b> at 48 17' 26 - 123.59.01 (<b>Middle of Strait of Juan de Fuca, west of Sooke</b>).
<br/>Jonathan Michienzi
<br/>*<br/>
<b>T65A and T65A4, her new calf, off Discovery Island</b>. Lots of breaching and playing, a harbor seal kill and mostly playful whales. T65A just sat there rostrum pointed towards me and watched me for 5 minutes. It was weird behavior. Russ Nicks was with me as well.
<br/>Josh McInnes 
<br/>*<br/> 
All of our best guesses were that the residents had gone out to the ocean Wednesday evening. I was happy to hear of some <b>Transient Orcas near Victoria</b> and figured that was where I was headed on our <b>12:00</b> sailing. However...at 11:30 I got a call that there were <b>Residents near Lime Kiln</b>! Oh yes! I called our naturalist, Jeanne Hyde, who wasn't going to be with us that morning. She was totally surprised since she had not heard any vocalizations on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. She came running and off we went! We spotted Orcas off of Lime Kiln in about 15 minutes, out in the fog. <b>All of J Pod, most of the Ks and old L87</b>, now a J Pod member! It was a most unusual day. They were very quiet on our first trip, doing a lot of milling. We came out again at 3:00 and they went back to their usual behavior, with a lot of breaching and playing around.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/> 
Whales were spotted passing <b>Lime Kiln lighthouse at about 11:15 a.m.</b> On Maya's Westside Charters a short while later we located <b>J and K pods and L-87</b> in a tight group heading for Discovery Island. It was an unusual encounter as the whales stopped for several minutes, bunched up, at first all aiming the same direction. Then some changed their position facing the other direction. After almost 5 minutes of this they all went under. The next whale to surface was <b>Granny J-2</b> who appeared to be leading the way. They zigged and zagged up Haro Strait all afternoon. Late in the day we left them at Turn Pt. looking like they were heading up Swanson Channel. Pictures and more of the encounters of the day are posted on my blog: Whale of A Purpose
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/> 
A report of Transients off <b>Lime Kiln </b>that ended up being <b>J's and K's</b>!! It was a little foggy and overcast as they slowly headed north in a resting pattern. The combination of all the whales surfacing at the same time and the weather made for a really cool setting and a very relaxing show.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
WOW what an amazing day on the water with <b>J Pod and K Pod</b>!! They were all grouped up resting for most of the day. So spectacular to see over 48 Orcas all grouped up with a few spyhops to check us out!
<br/>Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching
<br/>*<br/>
Transients: <b>T30, T30A, T30B, her calf T30B1</b> (which was first seen April 5th) and <b>T30C </b>were traveling west in <b>Spieden Channel at 6:15 p.m</b>. They were closer to the shoreline along Spiden Island.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
A group of around <b>20 orcas</b>, well spread out, passed by <b>Thieves Bay, Pender Island between 6.15 and 6.45pm</b>. We just caught the tail end as the last three passed. 
<br/>Ian Pirie
<br/>*<br/>
My boyfriend and I were out on the water today, and this afternoon at <b>1530 off of Tounge Point (Crescent Bay) On the Straits Of Juan De Fuca</b> .. Lat/Lon: 48.18°N 123.71°W .  West of <b>Port Angeles</b>. There was <b>a single female Orca Heading out west</b>. She was doing a cruzing speed and would surface 2 times then disappear for about 8-10 minutes surface 2 more times then she was gone for a good 10 or more minutes. We heard her blow about a mile away but never saw her again.. Strange to see a female Orca out on her own. Wish I could have gotten a pic or 2 of her.
<br/>Sandy Watne
<br/>*<br/>
Ron Pool called with a report of seeing a<b>n orca about a mile offshore, about 1 - 2 pm, about a mile north of Crescent City CA</b> (by the green can). He saw the poster with the number to call.
<br/>*<br/>
I am not sure if these are the same killer whales that were sighted off <b>Quileute</b> last night, but we saw about <b>4-5 killer whales</b> on the East side of<b> Carroll Island</b> headed South at around <b>6:30 PM </b>.  
<br/>Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician, Makah Fisheries Management
<br/>*<br/>
USCG Petty Officer Francisco Comunidad called to report of <b>5 orcas off Quileute today at 2103</b>, heading south. Coordinates were 47.53.9 x 124.39.1. No photos.

Encounter # 24 * <b>J,K, pods in southern Haro Strait</b> (with photos)
<br/>Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender
<br/>Around <b>noon </b>we received reports of groups of whales heading <b>down Rosario Strait and at Hein Bank</b>. The reports said that all three pods were present, so we headed out in hopes of getting some follow up photos of new calf L119 who was seen for the first time the previous day. We departed Snug Harbor at 1:45 p.m. with overcast skies and light wind. We encountered whales about <b>2 miles west of Iceberg Point on Lopez Island</b>. The whales were spread out in singles and small groups milling and moving generally SW. Although L's had earlier been reported in the area, we only encountered mixed groups of J's and K's. We came across a few fun groups of socializing juveniles. They were rolling and tactile with a few sea snake appearances. <b>J39, J42, K34 and J45</b> were in the first group, joined briefly by <b>J40 and J41</b>. We left that group, thinking about heading home when we came upon another tight tactile group of juveniles. <b>K36, K37, K43 and K42</b> were milling and rolling around, heading out toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We ended the encounter about 10 miles west of<b> Cattle Point at 4:21 p.m</b>. returning to Snug by 5 p.m.
Whales photographed: <b>J8, J14, J17, J19, J26, J28, J36, J39, J40, J41, J42, J44, J45, J47, K12, K14, K25, K26, K27, K34, K36, K37, K42, K43, K44, and L87</b>
<br/>*<br/>
2 recent reports of likely the same group of KWs heading north on 30 May: At <b>1055 hrs</b>, 41.47014 -124.06633 which is Carruther's Cove at the
north end of Gold Bluff beach, <b>Prairie Creek State Park (50 miles north of Eureka</b> and 25 miles south of Crescent City CA), four biologists observed <b>four killer whales</b> traveling slowly north, 75 m offshore. 
<br/>Then in the evening, around <b>1800 </b>the keepers of the lighthouse at <b>Crescent City</b> saw <b>four KWs</b> slowly traveling north close to shore, watched them for over a half an hour. In both sightings no males were described, only similar sized medium females, no calves.
<br/>Jeff K Jacobsen
<br/>*<br/>
At between <b>1:30 and 2:00 PM</b> a <b>small pod of orcas</b> was spotted about 1/4 mile off <b>Heceta Head in central Oregon</b>. The pod consisted of 1 male and 4 to 6 females/juveniles. They circled the same spot with occasional breaching of a juvenile. The pod was circled by a USCG HH-45 for several minutes.
<br/>Carl Greenbaum
<br/>*<br/>
Ocean Research College Academy (ORCA) spotted <b>gray whale #53 south of Hat Island</b> around <b>12:15 PM</b> today.
<br/>Robin Araniva
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>8:30 a.m. Raggedy K-40, Cappuccino K-21, Opus K-16, Sonata K-35, Wave Walker L-88, Grace L-2, and Gaia L-78</b> passed by <b>Lime Kiln lighthouse</b> going down island. These seven whales were spread across Haro Strait from a few hundred yards offshore to 3 or more miles offshore. At<b> 2:00 pm </b>on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered J<b> pod, Onyx L-87 and the rest of the K pod whales </b>as they headed west along the bottom end of <b>Lopez and San Juan Island</b>. Many were in small groups showing playful surface behaviors. Pictures on my blog post from that day are at:  Whale of A Purpose.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:30 pm - </b>Just spotted <b>two orcas between navy channel and active pass</b> while passing by on the ferry. Nice!
<br/>Ken Stockley
<br/>*<br/>
Members of <b>J-pod, K-pod, and L-Pod</b> where traveling together again today out in Rosario Strait just southwest of <b>Lopez Island</b> at approximately <b>1:00 PM</b>; coordinates 48°24.051N 122°50.23W. Within a few minutes of reaching the area, the Sea Lion (our boat) was surrounded by whales on all sides! It didn't matter in which direction we looked everyone was bound to see the whales surface. And man did it seem like they were in their realm!! We saw almost every behavior possible; from spyhopping to lobtailling to pectoral slapping to breaching. We even got so see a few calves rolling around belly up and wrestling with one another. Just adorable! Once we saw this behavior we immediately dropped the hydrophone and listened in. They were vocalizing as one would expect, with such a big group, chattin' up a storm. The crew and passengers really appeared to be beside themselves listening in and watching an entirely different community communicate and move as one. Today it really struck home that this world is not solely ours, rather we share it with many other amazing creatures.
<br/>Naturalist Tara, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
John Rogstad of WA State Ferries Operations called at <b>10:11 am</b> to say the captain of the ferry Elwha sighted about <b>10 orcas in Rosario Strait</b>, about even with Anacortes, heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:42am -</b> No doubt about it, <b>K pod on LK</b>!!!
<br/><b>8:18am - </b>started hearing calls on <b>OrcaSound </b>hydrophone.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
John Rogstad of WA State Ferries called at <b>6:38 am</b> to report that the ferry Evergreen State found <b>four orcas</b> at Danger Rock, west of <b>Lopez Island</b>.

Encounter # 23 * <b>J,K,L pods in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> (with photos)
<br/>Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender
<br/>After receiving several reports of lots of whales heading in near Sooke, CWR staff left in Orca at 1055 to intercept them after topping off with fuel in Roche Harbor. At 
<b>1206, we arrived on scene and found J and K pods plus L87 and the L2's</b> in a tight formation heading slowly east 
<b>off the Victoria waterfront</b> (48 21.757N 123 26.811). We left this group at 1217 still west of Trial Island to check out the rest of L pod who were also heading east about two miles to the south. 
<br/>We got on L pod at 1225 as they traveled slowly east in two tight groups loosely separated with the L12 subpod being slightly behind the rest of the L's.  We were able to confirm a report from earlier in the day that <b>L77 had a new calf. L119</b> would be L77's second known calf. Her first, L114, was born in early 2010 but was only seen once before it disappeared. <b>L90</b> survived the winter and was seen traveling with the L26's after her late summer 2011 health scare although she still seems to have a stiff surfacing motion. However, <b>noticeably missing from L pod was L5, an estimated 47 year old female, and L12, an estimated 78 year old female</b>. We will wait for a couple more good encounters with L pod before writing them off to make sure they were not just missed. If these two remain missing, the Southern Resident population will have lost four whales this year so far since L112 washed up dead on the Washington Coast in February 2012, including J30 who has not been seen since last December. With the loss of four whales and the addition of L119, <b>the Southern Resident population currently stands at 85</b>.
<br/>We stayed with L pod as they continued slowly east in a resting formation until 1355 when we headed back to the J's and K's who had just passed through Enterprise Channel between Trial Island and the south tip of Vancouver Island. The J's, K's, L2's, and L87 were milling easterly in a tight group in the tidal slop off the Golf course at Gonzales Point. We photographed the whales in this group until 1500 when we left them to find the L pod calf again. L pod woke up, sped up, and spread out as they approached Seabird Pt. on Discovery Island. We followed a few spread out L pod whales, including L77 and L119, as they headed east across Haro Strait in lumpy seas toward San Juan Island.  Most of the L's were pointed toward False Bay or further south and we left them around 1620 and began bouncing north toward home, photographing a few spread out whales along the way. The last whales we found were a loose group including <b>J27, J31, J39, J28, J46, J22, and J34 </b>that surfed north in three foot seas. We ended the encounter at 1642 off the west side of San Juan Island (48 29.118N 123 08.134W) and were back at Snug Harbor at 1705. 
<br/>The <b>J's, K's, L2's, and L87 traveled north fast past CWR at 1805</b> and the rest of <b>L pod stayed to the south and presumably headed back west</b> out the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the night.
<br/>*<br/>
We spent some time with <b>J &amp; K pod</b> at the Victor Hotel buoy (south of Ogden Point in <b>Victoria</b>); they were traveling close together, lots of fins in the air at once, and looked like they were covering ground--just surfacing and breathing, no fin slapping or other playful behaviors.  Identified <b>J2, J8, J17s, J22s, K 21, K40, and L87</b> for sure...many other whales there who I'm not as familiar with and weren't posing for the cameras as much.  Granny is looking great, it has been so nice to see her over the past couple weeks!
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist, Victoria Clipper III
<br/>*<br/>
Between <b>6-6:45pm</b> GMT from the <b>Lime Kilm Hydrophone's</b> recorded on my Ipod Touch. Sounds like they were having a party!
<br/>Natalka Lindstrom
<br/>*<br/>
From the Center for Whale Research - <b>the birth of a new L pod calf, L119, is confirmed! Born to 25 year old L77, Matia, L119 is L77's 2nd calf</b>, though her 1st calf, L114, born in 2010, died the same year. We are hopeful for the future of L119, every whale addition makes a huge difference for the survival of the endangered Southern Resident orcas. The encounter summary and photos of the new calf will be posted tomorrow on the <a href="http://www.whaleresearch.com/">Center for Whale Research website</a>. Further encounters will be needed to determine whether all members are present.
<br/>*<br/>
Residents are back!! Nice to see them home and looked like all of them! We spent most of our time around <b>Trial Island</b> with a mix of <b>J's K's and L's</b> resting. I heard there was another group offshore with a new calf (L Pod). We had <b>K21, K40, J27, L78, L100</b> and may more. Awesome day!
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
Super Pod (<b>J, K, and L Pod</b>) was hanging out in <b>Victoria </b>today. Went from Sooke this morning down around Trial Island and Oak Bay Marina. Great afternoon Whale watching from the car.
<br/>Dave Nicholson
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 pm - Serious super-pod sounds on the San Juan Hydrophone</b>, beautiful clicks and spectacular whistles!
<br/>Raven Altona
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:27 - </b>Lots of <b>calls </b>getting closer and closer on <b>LK Hydrophone</b> right now.
<br/>Pam Ren
<br/>*<br/>
Super Pod! We traveled all the way to Victoria BC to see three different pods of Southern Resident Killer Whales. When multiple pods of whales come together it is called a super pod!  
Members of the <b>J- and K-pods were traveling together</b>, moving through Enterprise Channel <b>between Victoria and Trial Island</b> (48 24.46N, 12318.64W), with individuals from <b>L-pod roughly 1 mile offshore</b>. The whales were traveling in an easterly direction. We were all captivated by the whales. At times over 20 whales were seen surfacing, including a number of mature males. Super pods only occur a handful of times during the season; such a treat to see so many whales together! A truly AMAZING day out here in the San Juan Islands!

We encountered a <b>lone gray whale</b> just off the Edmonds ferry dock as we were heading home on Monday night. It was northbound, a little before <b>7 pm</b>. The water was too choppy to get a good look for an ID, but I wonder if it was the same one we saw in the same area a couple weekends ago?

Encounter # 22 - T10's in Haro Strait. Observers: Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit and Erin Heydenreich
<br/>We overheard a report of <b>Transients in Haro Strait</b> on the radio around <b>4:00 P.M.</b> We departed Snug at 4:10 p.m. and headed across Haro Strait toward Kelp Reef. We encountered the <b>T10's (T10, T10B and T10C)</b> in a loose group heading slowly NW. Within a half hour they spread out and were heading up Haro Strait close to Sidney Island. We left them at <b>5:10</b> still moving slowly NE. Whales photographed: T10, T10B and T10C
<br/>*<br/>

Maybe <b>4:00 pm - orca sighting georgia straight</b>, Orca pod, <b>at least 3, maybe 4</b>, 1 larger and longer with larger fin (probably male). Latitude 49 degrees 28 minutes north, Longitude 123 degrees 55 minutes west. Travelling north between Halfmoon Bay on the Sunshine Coast of BC and Merry Island...casual surface travel, cruising. We viewed them from our cottage on Halfmoon Bay high bank. Unusual for this area!  Amazing....

From Bellhouse Park on Galiano Island today around <b>2:30</b>, we watched <b>2 whales leisurely feed off the east entrance to Active Pass</b>. These were definitely not orcas. From the whale watching we have done in Hawaii, these behaved like humpbacks. They were big, slow moving, small dorsal fin, did tail slaps and a half body breach (Gary saw white splotches on the flecked underbelly), rounded back before diving, raised tail on diving, large blows. Pretty exciting.

Encounter # 21 * T19's off Henry Island
<br/>Observers: Ken Balcomb
<br/>Around 6:15 PM, Ken heard Jim Maya and Spencer on the VHF talking about a male and a female (presumably killer whales) somewhere between <b>Kellett Bluff and Battleship Island</b>. At <b>6:34 PM</b>, he cast off in "Shachi" to check out the sighting report, and at <b>6:53 PM T19 and T19B</b> were encountered about one mile south of <b>Stuart Island</b>. The whales were headed northwest toward Turn Point in plodding fashion, with the male (T19B) taking egular but long dives. The female (mum T19) behaved more cryptic and less regular in her dives before crossing to mid-strait and joining with her other offspring, T19C, who appears to be "sprouting", i.e., showing sign of maturing with allometric growth of the dorsal fin. There had been four whales reported, but it seems that this might be explained by mum alternately swimming with her sons that were about one half mile apart as they headed northwest. They rounded Turn Point and headed <b>into Boundary Pass at 7:13 PM</b>, altering course slightly to north toward Blunden Island before the encounter ended at 7:20 PM near the Canada border. No predation was observed or suspected during this brief encounter at the end of a beautiful day in the Pacific Northwest. Two by two, the pelagic cormorants were returning to the ledge at Turn Point, and the osprey stood guard at its nest at Kellett Bluff as the sun was setting.

6+ transients 5nm</div></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html> east of <b>Thrasher Rock</b> (Southern tip of Gabriola Island near Nanaimo), heading NW. When we arrived on scene, we encountered <b>a female with a young calf, its skin still dark orange</b>. The mother appeared to be <b>T65</b>, but no confirmation was made on scene, as the mother/calf pair quickly changed direction and headed in toward the shore. This left us with a group of 4 transients several hundred yards out from the mother/calf.
These four animals (which were identified as <b>T65A, T65A2, and two others</b>, IDs still pending) grouped up and spread apart at least twice as we watched them for 40 minutes, and at one point, converged into a small milling cluster, possibly having killed something. After that, they began to travel more rapidly NW in a line, almost porpoising but not quite.

We were on our way to see the whales that were spotted in the San Juan Islands when a fisherman reported seeing some Orca around Gabriola Island. We changed course and within 40 minutes we found the group of <b>8 animals about 3 miles offshore of Gabriola</b>. It was a mix of a couple different groups and they were spread but we did ID <b>T65A and T36A with T36A1 and, what looked like,a new calf! (T36A2)?</b> It was a perfect day as we followed them west and great to see a new addition to the transient population.

Transients Orcas and Summer weather! Fantastic day on the water:  treated to clear skies, summery temps, and a stunning view of Mt. Baker, we traveled north out of Friday Harbor, around the north side of Orcas Island, until catching up with <b>Transient Orcas on the north side of Lummi Island around 1:45 p.m.</b> Counts varied, depending on who you talked to, but we finally agreed on <b>7 total</b>. Latitude 48°44' Longitude 122°45'. As mesmerized as we were by the orcas, it was hard not to notice the many pairs of Rhinocerus Auklets calmly floating by, as well as a pair of Loons. Our day would not be complete without a Bald Eagle sighting, which was our final reward when a stately adult sailed overhead as we entered back into the marina.

A bunch of us were treated to <b>a small pod of orcas Sunday in Port Orford, OR</b>. We were just getting ready to go scuba diving when they appeared- they actually swam through our entry point. Not sure if there's a place to report Oregon sightings, but I figured I would start with your site. We talked to another diver who encountered what sounds like a different pod the day before while spearfishing an offshore reef near Port Orford- he described the whales as having noticeably tall dorsal fins, which doesn't sound like the ones we saw.  Here's a link to the video I shot. I figured they were transients. Right after they left, three of us did a dive and when I surfaced there was a harbor seal hanging out a little closer to shore than I would have expected :) We were shocked that they came right into the exact area we use as an entry and exit for our dives- they never would have fit if it hadn't been high tide.  It looked like one of them was skritching itself on the rocks.  At that point I was trying to get some stills- I wish I had the presence of mind to run down there and dunk my camera for some close ups. Intellectually, we know that they don't bother humans but still- the idea of being in the water with them is thrilling and scary at the same time. I'm attaching links to 2 pics I put on facebook- one is about the only decent still I got, and the other shows just how constricted the area is that they went through.

Today we caught up with a group of <b>4 Transient Orcas off the southwestern end of Victoria</b>; coordinates 48°22.0'N, 123°25.0'W. This group was not as stealthy as we typically see with Transients. They were surfacing multiple times, almost in a predictable manner, and were lobtailling often with a couple spyhops here and there. This group was also quite young; two younger calves and two adults who appeared to be in their 20s. We got to travel with them for about 20 minutes or so until we headed back for San Juan Island.

A report was sent to Orca Network from onboard a commercial fishing vessel <b>~40 mi SW of Cape Flattery about ~40 orcas in tight groups heading S-SW</b>. They were too far away for any ID photos. <b>Initial sighting was made at 5:00am</b>. I saw a few females with open right saddles, but couldn't make any positive IDs. They were in the same vicinity as <b>two humpbacks</b>. The whales stayed with us for about 2 hours, and a female with a calf made a close pass across our bow. I only got one look with no photo confirmation, but I'm about 90% sure it was <b>J16 with J42</b>. The only other similar looking saddle at that distance is K20, but I don't think it was her based on the dorsal shape.

Another amazing day out here in the San Juan Islands; we had beautiful blue skies, sunshine, flat calm waters, and <b>Minke Whales</b>! As we rounded Cattle Point, at the southern end of San Juan Island, we found <b>three Minke Whales near Hein Bank</b> (48°21.66N, 123°03.34W). The whales appeared to be busy foraging in these highly productive waters. At times the whales could be seen from both sides of the boat providing awesome photo and viewing opportunities. We were all smiles spending time with these normally shy and elusive whales. On our way back north we saw a California Sea Lion taking a siesta on a channel buoy. Then we stopped at Whale Rocks where we found a large, male Steller Sea Lion climbing out of the water onto shore. We were all mesmerized by his agility, using all four of his flippers to move about and walk on land. He provided us with a few poses before leaping back into the water producing a cannon-ball size splash. A stop at Long Island provided us with an opportunity to see an active Bald Eagles nest while a mature bald eagle soared in the skies above. What a great day out here on the water!

At approximately <b>1100 </b>today (23 May 2012), a US Navy small boat conducting operations in and around Gardner Bay spotted <b>two separate pods of orcas</b>. Our approximate position was 1 nautical mile <b>southeast of Gedney Island</b>. <b>One pod had 5-6 members</b> and was traveling southwesterly, in the direction of Mukilteo. <b>The second pod had approximately 2-4 members</b>. They were 1 mile southwest of us (therefore, approximately two miles directly south of Gedney Island). We were too distant from them to determine specific numbers or direction of movement. The nature of their activity seemed to be transit.

We left them about halfway between the mainland and Whidbey, heading northwest-ish towards Brighton Beach.

<b>J pod </b>in its entirety (including L87 of course) reported near <b>Hein Bank</b>. When we arrived on scene, they were widely spread out, so much so that the only whales we could find were the <b>J22s with J32</b>. The four of them were not traveling in any direction, but instead milling in a tight cluster, likely catching salmon as we saw at least two bursts of speed at the surface. They would rise for 4-5 slow breaths at the surface, then disappear for 4-5 minutes. A few small spyhops here and there, but other than that, they seemed pretty preoccupied with chomping salmon below the waves.

We traveled around to the south end of the San Juan Island and found the <b>Resident Killer Whales about 2 miles southwest of Hein Bank</b> (48°22.25N, 123°06.56W). Everyone was mesmerized by <b>at least five members of J-pod</b>. The whales were initially very surface active: spy-hopping, breaching, tail slapping, and cartwheeling. They had short dive times and changed direction frequently. We took this opportunity to lower the hydrophone and listen to the whale vocalizations. AMAZING! The whales then appeared to enter a resting phase, as they lined up in a row and traveled slowly together. When it was time to leave the whales had increased their dive times and appeared to be traveling to the southwest.

I watched them from my home in Redondo Beach. This is the first time I've seen them off Redondo in my 55 years living here. I did see a big Gray Whale out front of my house about 4 weeks ago.

Today we traveled north into Canadian waters and caught up with about <b>7 or 8 members of J-Pod just off Point Roberts</b>; coordinates: 48°56.97N, 123°10.25W. As we arrived on the scene the whales were quite spread out allowing guests to look in every direction and see at least one or two. A few members of the pod were lobtailing and a curious male even began spyhopping to check out the scene. It really was amazing to see just how large these animals can be with only half of their bodies rising above the surface. As we started heading back, we caught up with Western Prince who had 3 more members of J-pod traveling parallel to them. We got to ride alongside this group for a while longer, watching them rise and dive multiple times.

They were with the <b>T10s, T10B and T10C</b>. Shortly after we left the scene, the four were joined by at least 9 other transients. Wow, what are they up to?? They were taking 2 minute dives, and swimming just under the surface, as we could see the their white eye patches and flank patches flashing just under the waves. They were making a slow and steady pace north, and were not exhibiting the "super stealth" mode of hunting transients.

We had a message from Mike Sullivan of Bainbridge Island, WA, reporting seeing some splashes and small dorsal fins from the <b>Seattle to Bainbridge ferry, at about 3:15 pm</b>. He was watching what appeared to be <b>1 - 3 orcas</b>, 100 - 150 yards to the north of the ferry, splashing and swimming toward Seattle.
<br/><i>With no other sightings of orcas, but some reports of porpoises in the area, these may have been porpoises.</i>

We had <b>a Gray Whale</b> on today's hourly tours right under <b>Deception Pass Bridge</b> in Canoe Pass!

Jay Lark called from the <b>Depoe Bay</b>, Oregon Whale Center (saw a poster) to report <b>a killer whale 1.5 miles up the Umpqua River</b> at Winchester Bay, swimming lazily upriver, at <b>2 pm</b>. It had a large dorsal fin.
<br/>*<br/>
While camping in our RV @ the <b>Winchester Bay Oregon</b> RV resort, we spotted <b>an Orca</b> heading East toward Salmon Harbor. The dorsal fin was at least 3'-4' high and very straight. It looked like he was feeding as there was a very large splash followed by a lot of thrashing. He then turned around and headed out across the bar. The sighting was @ <b>2:30 pm</b>. We could not identify any other markings.

Across from <b>Cattle Point</b> (south end of San Juan Island) we reached our first hot spot for wildlife viewing. We didn't have to go very far, about 500 yards, and we saw <b>two Minke Whales</b>! The water couldn't have been better for viewing today! The Minkes broke through what appeared to be glass. They were so smooth in their actions and so flawless. Fortunately, we were able to cut the motor and stay with the Minkes for a while, it appeared they were enjoying their situation and had no intentions on leaving.

I just off the Shimada and while I was out there I took these shots. There were <b>3 whales spotted about 15 miles west of Pt Reyes CA</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
Norm at KOMO TV called (<b>2:35 pm</b>) from a chopper above <b>Jetty Island</b>, just off Everett, saying they were watching <b>a gray whale</b> stirring up mud in shallow water. 
<br/>*<br/>
As we reached <b>Hein Bank</b>, coordinates 48 degrees 20.80 minutes N, 123 degrees 04.089 minutes W, we slowed to almost a stop. Minke whales are difficult to spot because they have a low blow, a small dorsal fin, and if there are waves they tend to block our view. But, we definitely had no trouble today as <b>a minke</b> surfaced right ahead of our boat! And because the water was so flat we saw more of the body than I'd ever seen before. We spent some time watching that lone minke surface and dive methodically around our boat before heading back towards Salmon Bank. Again, it didn't take very long before we spotted two more minke whales! (Coordinates 48 degrees 24.53 minutes N, 122 degrees 59.06 minutes W). Their blows were audible and their smooth, rounded backs sliced through the glassy water again and again, keeping us mesmerized.

<br/>*<br/>
At least <b>two groups of transients</b> were sighted moving north, northwest through <b>Porlier Pass</b> (north end of Galiano Island) about <b>2:30 pm</b>. We caught up with<b> T87, possibly T90, and one other female with a calf </b>(appeared to be at least 2 years old). Further off the Valdez Island shoreline was <b>T102 </b>with at least 5 others, including two younger juveniles. It was frustrating to not be able to ID the younger animals and females! They continued to make their way north up the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, taking steady long dives and surfacing in a scattered formation. There was some predation going on, because when we arrived on scene the gulls were hovering around and picking yummy bits of flesh off the surface. Two roaming gangs of transients out and about today, each at the polar opposite ends of the islands! They were covering all their bases it seems!

The Captain received word that Transient Orca Whales were around, but we would need to boat at least an additional 30 minutes to get there. Off we went again. We arrived on scene at Lat. 48.12.57 - Long. 123.15.29 (8-10 miles <b>NW of Dungeness Spit</b>). At first we did not see anything, then after 10 minutes - whale breath and dorsal fins. We counted <b>6 Transient Killer Whales</b>. There was not a pattern to their movement and they did not appear to be hunting.

<br/>*<br/>
The whales encountered while on Maya's Westside Charters, in the afternoon from <b>3 to 4 pm</b>, were <b>T10, T10B, T10C, T26, T26A, T77, T77B, T77C and T77D</b>.  We were not far from <b>Dungeness Spit</b>. When first arriving on scene they were in three groups. Eventually they came together and began moving slowly northeast. We left them heading in that direction at 4:00 p.m.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>Minkes </b>do not spend much time at the surface at all - so one must keep their eyes moving over the water alert to the small dorsal fin. We stayed in the area about ½ an hour to watch them surface 3 times.  We were at Lat.48.21.9 - Long.122.56.72 (a few miles <b>south of Cattle Pass</b>).

We got really lucky just as we reached Turn Point, <b>a humpback whale</b> was spotted north of <b>East Point</b>! It was decision time; continue our course, or extend our trip and go for it. We decided to go for it and headed further north. And was it worth it! The humpback whale blew magnificently in the distance. We watched as it surfaced a few times before flashing its fluke in a fluke up dive.

We found the whales 1.5 miles offshore from <b>Lime Kiln Point</b> (48°32.49'N, 123°10.71'W). The whales were members of <b>J-Pod</b>.  They were spread out, and cruising along the coast headed south. A member of the <b>L-Pod, L87 "Onyx"</b>, was also seen among the J's. Unfortunately the seas were deteriorating and the whales were headed into rougher waters, unusual for San Juan Islands, so we turned around and headed back to more sheltered waters.

The Residents are being seen in all directions! We looped around <b>San Juan</b> to the west side and were able to catch up with four individuals from <b>J-Pod</b>. There was one large male, a female, and two calves. As we traveled with the group along the shoreline, just past East Point (Saturna Island), they milled around, and the calves began breaching a few times here and there! After about 15 minutes they changed direction and immediately gained speed heading north. We got to travel with them for a few more miles and in that time, the large male even breached!

<br/>*<br/>
We spotted the first dorsal fin at <b>Robert's Bank</b>, immediately followed by another. We followed the first two whales for about 15 minutes and had to start heading back, but just as the boat gained speed we spotted another two. Then we started seeing several more orcas, both off in the distance, and as close as 200 yards away. The passengers and crew grew very excited and it seemed as though the Residents fed off our excitement. A young calf started breaching, followed by an older member of the pod lobtailing, and another spy hopping. It was an amazing site to see! We then continued to travel with the <b>Residents </b>for a significant amount of time as we made our way back home.

<b>1:50 pm - Minke or humpback</b>. Stasha Decker called from just <b>south of Whidbey NAS</b> (northwest Whidbey Island) to say she's watching a large black whale moving south and lifting its flukes.
<br/><i>Fluking indicates a humpback</i>.
<br/>*<br/>
I have to say I think it was a Minke Whale due to the distinct fin I saw as the whale rolled across the surface. It looked like the Whale Boat out of Anacortes was following it North to South, about a hundred yards off the shore along the Naval Air Station today, at just about noon. Looked like he/she was alone?

"Spouting News" - BIRDSEYE VIEW OF ORCA POD  - Around <b>7PM </b>this evening, on the 6:45PM Kennewick ferry from<b> Port Townsend to Coupeville</b>; we were treated to <b>ORCAS</b>!! Lots of them, spread out over a mile; maybe, up to 2 miles. Resident or transient pod??? Difficult, to guess how many, 15? More? Viewing them/looking down from the ferry "top deck" was also a neat experience. Lots of tail/fluke splashes as quite a number of orcas got into the act. Contagious? Spouts, tall dorsal fins out on display, along, with some frolicking. Also, the "top deck" provided a birdseye view. Seeing lots of white on their sides/underbellies; when several surfaced close-by. Orcas are magnificent. I grew in my appreciation for them immensely this evening/watching them do their thing. As the Kennewick continued east to Whidbey Island, the orcas were heading south towards Marrowstone Island to get ready for the sunset.

From <b>Lagoon Point</b>, watching some <b>J pod and K pod orcas</b>, and <b>maybe the L2's</b> if it's the same group that was up on the San Juans yesterday, probably about 30-35 whales in all. At <b>6:45 pm</b> they were way spread far apart, from mid channel off <b>Pt. Wilson to many miles south of Port Townsend</b>, a good eight to ten miles apart, all within our view from 8-10 miles away at about 250 feet elevation. We were seeing blows, dorsals, taillobs and a spyhop, all backlit by the setting sun, for over an hour. Almost always one or another group was at the surface doing something. Then a few minutes after 8 pm they just disappeared. We watched for about 55 minutes afterward and never saw another sign of an orca until dark. This was an amazing disappearing act. So we don't know which way they went.

The sun was shining high in the sky as we left Friday Harbor this afternoon. We headed south, far south, enjoying the natural beauty of the islands along the way. At 48o 10.80'N 122 o 59.70'W, off shore between <b>Dungeness Spit and Port Angeles</b>, we spotted our first blow. It was the <b>Southern Resident killer whales</b>. The Orcas were spread out all around us. We watched as they milled around in groups of two to four individuals, diving and blowing, their dorsal fins cutting through the water. What a sight! After spending some time with the whales it was time to make the long journey back. But time did not stop us from viewing two bald eagles on Long Island, a group of Steller sea lions on whale rocks, and gulls and cormorants on Goose Island. We couldn't have asked for a better day!
