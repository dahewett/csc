<b>September 30, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
A <b>Humpback </b>was by <b>Eagle's Cove</b> to Elk Bay slowly heading North. The lone<b> Humpback Whale </b>only made it as far as Rock Bay, by Chatham Point (Johnstone Strait, BC).
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:56 PM </b>- Faint vocals getting stronger on <b>Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:45 </b>- Lots of <b>orcas </b>headed north from <b>False Bay</b>, superpod?
<br/>Melisa Pinnow
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:25 pm</b> - Echolocation at <b>Lime Kiln</b>! 
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/>*<br/>
Residents were at <b>Hein bank</b> this morning around <b>10am </b>moving back towards San Juan Island. I believe we saw members of K pod. This afternoon we had reports that they had made it north of Lime Kiln, but by the time we reached them around <b>2:15pm</b> they were back out off of<b> False Bay</b>. We also saw some Dall's in Haro near the residents, and there are more Steller's everyday at Whale Rocks. 
<br/>Mike, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
I drove (by car) to the San Juan Island Westside Land Preserve at about 5:45pm, no Orcas, so I headed south to see if they were still milling about. Pulling over at <b>False Bay</b>, I spotted a trailing <b>group of whales</b> heading northwest! So I went back to the <b>Hannah Heights</b> area at<b> 6:30pm</b>, delighted to see the <b>Killer Whales </b>all spread in small groups, out in Haro Strait traveling northwest. After awhile I noticed a female with 2 youngsters stopped, just logging-resting at the surface. Then the whales up north turned and swam back, rejoining the other groups. I wonder if that female was a matriarch deciding they were going back south, enjoying the slack water, utilizing the ebbing tide?! The sun had set, light fading, <b>7:30pm</b> now, yet I stayed until I couldn't hear their strong breaths anymore.

<b>6:12 PM - Orca at Lime Kiln</b>
<br/>Lon
<br/>*<br/>
On another gorgeous fall day - we found <b>many [orcas]</b> spread out over several miles, near <b>Hein Bank</b>. L88 was identifiable, but most too far distant to positively ID. They seemed to be heading towards SJI when we left, although we noticed several direction changes.
<br/>Jill Hein, Aboard Mystic Sea
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9 am - Calls on Lime Kiln right now</b>!
<br/>Judy Simons
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:39 am - Echolocation and calls at Lime Kiln.</b>
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/><br/>
<b>September 28, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Large group of Orcas passed by <b>Thieves Bay, Pender Island</b> between <b>5.45pm and 6.45pm</b>, heading north. Well spread out in groups of 2 to 5 included males and at least a couple of babies. Estimate <b>15 - 20 in total</b>. Some transited straight through, heading north towards Active Pass. Others stopped to fish in the kelp beds 100m off shore or less. Entertained with a couple of spy hops (including one of the babies) and numerous pectoral and tail slaps. A number came back later on in the dark - we could hear them but not see them. Not able to tell if they were returning from the north or stragglers catching up.
<br/>Ian Pirie
<br/>*<br/>
I headed to the <b>Lime Kiln lighthouse</b> just in time to watch the <b>orcas </b>as they headed north on a beautiful fall day. The orcas were less than 20 yards away from the shore, in the kelp beds below the lighthouse.
<br/>Jane Cogan  
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>2pm </b>we found members of our resident pods <b>K and L, almost 50 whales</b>, spread out in Haro Strait heading up to Turn Point. We were able to identify<b> K20, L87, L41, L88, and  K40</b>. We got to see a wide range of behaviors.
<br/>Mike, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
Beam Reach students were with resident orcas off <b>Hannah Heights</b>, southwest San Juan Island at <b>11:01 am</b> to northern Haro Strait between <b>Henry Island and Stuart Island </b>at <b>3:30 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:35 am:  Vocalizing on the OrcaSound hydrophone</b>.
<br/>Jane Cogan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:40 am - Orcasound and Lime Kiln hydrophones - Southern Residents</b> - Faint SRKW (S16/19) calls and whistles auto-detected this morning at Orcasound (7:30-7:35) and Lime Kiln (7:46), implying southbound direction of travel in Haro Strait.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
S. Peterson reported <b>four orcas</b>, one male and three others, at <b>12:50 pm </b>near April Point on <b>Quadra Island</b> in northern Georgia Strait, headed toward Seymour Narrows. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Here are some pics of the <b>T002C Gang with the new calf!</b> These were taken during our encounter starting at <b>1030hrs </b>and ending at approx <b>1300hrs</b>. They were travelling up Discovery Passage Northbound then went right thru Kanish Bay at the top of <b>Quadra Island</b> (north end of Georgia Strait). There may have been a seal kill near the end as there was some feeding activity and birds around after. The calf is the smallest I have seen for sure, looking more like a dolphin! They are my favorite gang of T's, love that T002c had the new calf.
<br/>Nick Templeman, Eagle Eye Adventures
<br/><i>Note: Many researchers are now using the term "Bigg's killer whales" instead of "transients" in honor of the late Mike Bigg, who pioneered field studies of orcas beginning in 1972.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>September 27, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>

<br/>*<br/>
After 2 days of howling wind and sporadic downpours it seemed as though mother nature decided to give us a break. It was a beautiful day. There was sun and there were whales. We even saw <b>a Minke</b> surface as we were watching Steller's Sea Lions at the south end of Cattle Pass. The <b>residents </b>were spread out on the south/ west side of the island. They looked to be moving a little bit offshore but were generally milling when we arrived. The first whale we encountered was <b>L21 </b>traveling (or hunting) with a female and juvenile male. There were whales everywhere but toward the end of the trip we ended up with a group that included K20.
<br/>Laura, Naturalist
<br/><i>Note: The Center for Whale Research was with K pod on September 28 and did not see a new calf.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:30 pm -</b> Beautiful, clear, echoing calls from K pod.
<br/>Meg McDonald 
<br/><b>5:30 pm -</b> oh, they are really starting to get chatty. Sounded like it was just one whale for a little bit now theres quite a few!
<br/>Rose Hite
<br/><b>6:04 PM Lime Kiln</b>
<br/><b>5:26 PM Orcasound</b>
<br/>Lon Brocklehurst

Beam Reach students were with resident <b>orcas </b>near <b>Hannah Heights</b>, southwest San Juan Island, beginning at <b>1:03 pm</b> to just off Open Bay, northwest San Juan Island, at <b>5:11 pm.</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>September 26, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Michael Rader called Orca Network to report a sighting of <b>3 orcas, at 1:20 pm </b>, about 4-5 miles offshore of<b> Punta Gorda CA</b> (just south of Eureka), heading south, including one adult male.
<br/>*<br/>

Orcas northbound past <b>Mitchell Bay</b> in rough seas. <b>4:50 pm:</b> Orcas southbound past <b>Mitchell Bay</b> in a pouring rain. Some calls on the <b>OrcaSound </b>hydrophone. Hard to make identifications, but I think I'm seeing Ls heading south. Not hearing obvious J or K calls on the hydrophone.
<br/>Jane Cogan

<br/><br/>
Here is a Breaching <b>Humpback </b>west of <b>Race Rocks</b>. We also encountered <b>T31 &amp; T49c</b> off Victoria as well as all <b>88 Resident Orcas </b>returning to the Salish Sea! It was the best trip of the season:)
<br/>Andrew Lees
<br/>*<br/>
Joe Carlson called Orca Network from <b>Victoria </b>to say that at<b> 3 pm</b> he saw <b>2 orcas</b> headed east about 100 meters from shore off Dallas Rd., Victoria. He said others had seen more.
<br/>*<br/>
Yup, <b>Js Ks and Ls</b>! Breaching, mating, relaxing .... AWESOME. Saturday at <b>5:59pm</b>
<br/>Tasli Shaw
<br/>*<br/>
Yeah, <b>residents, transients</b>, and even <b>a humpback or 2</b>, all in close proximity, wow!!
Saturday at <b>6:07pm</b>
<br/>Carrie Sapp
<br/>*<br/>
We were out on the water by <b>race rocks</b> with residents every direction, transients and <b>2 humpbacks</b>. Amazing day
<br/>Krista Larson Billinghurst 
<br/>*<br/>
Shanna Newell is reporting <b>Transients </b>off <b>Sooke</b>, BC, and <b>Js, Ks &amp; the L12s</b> in the <b>Victoria BC</b> vicinity as well!
<br/>*<br/>
My my what a day! Dense fog, heading West on a hunch, finding <b>Transient Orcas, Resident Orcas, and two Humpbacks</b>. I've never seen such fog, lasting all day long. I had heard from my buddies from Victoria that the skies were clear out West, and that if we got there we might be able to see a Humpback. So, after delaying our departure for an hour, and proceeding with great care through the pea soup fog, we headed for Victoria. Finally the fog lifted and out near Race Rocks we got our reward. First we saw two Transients, the mammal eating Orcas. Then we went to see two Humpbacks. Then we spent the rest of our time with the Super Pod, Js, Ks and Ls as they headed toward San Juan Island. And we were the only boat from the San Juans. An amazing day!

<b>September 23, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Around <b>2pm </b>we found <b>a single Minke north of Turn Point in Boundary Pass</b>. Dall's were out in the middle of Haro, but pretty elusive.
<br/>Mike, San Juan Safaris
<br/><br/>
<b>September 22, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>L Pod</b> was pretty much at <b>South Beach</b> when we first came upon them  They were spread out over a tremendous area. Once again the calm water made for easy identification of the saddle patch. Among the first whales we saw were <b>L2, L79, L72, and later L41 (Mega)</b>. We also had an amazing encounter with two juvenile whales who shot up, out of nowhere, in front of the boat, while we were shut down and proceeded to swim laps around us while we watched in amazement. The water was calm and clear and we could see the white flash from their bellies as they scooted in past us in a blur and then darted out to regroup before doing it again. In my whole summer out here I have not seen behavior like that from orca whales until today. Orcas may pop up near a boat and pass by at close proximity, but it is always with an air of dignity, as though they are on a mission and could care less about boat or the people on it. They always keep their composure and when they do let loose a little it is typically in the company of other orcas with boats watching from afar. Today was different. There was no breaching or rolling upside-down.  No tail slapping or lollygagging at the surface. These two little guys were behaving, totally and completely, like a couple of hooligans. It was awesome. Even Capt Mike had to leave the wheelhouse and squeeze up to the railing to get a better view. It was one of those exceptional moments that makes you want to do a fist pump and yell, "Yessss!"
<br/>Laura, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/>
Beam Reach students were with <b>[orcas] from 3:02 until 4:02, along the southwest side of San Juan Island</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>September 21, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Members of all the pods, J-K-L</b>, out in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, off of San Juan Island, between <b>3:10pm to 4:25pm</b>. We identified the big guy sighted first; L-41 Mega with sister L-77 Matia, heading toward Salmon Bank. They turned back and we noticed L-25 Ocean Sun. Well, 83 year old L-25 Ocean Sun jumped out of the water, she breached 2 times!! A magical moment... We see a group closer to shore porpoising, speed swimming, had they all decided to travel northwest? Then some L-Podders closer to shore, lunging, hoping they caught a Chinook Salmon! We are also listening to J-K-L vocalizations, with the lighting and wildlife an extraordinary encounter!

We just got back from a 5 day kayak trip in the <b>Southern Gulf Islands</b> today. I wanted to report an Orca sighting. On Wednesday morning the 21st we were paddling around Taylor Pt on Saturna Island when we spotted a couple distant Orcas to the east. After watching for about a minute, we proceeded on in and landed at the beach inside the point. We then climbed up the stone stairs and followed the path out to Taylor Point hoping to spot more whales. It was around 11AM. Once we got out into full view numerous Orcas were feeding in the vacinity of Java Islets. For the  next 15 minutes we watched what must have been a pod of about 20 whales feed...probably on salmon. They gradually moved in a westerly direction heading into Plumper Sound and out of sight. I would be curious which pod we might have seen?  
<br/>Jim Benson, Sequim
<br/>We had a report of<b> J pod</b> heading south in Haro Strait a little later that day, so that's probably who you saw.
<br/>*<br/>
We encountered <b>4 transients off Hein Bank around 12:30 pm</b>, one male and 3 females, heading south-east, perhaps another visit to Puget Sound? Then we headed north-west and were accosted by <b>Dall's porpoise</b>, then found the<b> L12's coming south along SJI, very spread out, with L41, L79, L89, L94 and L113</b> easy enough to identify. They were still heading south when we left them around 3:30 or so. The weather was picture perfect, mill-pond like seas and beautiful clouds.  Magic!
<br/>Jill
<br/>*<br/>
Beam Reach students were with <b>[orcas] at 1:50 pm in Haro Strait</b> north of Henry Island, and at <b>3:48 at Open Bay between Henry Island and San Juan Island</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
I went out with Island Adventures again today. We saw the<b> T30s west of Whidbey/south of Lopez</b> and then <b>L25 Ocean Sun, Skanna and Alexis off San Juan Island</b>. All of these photos are the T30s except the sideview spyhop, which is L25.
<br/>Cathy Scott
<br/>*<br/> 
We left the harbor today and headed north. Half way up the San Juan Channel we encountered  Dall's Porpoise. As we were leaving the Dall's we saw a large male ELEPHANT SEAL. The large, protruding nose was a dead giveaway. Out in Haro Strait we shut down and watched a small group composed of <b>J16, J26, and J42 and 36</b>. They looked to be just traveling. There were no long dives and their pace was slow and steady. We could hear each and every breath from whales near and far away from us. A single female surfaced off our other side and we watched her glide gracefully past us. There were so many whales in all directions that we dropped our hydrophone to take a listen. It was as if we had stepped into the middle of a crowded party. It was so calm that we could even hear echolocation clicks. While we were sitting, watching, and listening to the orcas something big exploded to the surface about a quarter of a mile away from us. It was like watching a submarine shooting to the surface. It happened two more times. In that time I was able to gather my wits and identify the large, torpedo-like object as<b> a breaching Minke Whale</b>!  I have never seen a Minke breach before. It was awesome!

Another wondrous, memorable trip out into the Salish Sea! Calm, clear waters, like a pond with a minimal ebbing tide. More sun and many, 50+? whales heading northwest from about <b>3:15pm to 4:30pm</b>, past Spieden and Stuart Islands. <b>J-Pod and L-Pod Orcas </b>spread out, some males further out in <b>Haro Strait</b>, while females with youngsters closer to shore. L-55 with the newest calf L-118 and the rest of her family were the trailing group, so they sped swam- 'porpoised' to catch up! All the groups gathered together as they had to decide which way to go at Turn Point. I guessed they were going to turn right, into Boundary Pass, and sure enough they did! L-Podders don't go the other way through Active Pass, as much as J-Podders do. They spread out again, heading toward Saturna Island, surfing the wake of a large cargo ship, and a parting breach. Breathtaking to see the whales and waters, island and mountain backgrounds.

Another sunny, beautiful September summer day, with a minimal ebbing tide and slack water, I think the whales enjoy it too! <b>J-Pod and L-Podders</b> spread out in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> from Salmon Bank to Middle Bank, all the way out to<b> Hein Bank</b>, a favored fish hunting region. From about <b>3:25pm until 4:30pm</b>, the Orcas were slowly milling about, making direction changes, chatting-vocalizing! Young, 16 year old J-30 Riptide and 21 year old L-84 Nyssa seemed to be goofing off, playing, and frisky, as they swam close together and we saw J-30 going on his back, flashing his 'pink floyd'! Maybe he was showing off, competing with L-84?!

We came across <b>L41 </b>swimming by himself near <b>Hein Bank around 2pm</b>.

It was late in the day, or at least felt like it. Everyone had left but one boat well to the south with a humpback. We shut down and did our <b>1700 </b>count. Jaeda noticed a female trailing the last group we had watched pass by. The group with young ones was very active. There were other whales to the north and south of us <b>all heading west</b>, except for moments of surface activity and fishing. Since we had seen L-92 pass along that line a mile or so ahead, we thought she was the most likely candidate. We moved in to check on her, and yes, it was <b>L-90 swimming alone steadily</b>.

Concerning my moms Wendy Pinnow post earlier, I talked to her and we have come to a conclusion that <b>the whale she saw with the orcas was indeed a humpback</b>, 15 foot long pecs with bumps on the edges and a small lump of a dorsal fin fits the description. She was concerned of odd behavior as it looked like it was behaving like it was stressed. When she last saw it, it was heading south <b>following the resident orcas</b>. Could it be Canuck struggling to still get free from the fishing gear? Did any of the whale watching boats see the humpback with the orcas today?

At<b> 6:20 pm</b> yesterday I encountered <b>7 transient killer whales - the CA51s</b> - about 3 miles off the <b>Los Angeles Harbor</b>. This matriline, including 2 small calves, is often VERY boat friendly. A sea lion was taking refuge under the whalewatching boat Christopher, and then switched to our boat, pressing against the hull. Several whales repeatedly spyhopped - especially the calves. They rested and rolled nearby, making long dives as the sea lion peered downward. When the sea lion drifted from our boat a few times, the killer whales immediately approached it. One juvenile breached on it and tail-slashed; the sea lion immediately returned to the safety of our boat. The transients ignored a fast-moving group of common dolphin that passed nearby. When we left them due to darkness, the killer whales and sea lion were still there.

Monday the residents headed back out to the Pacific, and sure enough transient families are noticed! We went to Canada, 
<b>south of Discovery Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, from about <b>3:55pm to 4:25pm</b>, although a 4' flooding tide, the water was smooth, the sun came out for a bit! Reports were of 33 year old <b>T100 and her 3 youngsters, 38 year old T101 with her 2 youngsters, and a 27 year old male T102</b>. We also saw a third group I think may have been <b>44 year old T30</b> with her 3 offspring, as that male looked like her son, 25 year old T30A. Nice to see the youngsters from 5 to 14 years old, and the mature transients, all 12 killer whales, traveling close together. Unusually, one whale kept coming up sideways, showing its belly! No porpoise or seals out there- maybe they got the word! Back towards Salmon Bank and San Juan Channel appeared Dall's Porpoise, Harbor Porpoise and Seals, and Steller Sea Lions.

Over the years I have noticed something about the Orcas, porpoise, migrating marine birds, Steller Sea Lions, Harbor Seals and pups, all the life of the Salish Sea, that September is special. We see more gatherings of the pods, more active above surface behaviors, in some of the warmest, nicest conditions. Are the whales well fed from the spring and summer salmon? Are they planning their expanded travels to find enough salmon to sustain them in the fall and winter? Are they socializing, saying their goodbyes, like we are to them? Off of<b> Hein Bank</b> in a fairly strong 7' flooding tide at about <b>4:00pm to 4:30pm</b>, we were awed by <b>J-Pod, K-Pod, and some L-Pod</b> families energetically spyhopping, breaching, cartwheeling, headstands-tail flukes held in the air!, tail fluke lobbing and slapping the water, pectoral fin slaps on the surface, and some whales moving upside down on their backs!! Wonderful to see <b>J-2</b>, 100 year old Granny just as active, and hear their chatter on the hydrophone. The kitten like K vocalizations are distinct and J's S-1 call! We saw salmon jumping out of the water on our way back in, so hope the whales found the kings- Chinook Salmon, and are feasting well!

I'm very curious to know who the baby I saw is. Such a little cutey. It was a wonderful day to be out on the water - watching the whales from a safe distance. It was nice to see soundwatch there keeping an eye on the boats who weren't as respectful of the whales space. I've done whale watches in the past that really felt more like chasing the whales. I really enjoyed that we just stopped, shut down and watched and listened to the whales.

L pod in all of its glory. Our whale encounter began with <b>Mega</b>. We were just south of eagle point with no other whale watching boats in sight and out of no where a huge dorsal fin came to the surface. We stopped and waited to see where he was headed. He was moving south toward us so we shut down and waited. It was glassy flat, calm and quiet until his exhalation cut the silence like a jet engine. He meandered in our direction and then slowly swooped around and took a 90 degree turn out away from us. He milled back and forth for a while until he was several hundred yards away from us. We started up again and continued north. Up toward the north end of <b>San Juan</b> we encountered the rest of the pod. They were very spread out. They looked to be fishing. There was some surface activity here and there but with long dive times. We got a few looks at a couple of females and juveniles and one other large male.

The whales were about 1.5 miles south of <b>False Bay</b>, basically making a giant circle as they milled about. There were two distinct groups, and <b>Js and Ks</b> were interspersed between the groups. We saw J28 Polaris and her calf J46 Star swimming alongside J30 Riptide  J22 and her clan, J34 Doublestuff and J38 Cookie were also in this same group. The other group had <b>L87 </b>Onyx (honorary J Pod member) hanging out with <b>K21, K25</b> and lots of K females. We also saw <b>J26 Mike and J27</b> Blackberry swimming about. The whale groups would coalesce and separate and then come back together again. The water was flat calm, so you could hear the blows from a long distance away.  We saw 3-4 spyhops, but what was intriguing was the whales would make almost choreographed turns but we never heard them make a call, so we wondered what the non-verbal signal (or out of range of our hydrophone?) they were using. The whales pretty much held this pattern for about an hour before deciding to head towards shore. Since we limit our time with whales to no more than 1/3 of our trip time (so about an hour and 10 minutes max), it was perfect timing for us to head back. There were also reports of the T30s about 4-5 miles further south of the SRKWs but we didn't have time to head over to see them this trip.  Lots of Stellar Sea Lions on Whale Rocks now as would be expected (more than 20), and they were fun to watch as they growled and snarled at one Stellar who had had enough swimming and was ready for some sun bathing.

<b>12.45AM </b>- I heard some large splashes flukes and fins last night at approximately <b>12.45AM from the south end of Marrowstone</b> - approximately mid channel west across from Whidbey. Thought it was probably whales - and then just saw this email :)

Shannon McGraw called today to report that he was fishing <b>35 miles out from Depoe Bay OR</b> and saw <b>three orcas</b>. A male at least as big as their 22' boat approached and passed by them in the fog. They also saw an apparently injured dolphin struggling to swim about the same time.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>About 4PM or so, out of Victoria</b> MV Coho crossing to Port Angeles was slowed and stopped midway in the Strait of Juan de Fuca by <b>a lone humpback slapping its tail</b> for many minutes, breaching and flopping down onto its side. Long elegant flippers waving, tale slowly splashing. An incredible treat.

<b>Southern residents (members of all three pods) off Saturna at 1.00 pm</b>. Porpoising, spy-hopping, breaching, full of life on a truly glorious day. Thanks, Soundwatch and Straitwatch, for being out there to help draw attention to the regulations and protect the whales

We ended up in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, just south of the city of Vancouver, with orcas spanning over a quarter of a mile lined up in smaller groups and heading north. As we paralleled them for a while, we were able to identify <b>J-27, "Blackberry</b>," as one of the more recently-matured whales of the community. He had a juvenile--possibly his little brother "Mako"--and two females and/or larger juveniles. The orcas engaged in just about every surface behavior they have in their repertoire, from tail slapping to spy hopping to even breaching, it was all there! Welcome back, resident orcas!

Lots of <b>orcas </b>northbound along the west side of <b>San Juan Island </b>earlier this morning. Some foraging. Some porpoising. And some very playful little ones.

<br/>
<b>4:50 pm</b> - the <b>orcas </b>are nearing <b>Marrowstone Pt</b>, still heading north.
<br/>
<b>4:30 pm</b> - porpoising, lunging, breaching, tail lobs - some hunting going on! too far off for IDs, hoping some of our photos will turn out.
<br/>
<b>4:25 pm</b> - 6 - 8 orcas now heading NORTH in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>.
<br/>

<b>Four to five orcas</b>, one a juvenile, were seen cruising around the rocky outcrops near <b>Iceberg Point off Lopez</b>. They were of the transient community with solid saddle patches and wide dorsal fins that angled further toward their posterior than the residents. We left them as they slowly started making their way north. On our way back, we noticed that Whale Rocks were crowded with gigantic Steller sea lions and encircled by a few harbor seals. This happened to be not far, and in the same direction the transients were moving towards. We wondered if a pinnipede smorgasbord was in the making.

Nancy Black of<b> Monterey Bay</b> Whalewatch (MBWW) reports that she saw <b>9 transient killer whales this afternoon</b>. MBWW got on them at about <b>3:30 pm</b>, along the south edge of Monterey Canyon. These were the <b>CA51s and the CA50s</b>, including two young calves that played together. They were breaching, spyhopping, lobtailing, rolling around and partying. Yesterday marks the 20th anniversary of the first identification of CA51 in Monterey Bay!

We had heard about <b>a minke beyond Cattle Pass</b> and so we went to investigate. After five minutes of searching--with the distraction of sea lions nearby for any short attention spans--the Captain of the Sea Lion spotted the tell-tale curved Minke whale dorsal fin. And another two minutes after that, passengers noticed it too! It appeared a little on the small side--a juvenile perhaps?--and continued swimming in what looked like foraging maneuvers.
