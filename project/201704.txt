<b>1:00 a.m. - Saanich - 5-7 orcas in Patricia Bay</b> (west side of Saanich Peninsula, north of Victoria BC) early this afternoon. Appeared to be hunting/feeding. Also noticed heads fully out of water and tail slapping. Whole group approached boat. -Bradley Fisher
<br/>(<i>Looks like the <b>T46Bs</b>. - Melisa Pinnow, CWR</i>)

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Incoming Admiralty to Puget Sound</b> - First saw orcas come into <b>Elliot bay around 7:45</b>. Started with a miles away teeny spyhop.  The group was coming SE at a normal pace, then did some showy business and started milling. They got to a point that is "go time" for me to get back behind lighthouse. As we approached the car I saw <b>two very close to shore on the Alki side</b>. So, naturally I got distracted and went to look. Then I had a feeling that those two were going down and sneaking over to lighthouse. That, is exactly what they did. We raced backed over there, just as the giant bulls surfaced. I missed the shot. I am quite sure someone got one. There were many folks out there. There were at least a dozen seals and sealions. It was as still as night and eerily quiet. As the bulls porpoised at a painfully slow rate we all thought we were going to see a horror show. They were liquid in their movements....no sound. It was almost dark, the sun was setting. None of the seals or lions moved or seemed to care. The sealions were even thermoregulating. It was bizarre. But they clan moved on, into the sunset and darkness. -Kersti Muul

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:50 p.m. - Looks like they may be heading past Alki</b>. Looks to be spread out. 2+ near eastern side of channel and 3+ on western side of channel heading south. -Melissa Mitchell

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:30 p.m. -</b> They were slowly heading south/ west mid channel. They <b>crossed the ferry channel &amp; Bainbridge ferry </b>probably got a nice view. I also saw a couple harbor porpoise near Magnolia shore. -Suzanna Joor

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:00 p.m. - pod of 5+ Incl. adult male now out from Shilshole </b>probably. I think I saw another male approx a mile ahead and further west. All southbound. I need to leave, good luck.
<br/><b>6:44 p.m. - just pulled up to Carkeek they are south of me approaching Golden Gardens </b>next. Steady pace east of mid channel, loosely grouped. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:40 p.m. - watching from Sunset Hill</b> park, mid channel still heading south, <b>passing Shilshole Bay Marina</b>. -Danielle Carter

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:00 p.m. - mid channel off Jefferson Head</b>. Seem to be milling, potentially feeding. Lots of splashing and a full breach.
<br/><b>5:48 p.m. - Currently off President Point</b>. -Mikail Kiva

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:57 p.m. - See fins and water spray...south of Kingston ferry</b>. -Ryan Sheridan

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

They were in the middle of the navigation lanes at <b>5:15 pm, so west of mid-channel. ~3 miles due west of Edmonds at 5:15 pm</b>. -Sherman Page

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:26 p.m. - mid-channel</b>. At the ferry lane now. They are a bit spread out.
<br/><b>5:10 p.m. - Still southbound, approaching the Kingston/Edmonds ferry lane</b>. Steady progress. 6-8 plus a large male in the rear.
<br/><b>4:55 p.m. -  See them still heading south. Line of sight is Apple Tree Point</b> to southwest tip of Whidbey. I'm terrible at judging where they are in the channel but would say they are mid-channel. -Sarah Frey

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:20-4:45pm -</b> I spotted them from <b>Eglon</b>, hugging the Whidbey side and following a WW Boat. I saw <b>one Bull + 4-5 others</b> - they were so far I couldn't tell much else. Traveling south at medium speed, then long down times before I lost sight as they approached the tip of Whidbey, guessing they would continue south along Mukilteo/Edmonds shoreline. DIdn't have internet out there, sorry for late post! Here are the little orca specks. -Donna Green VanRenselaar

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:44 p.m. - spotted east off Point No Point</b> headed south. -Amy McCormick

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:40 p.m. -</b> Marilyn called from <b>Point No Point</b> to report seeing about four orcas in mid-channel, still heading south just north of the yellow buoy marker.

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3.15 p.m. - from Mutiny Sands. Whales still heading south</b> to yellow marker. -Sandra Pollard

<br/><b>2:25 p.m. -  TWO adult male orcas, about 4 miles N of Pt. No Point</b>, closer to Whidbey side heading south toward Point No Point. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:58 p.m. - South Puget Sound - They are headed west around south side of McNeil</b>, there were at least 5...3 adults and two younger ones (no males). -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:30 p.m. - </b>Found them, <b>south side of McNeil island</b> now, must've switched direction and hurried south. -Brian McGinn

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:15 a.m. - They're at Raft Island. 
<br/>9:47 a.m. - Orcas headed towards Purdy</b> right now.
<br/><b>8:00 a.m. - Orca sighting Henderson bay - Penrose State Park</b> - I watched a pod of <b>4-6 orcas swim off of Penrose Point</b> on the key peninsula near Gig Harbor. -Chas Walters

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Juan de Fuca - The Alaskan Unknowns was seen on April 30th at Race Rocks</b> by us SpringTide whale watching and some other boats. They traveled with the <b>T068, T068A (both confirmed with pictures) and possible T068C's.</b> Possible that they left the Salish Sea because they traveled west. -Marcus Bergstrom, April 30, 3017 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

April 30 - Observed from <b>12:45 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.</b> - I went out to check on <b>a reported humpback in North Bay in upper Case Inlet, turns out there were two</b>. Down times were long and travel irregular so I didn't know there were 2 for over an hour until they surfaced at the same time several hundred yards apart.  Also for about the  first hour I wasn't hearing or seeing robust exhalations nor any flukes,  so was getting a bit concerned. I was seeing lunges (no pecs visible), but was difficult at first due to distance to confirm lunge feeding which is what it turned out they were doing. Eventually I was hearing and seeing robust blows and travel seemed fairly normal so my concern diminished.
<br/>The whales traveled <b>back and forth between Rocky Point and south of Victor (to the east side) &amp; Allyn (to the west)</b>, but spent most time somewhere in the middle , at times very close to shore on the east side, traveling and lunge feeding. Once I moved closer and had a better view I was seeing what appeared to be <b>rather huge schools of forage fish</b> (later confirmed by locals). Some gulls swooping but not too many up there (nothing at all like typical bait ball scenerio) Beautiful whales. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Noon</b> - Unmistakable<b> humpback whale in Case inlet near Allyn WA</b>. Feeding. -Peter Benda, April 30, 2017

<b>10:35 am - Humpback is back in Case Inlet</b>, North Bay,  moving across the Inlet back and forth and down long periods. -Beverly Lynch McCallum

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:16 -</b> seeing blows and now angling towards north. Still mid channel between Whidbey and Hat.
<br/><b>9:05 a.m. -</b> just saw whale surface and fluke about halfway between Cl<b>inton Beach and southeast end of Hat Island</b>. Looks to be heading towards Hat. No definitive ID but presume gray. Will keep looking that direction - saw from living room! -Debbie Stewart

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>Unidentified killer whales - Neah Bay - Called this morning from Hobuck beach, Neah Bay at 9:30 am</b>, woke up looking at the surf and what looked to be <b>a large male orca with a smaller orca heading north east about 600 yards off shore</b>. Too far to see any saddle patches or identification of any sort. They were moving pretty fast and passed through the bay in about 7 min. First time see this beautiful creature in the wild! -Audrey Long

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

It was our day to see the orcas! We got up early, had breakfast then drove to the beach. After checking the e-mail, map and reports my husband looks at me to say: "We may be here awhile. Hey, maybe we should go to<b> Chambers Bay</b>, have faith, Desiree!"  He was completely right. When we got to the park our son just fell asleep, so the dog and I went to have a look. I saw lots of Harbor porpoise but no orcas.  After a long nap the boys found me and I kid you not, not even 10 mins later we saw six orcas with one beautiful baby! Now thats good timing! -Desiree Sauve

Today was really something. I watched Orca's swim in the <b>Burley Lagoon, then swim under the Purdy Bridge back out into Henderson Bay</b>. I grew up out there, playing on these shores, so seeing Orca's here is a check off my bucket list. ...Purdy Bridge!!! Traffic was stopped, both directions, as everyone was watching the Orcas. My zoom lens was too much, they were so close... <b>T68A</b>, the male in todays group. -Melissa Burke

<b>9:30 a.m - </b>Fantastic group of<b> 5 sighted in Purdy Sandspit/Henderson Bay</b> this morning. Lots of traffic stopped all along the sandspit with people taking pictures, so pictures and video should be available, (I did not get any). Very unusual to see them <b>so far south and up into Henderson Bay at the sandspi</b>t - very shallow water and it was mid-tide when this occurred, so no depth to dive in. They went under bridge to north side, circled around the shallow clam beds...<b>1 large adult, 4 small (possibly 1 female and several young?</b>) -Timothy Jackson

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:20 a.m. - Orcas in Henderson Bay - Burley Lagoon </b>- Four orcas (including adult male) came up <b>Henderson bay</b>, went under the Purdy bridge and into the burley Lagoon. They spend 5 - 7 minutes in the lagoon and then turned around and went back into Henderson Bay and started heading back south. Most likely feeding, there were a lot of fishermen fishing from the beach and there were other fish jumping in the area. -David Riel 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:00 a.m. - They are in Henderson bay</b> now. Headed into Henderson bay <b>toward Purdy Bridge</b>. 2 groups about 3 minutes apart. 4 or 5 in each group. Could hear spouts and they were moving at pretty good pace. They will have to turn around soon as were midway in the Bay. -Tracy Dodge Hamilton

<b>0800. Orcas in Carr Inlet </b>- Sighted pod with one adult male, at least one cow and calf, and other adults. Looked like at least 6 total. They were <b>headed north towards Purdy in 60'-100' of water</b>. Hope they were hunting seals! Traveling with some play. Dead end so they will be back through. -Ben Flesher

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:30 a.m. - 4-6 Orcas (including an adult male) 100 feet off shore of Maple Hollow Park on Key Peninsula</b>. Water was like glass, high slack tide, bright sun rising over the Cascades with a strange rainbow "ball" reflecting on the water trail the whales left. Drinking coffee and listening to them breathing, what a morning in the PNW! They were traveling from mouth of Minter Creek and Henderson bay south towards Lakebay. -John Campbell

Gray whales - April 29 - 1<b>2:43 p.m. - There are another 2 grey whales near the tip of Camano island</b> as well.

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Minke whales - April 29 - Admiralty Inlet - <b>11:42 a.m. - Solo whale very near shore off Lagoon Point</b>. I believe it is a <b>Minke</b>. Possibly travelling south, but unsure. Similar in size to an Orca. Smooth skin with no bumps on ridge of back. Curved dorsal fin, somewhat similar in shape to that of a female Orca but much smaller. Quite familiar with Gray, Humpback and Orca - definitely not any of those. Too small to be a fin whale, but similar dorsal fin. -Margaret Marshal

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:15 p.m. - Humpback in Case Inlet (North Bay) just South of Allyn</b>...Was milling about half mile South of Allyn. Notes: ...both later Friday and Saturday afternoon and evenings with incoming tide and stayed for several hours. He would arc his back tightly and appear to dive, then would breach mouth open and other times breach and roll. Other times barely break the surface and glide smoothly back down. He appeared to be feeding. We never saw tail slaps or fins. Case Inlet is pretty shallow with a bit deeper channel in the middle. From our house across is about 3/4's of a mile so he is a goodly distance from shore. -Beverly Lynch McCallum

Posted <b>3:45 p.m. -</b> Was out with them on my kayak for atleast 2 hours , they stayed <b>in Oakland harbor</b> pretty much the whole time until they turned east towards Walker park and we thought they were leaving but they suddenly turned around and went back to Oakland bay and are there right now . Lots of splashing , spy hops , tail slaps , pectoral slaps , breaches etc. -Amy Schierhoff

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

This same pod stayed in the west end of <b>Hammersley </b>all day. I watched all day except for about 3 hours so... But it looks like they may be fishing against the tide. (??) They swim quickly with the tide, without much action other than surfacing to breath, and then often hung out at one end of my view (with binoculars) Sometimes playing, splashing, breeching, swimming on their backs, tails in the air, and then they'd swim slowly back in the opposite directions, against the tide. The tide is extremely fast/strong in Hammersley but I don't think that was the full reason they were swimming slowly back against it. (I am on, and nearby, the Walker Park side, and can see from Shelton marina to the end of E Rose Valley Rd on the opposite side.) -Becky Wilson

April 27 - Mystic Sea left port this morning in search of <b>Gray Whales and found them, 6 of them </b>in fact! We cruised towards <b>Gedney Island</b> and when we reached the southeast side, we came upon our gray whale friends as they displayed various behaviors. Four of the six gray whales were identified by crew as numbers<b> 21 (Shackleton), 49 (Patch), 383, and 723 (Lucyfer)</b>.
The sky was mostly sunny and blue as we looked on at these majestic creatures. Four of the whales were feeding in the shallows while the other two swam and tail fluked out a bit further. Those on board got some nice looks at flukes of Patch and 383, rolls from each whale, and even a few heart-shaped blows....- Amy W., Mystic Sea

OMG - it was incredible. They were fishing the inlet hard, and have been for the past couple of days but today in particular. At one point they separated into two groups...and we look down and just a few feet from shore are two, sliding along just under the surface...couldn't be more than 8' deep and I'm guessing maybe 6'. They were swimming on their sides - we could see their white bodies - adolescent size. (Reminded me of Rubbing Rock) They circled around and must have joined the Shelton group and 3 large whales joined together and powered back towards <b>Shelton</b> (all this in front of<b> Walker Park</b> area). The 3 came up 3 times that we saw - altogether. Where they come so fast and hard that their heads and top portion of their bodies were out of the water - I'm guessing to get even more momentum. It took them 3 of these pushes to make it from around Chruch Point (tough to tell distance away) all the way to the opposite end in between Eagle and Munson Points near Shelton. At one point they "frolicked" jumping and turning and flipping, and just playing (along the same path that they had just hunted that I mentioned above)...went towards Shelton for a bit...and now I think they've headed out of the inlet. Like I said...they fished it hard!!  It looks to me as if there is the large male, a couple of larger females, 3-4 adolescence, and 2 babies. I could see the two babies playing together a lot yesterday. -Becky Wilson

We left the <b>T36A's, T99's and T49As just off the Patos light milling, socializing and vocalizing non stop at 6:30pm</b>. It was epic! The 36's and 99's had been there for a couple hours before the 49A's joined. And the party continued probably long after we left... -Barbara Howitt

<b>9:00 a.m. -</b> WS Ferries reports <b>4 orcas off the Orcas Island ferry dock heading west</b>. 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:30 a.m. - They are 4-5 orcas passing by right now through Harney Channel</b>. One large male, one juvenile male and 2 females and one young one. A large yacht plowed right through the pod seemingly without ever seeing them or slowing down. They seemed to come back up through the boats wake just fine, I think. Possible transients? They seemed busy milling around for a few minutes before disappearing  (this group was westbound). -Cheers, Mariann Carrasco

<b>Unidentified Orca sighting - Western Juan de Fuca- Bullman Beach/south of Neah Bay @ 4:30 - 4:45 P.M.</b> I spotted a pod (At least five; one male) about 400 yards off of Bullman Beach. Fishing boats had been fishing in the area earlier in the day. There is a reef and drop off about 300 yards off of the beach and these were just beyond it; this was also the area the fishing boats had been working in the morning. First became aware of them when one jumped, clearing the water, landing on his back/side. The rest of the pod were in the area and they held position for some time, ten minutes or so, before heading east, remaining within 1/2 mile of shore. I continued to watch them move slowly south, though they would stop at times, seemingly "working" an area before continuing east. -Scott Hartman

<b>10:00 a.m. -</b> Janet Bartlow called again from<b> Chito Beach </b>(Strait of Juan de Fuca, 50 miles NW of Port Angeles) to report <b>6 orca heading west</b>, splashing and tail lobbing, several miles out from shore. 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:30 a.m. - Discovery Bay/Eastern Juan de Fuca </b>- A small pod fed right off <b>Beckett Point, west of Port Townsend</b>. The most amazing thing I've ever seen. I cried. I am grateful! I have videos of it, little ones breaching all the way out! My best guess was around 5 or 8 whales. It was hard to tell and I was pretty excited. There was one male in the group with the larger dorsal fin. They came in to the point where I am working and left heading north back toward Protection Island. -Spencer Clanin, April 18, 2017

Approx. <b>8:30 pm (4/18) a humpback surfaced slightly to the south of me, heading S into Eld Inlet</b>. No photo. It surfaced 2 more times after long down times. <b>Last seen near Flap Jack Point.

It surfaced one more time heading north - toward Dana Passage. -Kim  Merman

How many whales today? We thought <b>we counted 7</b>, and have ID photos for 5 of them. What an amazing day - at one point 3 passed us swimming together! It seemed like whales were everywhere. So happy to see <b>#44 Dubknuck</b> back in town, and thrilled to see <b>#723 Lucyfer</b> has finally shown up (confirmed by us today) - making TEN of our local "Sounders" who've been seen in and around Saratoga Passage this year.

<b>12:55 p.m. -</b> Sweet News! Jill Hein aboard Mystic Sea confirms gray whale <b>#723 as the 10th North Puget Sound gray whale</b> inland this Spring! He is with <b>#44 and #56 off Hat/Gedney Island </b>and we are so happy! We have been wondering about 723... he was the first one confirmed inland last year 2016 but he didn't leave last May with the others. He had been seen many times through out the summer and fall around the San Juans and down in Puget Sound, but had not been seen this spring until today.

Once again <b>Patch (#49) and Little Patch (#53) </b>delighted passengers on both trips as the duo headed south from <b>Camano Head towards Hat Island</b>, their synchronized exhalations carrying on the breeze to give everyone on deck a whiff of pure whale breath! Barking California sea-lions rafting near Baby Island were a source of fascination as they glided by on the current, and their playful antics made the day for the kiddies on board. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Spotted this<b> whale at Cape Flattery this past Sunday at 1:05pm.</b> Is it a Gray? Looks like the fluke of a gray, but I'm a total novice so appreciate any help. While we were standing on the <b>western edge at Cape Flattery</b>, this one swam by right underneath us. As we were facing north, we only saw it for about 5 seconds before it submerged. We never saw it surface again. Unfortunately I only had time to raise my camera and snap one photo before it was gone. It never did completely break the surface....It was hugging the coast at CF and appeared to be heading into the Strait of Juan De Fuca. Thanks much for your response. We moved out here from Colorado a couple of years ago. Trying to learn all we can about these magnificent creatures. Always a delight when we see whales from land. And, to see this one so close to the shore was very special! -Russ Stamp

The close up photo of the whale's head is of male gray whale 21. I've noticed that these gray whales have a regular tendency of lifting their heads higher out of the water right after feeding in shallow water when they just begin to swim out of the shallows. The tail fluke photos are from female gray whale 22 on 4/14/17. She has beautiful patterns on her flukes! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

<b>5:30 p.m. - Two grey whales, traveling north off of McKees beach (Port Susan)</b>. Going slowly and feeding.  Doing some spy hopping, and staying about one hundred feet from shore. Took about 45 minutes before they rounded the point at Kayak and swam out of sight. Just beautiful. 
The blows were definitely two different sizes and when they came up the size of back before rolling down were significantly differently different.  One was more active than the other.  When they came up for a spy hop at the same time one seemed larger than the other. Just delighted to see them.  There was a quad copter drone over head.  Way to close, about 100 feet overhead.  And this is when they stopped eating to stick their heads out of the water.  I was wondering if the sound from the drone could have been disturbing them. -Nanci Bondelid Green

<b>Discovery Passage - Transient Killer Whale Predation Event: T023'S T011 T011A DALLS PORPOISE KILL</b>. The event took place on April 11th 2017 @ 50'4.054N 125'14.842W in <b>Discovery Passage by Steep Island</b> (near Campbell River). Still going through everything for positive identification but for sure had <b>T011 and T011A Wakana and Rainy</b> again. Loner male <b>T124c</b> had joined them, along with the <b>T023's</b> known as the Motley Crew by researchers on the West Coast of VI. This gang experienced 4 deaths in 7 years, but is bouncing back. Encounter started as most do. Whales were idling along at approx. 5 knots Northwest bound. within 10 min of being on scene the dinner bell rang. They had been spread out in a line formation and all of a sudden two females initiated the hunt with first a fast leap across the bow, then all of a sudden 40 seconds in a HUGE dolphin like jump to cut off the porpoise as it was making its way to my hull. Thats the one frame thats in the posted photos. One of the off contrast ones. <b>The hunt itself lasted approx. 25 minutes, with the food sharing portion taking up another 30 min.</b> Once they finished everyone was on their way northwest bound again. <b>Next morning April 12th there was a sighting of 10 plus Orcas Westing in front of Kelsey Bay @0730</b>. Of note during the encounter I did not see T124C T011 or T011A actually participate in the hunting action. They were on the outside with tail slaps and things it seemed. They were in the middle of some of the foraging after as far as i could tell. -Nick Templeman

Unidentified whales - <b>Juan de Fuca Strait - 10:00 a.m.</b> This morning, on a rising tide, we saw <b>two small whales </b>- (reported as: Minke, perhaps) within forty yards of shore, of of Bullman Beach, near Neah Bay. They both held their positions relative to the shore, they might have been feeding. The water isn't very deep where they were sighted. We really couldn't identify a color, per se, as most of the surfacings were quite quick, though no dorsal of any kind could be seen.  So, I'll be calling them immature Grays. 
(...my girlfriend and I manage The Bullman Beach Inn, and we are excited about the natural possibilities of the area. I posted another sighting - small whales again, Gray, with a pod of at least five Orca only about 200 yards from them.  Exciting viewing from our front lawn) -Scott Hartman

<b>Biggs killer whales (Transients)</b>
<br/>So after going through ID's and photos for a few hours this is what i have from the encounter... Looks like we had <b>20 animals in the afternoon including the 011's 036's 086A's 099's 123's and 124A's.</b> Makes more sense now with the amount of animals we were seeing during the encounters. Until I was able to see the pics on computer was I able to see the 124A's and others. I had 2 encounters, AM from 1100-1300 hrs and PM 1700-1900 hrs. During this time the orcas stayed in the area of the Willaby Shoals (near Campbell River) within 3 miles of GPS mark 50*1.230*N 125*13.161*W. They seemed to forage by bucking the currents both ways over a 10 hr period. There was much socialization, with all the juveniles frolicking together in the afternoon. -Nick Templeman

By the time we got on scene with them they were <b>south of Lime Kiln State Park (about 1:30pm)</b>. We first encountered <b>J26 </b>foraging by himself a ways off shore and stayed with him for a bit as he circled the area, going on long dives, looking for salmon. We next headed a inshore where we spent some time viewing J16 and two of her daughters, <b>J42 and J50</b>, who were traveling and foraging together. (We never encountered J16s eldest daughter J36 and J36's son J52 who off on their own foraging) <b>J16, J42, &amp; J50</b> were making many directional changes foraging while in general making their way south. We started to leave the scene when suddenly they got on a salmon and there was a burst of activity. It was really cool to watch the chase play out and heartwarming to see little J50 get spunky tail slapping and breaching on our way out. Also on this trip <b>we saw 2 humpbacks (one ID'd as Big Mama), a minke, Dall's porpoise </b>all within a couple of miles along the coast. Down at Whale Rocks we encounter <b>dozens of sea lions</b> (mostly Steller but some CA), Harbor seals, dozens of bald eagles, and many other sea birds. A gorgeous day. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

..."Orcinus" found <b>the J36s inshore right off Edwards Point at 1330. J36 and J52 </b>were foraging separately at first but then they moved a small ways offshore and began chasing a fish together. They milled around for a few minutes before charging back inshore side by side toward Edwards Point and Dave ended the encounter there at 1338. -Dave Ellifrit, CWR

Not close enough to get a good photo with a phone but close enough to clearly see them coming out of the water for breathing!! They were definitely south of say Magnolia (if magnolia stuck that far out) hope that helps. <b>Swimming west toward Bainbridge or Bremerton</b>.

We spotted harbor porpoise to the north and acting on Captain Eric's hunch, headed that way and found<b> a HUMPBACK whale</b>, what an amazing treat! He breached right in front of us (see video on Mystic Sea's facebook page). We had to head home, but were escorted part of the way by more gray whales. W.O.W.What a day! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>Haro Strait Off south end San Juan Island - </b>We are so well known for our Orca out here that sometimes its easy to overlook <b>the amazing humpback whales</b> that grace or sea.

With a blustery wind out of the north-west and whitecaps greeting us as Mystic Sea headed north in Saratoga Passage from Langley Marina, it wasn't long before we encountered <b>California gray whale #21 and, we believe, #22</b>. Tail flukes were not prominent on this occasion making identification more difficult in the choppy seas, but spy-hops (when the whale's head comes above the surface to look around) were! Time after time we watched as one or both whales checked out the surroundings, displaying an intense curiosity seen more often in the warmer waters of Baja where they are born. After leaving these two whales to continue on their way north, we encountered another of our returning Saratoga grays,<b> #53 (Little Patch)</b>, traveling in the same direction with purpose. Maybe all three whales eventually met up with the two gray whales reported earlier feeding near Oak Harbor, and that's where the party is today. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

<b>Howe Sound -</b> I was driving south on highway 99 from Squamish on Saturday, April 1st around <b>1:30pm </b>when we spotted <b>a pod of orcas swimming southward along the shore of Gambier Island</b>. It was a pod of several orcas and we watched them for about 15-20 minutes until they were out of sight. We observed their fins and breath spray, no breaching. They were clearly orcas as distinquished by their tall dorsal fin visible even from our vantage point across the water from them. It was a beautiful sighting! They appeared to be traveling south together as a pod. They were mainly just swimming as a group in the south direction near the eastern shore of Gambier Island. We watched them from across the water on highway 99, just north of Brunswick Beach.
Any adult Males seen?: I believe so. There were several with dorsal fins taller then the others. -Alissa Turtletaub

A beautiful day for whale watching! Nice smooth water, some sun, finally, and almost no wind. We quickly caught up with "Sounders" gray <b>whales #383 and 22</b>, just north of Langley. We followed these two 40+ ton beautiful giants south <b>toward Gedney Island</b>, watching them roll and dive together. We then turned north toward<b> Camano Head</b>, and found<b> #56</b>. On the afternoon trip, we spent more time with all three, even watching them sleep. They sleep with half their brain still awake, so they can surface and breathe, while they gently bob just under the surface. Captain Erik also found 4 bald eagles on the north side of Camano Island, and we caught glimpses of the elusive harbor porpoises. Another incredible day with lovely whales! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Around <b>4:00 p.m. - Saw a number of grey whales off of Cape Flattery</b>. It was hard to say they, seemed to be feeding around that island with the lighthouse. We could only see spouts. Everytime we they surfaced there were quite a few spouts, like 5 or 6 every surface. I don't know how many whales that equates to though. -Nathan Michael
