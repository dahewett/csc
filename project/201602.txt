29 February update - As of our last update <strong>on 25 February L95 and some of L pod were just north of the Columbia River heading north. When we relocated them on Friday morning they were north of the Columbia River heading </strong>south. The whales were very spread out and visibility was low due to fog and drizzle, making keeping track of then challenging as they were not vocalizing. In the early afternoon they started calling again and <strong>we heard K pod calls and observed some K pod whales in the area with L pod</strong>. We continued to monitor the whales into the evening acoustically. However, <strong>Friday morning was the last transmission we received from L95s tag such that when the whales stopped vocalizing early on the morning of the 26th we lost track of them</strong>. When we saw L95 the day before we did not detect a tag attachment issue and he was resighted on the 27th. <strong>We were able to relocate Ks and Ls on the 27th</strong>, again <strong>just north of the Columbia River</strong> and stayed with them well into the night until they stopped vocalizing <strong>near Tillamook Head</strong>. Seas were rough that day so we could not conduct small boat work but we could observe them from the Shimada and besides <strong>documenting the presence of all 3 of the L pod calves born this past year</strong> we also witnessed another episode of multiple breaches by numerous whales over a period of about 30 minutes, very similar to a bout of breaching we observed on the 2015 cruise. High winds and seas curtailed our efforts to conduct a broad search for K and L pods on the 28th, and with the extended forecast calling for continued high swell and winds we headed north and as of the 29th we are near the entrance ot the Strait of Juan de Fuca searching for J pod. -courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

The Island Explorer 4 has spotted her first <b>gray whale</b> of the season just<b> off Camano Head</b>! We left scene at around 1PM with the whale headed in the northbound direction. We do not have a positive ID on the animal, but we do know that it is not 723, Lucy! This means that there is more than one gray in the area! With the first trip departing Everett tomorrow, we hope to firm up an ID on this individual and find some more!

Center for Whale Research researchers Dave Ellifrit and Deborah Giles met up with <b>J pod in Haro Straite is their detailed report after finding all of J pod, including all the new J pod babies except the newest one, J55</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

On the previous update posted on the 24th <b>L95 and likely most of L pod were off the Quinault Canyon on the evening of the 23rd</b>, trending southeast. They continued south and we were with them most of the day o<b>n the 24th off the Grays Harbor area</b>. The whales were extremely spread out such that we lost contact with them for a couple of hours due to reduced visibility and no vocalizing. By the afternoon we relocated them and were able to stay with them all night.<b> This morning (the 25th) they were off the entrance to the Columbia River</b> and after traveling a few miles south, they turned north and were just north of the shipping channel entering the Columbia River by this evening. Weather conditions in the afternoon were spectacular and we were able to conduct small boat operations with the whales. L72 Racer and the NOAA vessel Bell M.

We were contacted this morning by Jeanne Hyde. She spoke those magical words you always want to hear, "<b>J pod, including J2 Granny, is here</b>. Now." We had a beautiful, sunny day with lots of whales. It feels like summer is just around the corner. -Maya's Legacy Whale Watch

<b>8:20 p.m.</b> - Sounds of whales - Sitting outside after dark at cottage near <b>Sheringham point (Juan de Fuca Strait)</b> lighthouse. We are hearing many whales passing by going east. Have been listening to them for half an hour but too dark to see anything. -Gwen Keith

Research teams from the NWFSC, Cascadia Research Collective, and Biowaves Inc departed on Sunday 21 February aboard the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada from Newport, Oregon. We transited north to the area where the most recent <b>signals from K33</b> had been obtained before <b>the tag stopped transmitting on 17 February</b> - between the Columbia River and Westport. After three sweeps through that area with no detections we headed up the Washington coast Monday night in the nearshore waters. As we neared <b>LaPush</b> this morning, with 25 knots of wind howling out of the east, we saw numerous small blows close to shore heading south. About an hour later we were able close on the whales and confirm that we were with <b>members of L pod</b>. The wind subsided about noon allowing us to launch our research boat from the Shimada. <b>About 1400 we were able to deploy a tag on adult male L95 </b>- (see attached photo). The whales have moved offshore this evening - near the head of the Quinault Canyon (see map). We are hoping for a tag attachment duration that allows us track L pod for the rest of the cruise to gain insights about not only their movements but also their behavior in their coastal winter range. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging.

<b>Whale in Port Angeles Harbor</b>: Large whale sighted close to downtown waterfront in Port Angeles Harbor, second hand siting, was told to me by a reliable source who observed whale. Much larger than orcas, not sure what kind. Whale surfaced briefly, and at least three people saw enough to know it was quite large. -Eric Neurath

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:23 p.m. - Small whale headed north toward Zittles Marina in south sound- JOHNSON Point</b>. We think maybe Minke? -- solo, moving slowly.  (Good chance it's a humpback that has been seen for several days around the Nisqually Reach area). -Robin Matthews 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">February 23</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:19 p.m. - </b>Small <b>pod of orcas (maybe 7 of them) off of Mukilteo Park</b>, just south of the ferries, mid channel heading south. -Holly C Cook

<b>3:45 p.m. -</b> long down times and now they've gone all stealthy on me.
<br/><b>3:30 p.m. - </b>do appear to be on a kill. Many directional changes in same general area 1-2 miles south of Possession Point maybe 2+ miles from north Edmonds
<br/><b>3:10 p.m. -</b> found them <b>south of Cultus Bay/Posession Point </b>east of the green buoy <b>off Scatchet Head</b>. Lunging and gull activity suggests a kill. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:20 p.m. - 6-8 orcas within 200 yards of Maxwelton Beach</b>, Whidbey Island, heading toward Possession Point. -Gary Stubbs

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:25 p.m. - </b>They are off <b>Useless Bay</b>, active, just north of green bouy channel marker. Susan counts at least 8 or 10. Maybe others have joined them. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:50 a.m. -  Mutiny Bay</b>, Whidbey Island. In the right place at the right time today (doesn't always happen that way). Five (at least) transient orca heading south in Admiralty Inlet at speed on this beautiful day, maybe a brief stop to feed.  - Sandra Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:50 a.m. -</b> Thanks to a call from Elsa Leavitt, Howard just found a pod of about <b>4 - 5 Bigg's/Transient orcas heading SE in Admiralty Inlet, just south of Bush Pt</b>. at 10:50 am! -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 am - Saw large whale off Manchester </b>coastline west of Blake Island. Large fin we suspect it is not an Orca, maybe gray whale. Blowing, slapping, breaching. -Melaine Coulter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:15 a.m. - </b>Spotted whale <b>between Manchester and Blake Island</b>... lots of breaches, playful slapping of water. Hard to identify what kind. -Rita McKendrick

...We were <b>5 miles south of Jordan River </b>when we finally spotted blows at <b>1615</b>. The first whales observed were <b>L72 and L105 west bound</b>. The rest were spread to the south and were doing long dives. <b>L118</b> with Jellyfish - <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. <b>L95, L103 and L123 </b>(born November 2015) west bound in the Juan de Fuca...See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 13. -Mark Malleson

On our previous update<b> on 16 February, K33 and likely the rest of K pod were off the Columbia River</b>, having just turned north. They traveled about half way up the the Long Beach Peninsula by that afternoon before turning south. On the <b>morning of the 17th they were off the Columbia River again</b>. Unfortunately, we received our last transmission about noon that day. We suspect that the tag detached as the battery levels were still good and this deployment of about 50 days was very similar to what we obtained for J27 last year. We are putting all the location data from K25, L84, and K33 to use as we attempt to locate the whales from the NOAA vessel Bell. M Shimada.

<b>1:25 p.m. - </b>A sighting of very small fluke of what looks to be whale at <b>Devils Head - South Sound (Anderson Island/Key Peninsula)</b> Looked like it was alone. We could not see it going toward Johnson Point, so guessing it went back toward north side of Anderson Island. Very eye catching activity of water disruption and then fluke - over and over. -Robin Matthews
<br/>(<i>unconfirmed species, but we've had several humpback sightings in the south Sound the past weeks</i>)

UPDATE -- we heard back that the <b>possibly entangled humpback</b> was traveling NORTH - so those of you onshore north of Edmonds &amp; in the Mukilteo/Clinton area please keep your eyes on the water for a whale trailing an orange buoy. (Humpback not seen again, see Intro summary for more details)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:38 a.m. -</b> Taking train <b>south from Edmonds</b>. Looks like a humpback close to shore dragging what looks like a crab pot bouy. Wednesday 2/17 10:30am. Can anyone assist? -Paula 'Skippy' Purcell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:35 a.m.  - Whale fouled in crab pot. Just offshore between Edmonds and Mukilteo</b>. Looks like it is caught up in crab pot gear with orange buoy. -Richard Purcell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Approx 2:00 p.m</b>. - Stu and I launched from Edmonds marina to search for the reported entangled humpback. We decided to check out the blows we had seen earlier off Scatchet Head to rule out that whale. We reached the spot of the last blow with no luck so headed northwest towards Useless Bay and could not find the whale. We doubled back and just as we were <b>off Cultus Bay about 2:50 p.m. I spotted a whale off Possession Point</b>. We slowly made our way over to confirm it was a gray whale. We watched it surface and fluke several times back and forth. <b>By 3:30 the gray was northbound just east of Possession . Pt. Buoy Whidbey</b>. This whale was not entangled and from video and Stu's photos confirmed this as one of the returning grays, #723. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:18 p.m. - </b> the whale blows I'm seeing are just west of the long row of waterfront homes on <b>South East Scatchet</b>.
<b>1:16 p.m. - </b> just spotted a blow just off of Scatchet Head Whidbey island. -Stu Davidson 
<br/><i>Gray whale #723 </i>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:45 a.m. -</b> Lynn Malecki called to report <b>either a gray whale or a humpback off Columbia Beach,</b> near the Clinton ferry dock on Whidbey Island, in mid-channel, heading south.

Southern Residents - 16 February update - As of the last update <b>on the morning of 9 February K33 and the rest of K pod were near La Push</b> on the outer Washington coast heading south. By the <b>evening of the 10th they were off the entrance to the Columbia River</b>, where they turned north. They gradually continued north reaching the <b>Quinault Canyon area off the Washington coast on the 13th</b>. Here they turned south again such that by the <b>morning of the 15th they were off Willipa Bay</b>. As of <b>this morning (16th) they were off the mouth of the Columbia River</b>. We are hopeful that K33's tag continues to remain attached into the near future as the NWFSC cruise on the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada to locate and follow the whales during their winter coastal movements is scheduled to get underway 20 February. -Courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

...Orca got on scene at <b>1142</b> about <b>a half mile southeast of Turn Island</b> mid-strait just a little closer to the SJI side than the Lopez Island side. The whales were the <b>T60's and T2B</b> again. <b>T2B, T60, and T60F</b> were actively engaged in the attack on a harbor seal who was trying to take refuge by a stray piece of kelp....The whales <b>exited Cattle Pass</b> and headed southeast in a loose group. Orca ended the encounter at 1452 about three quarters of mile east of the Salmon bank buoy. Read full CWR Encounter #11 report. -Dave Ellifrit , Center for Whale Research

Steady rain but at<b> 9:00 AM</b> news of <b>a pod of Orcas off of Eagle Pt.</b>, headed toward America's Camp. We had scheduled a 10:00 AM trip, rather than the usual 1:00 departure, thankfully. By 2:30 we had searched down to the southern tip of Lopez Island, with no luck. Figuring that we had either passed them, or that they had turned up San Juan Ch., we turned around. Twenty minutes later I spotted the <b>T60s near Whale Rocks, heading east</b>. They must have turned up the channel, into an ebb tide, and decided to go into the quiet waters off of South Lopez. Shortly after spotting them they made a kill, and we were so fortunate to be able to watch them as they fed off the kill. I would guess perhaps a couple of seals were on the menu. Here are a few images from the day. -Capt Jim Maya, Maya's Legacy Charters

<b>9:37 a.m. - Spouts off Marina Beach in Edmonds</b>. We think it's a <b>humpback</b>. Very exciting! It seemed to be headed north, but now from Sunset Ave we saw a whale seemingly headed south. -Tara Bergin

A friend suggested I let you know about a whale sighting I had from the <b>Edmonds pier in Edmonds, WA</b>, even though it's been a couple of weeks since I saw the whale. While I was bird-watching from the pier on Feb 15 during a steady rain, at <b>8:52am a Humpback Whale surfaced about 150-200 yards directly out from the pier</b>. It was facing north. It dove about a minute later and stayed down for 20 minutes. When it re-surfaced, it was facing south and still in the same general area. After another minute, it dove again, and when it came up again after 27 minutes, it was in the same area and facing north again. It soon <b>dove for the third time, at 9:43am</b>, and I did not see it again. I left the pier at 11am.  
Is it possible to identify this particular humpback from the pattern on its fluke? -Joe Sweeney, NE Seattle

Heard <b>multiple blows</b> this evening in <b>Yukon Harbor</b>.

<b>9 February update </b>- On our last update on 31 January, <b>K33 and likely the rest of K pod were off the entrance to the Columbia River.</b> Over the next five days they made several north--south excursions in the coastal waters <b>between Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor</b>. On the morning of 6 February they began a dedicated trip north and on <b>the morning of the 7th were in the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. The whales spent about a day in the central Strait of Juan de Fuca before heading back to the west. As of this morning <b>(9 February) they were near La Push </b>on the outer Washington coast. -Map courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

After receiving reports from Sandy Buckley and others of a small group of whales moving down the west side of San Juan Island in the morning, Dave, Giles, and Cindy met at Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 1020. Orca headed down to Salmon Bank and stopped to scan with binoculars. We turned off the engine and immediately heard a blow and soon <b>found the whales just a little southeast of the Salmon Bank buoy....and on the north end of Long Island (south end of Lopez Island). The T60's along with T2B</b> were feeding on something that they had killed prior to our arrival.... -Excerpted from Center for Whale Research Encounter no. 10.

Had to google it to ID it. <b>Fin whale spotted off Duwamish Head, Elliott Bay</b>, about <b>2:30 p.m</b>. Moving very slowly, gradually headed north. Someone in a row boat (!) was standing up taking pictures. Hope someone sent one to you. I saw a huge back, what I thought was a back. Rounded and gray. At first I thought it was a humpback, and that's what I was googling for today. What threw me was that 'in front' it had a sharp dark 'thing' stick out, so at first I thought it was a gigantic sea lion. Then I realized that I didn't know what it was, but it was large enough to be a whale, just one I hadn't seen before. When I saw the picture online of the fin whale in September that's when I knew what it was. I saw nothing else. Slowly moving north. -Robyn Fritz
