<b>July 31, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Just wanted to share....I had the incredible good fortune to be on a small tour boat <b>west of San Juan Island</b> with my childhood friend, Melody, when the resident <b>Orcas </b>had their gathering of the clans. <b>J, K, and L pods</b> were all coming in from north, south and east to form a superpod. 65 whales in all directions around us...It was a spectacular party time, with spy-hopping, tail-lobbing, cartwheels, breaching, blowing, porpoising, you name it, they displayed it. It was a joyful family reunion of the highest order.
<br/>"Granny," the matriarch of J pod is 100 years old, and there were two new calves. There are no words to describe the thrill of watching a ten ton beauty thrust out of the water, become airborn, twist and flip back into the water with a dramatic splash! We had front row seats to the most amazing demonstration of wild freedom imaginable. I am stunned and humbled and will never forget this truly awesome gift. Keep our waters clean, protect our salmon runs, (the survival of the Orcas depends upon the health of the salmon) and bring Lolita home (the last surviving Orca stolen from Penn Cove off Whidbey Island, living in a 35' tank at Seaquarium in Florida).

<br/>*<br/>
As we went around <b>Cattle Point</b> we spotted our first <b>killer whale</b>. Then, a little further ahead, there were many killer whales, at least ten of them, traveling close together. We were able to identify the new calf <b>(K-44) and Cappuccino</b>. We also believe there were some <b>J-pod</b> members in the mix. The juveniles were being particularly playful, spy hopping and tail slapping. One little guy also breached! In the midst of all the excitement, some salmon jumped out of the water in front of our boat. The whales then started heading close to shore, and right before they reached Lime Kiln they changed direction and headed back towards False Bay.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>K-Pod</b> whales that were sighted off <b>Pender </b>yesterday afternoon and near <b>Tsawwassen </b>early yesterday evening, passed by <b>East Point Saturna Island</b> this <b>morning </b>at <b>9:20am</b> headed back to <b>Haro Strait</b> -- about 15 orcas traveling west with an ebb tide. Traveling behavior for the most part -- a few breaches and some fluking in Boundary Pass. K13's came right to shore including <b>K13, K25, K27 &amp; K44</b>.

Just began hearing <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln</b> at about <b>3:15 pm</b>.

<br/><br/>
I saw what appears to be <b>4 Transient Orcas</b> off of <b>Gabriola Island</b>. The lone male appeared first and stayed for a little bit in one area. The other 3 joined later. They would come up and go down, staying near the surface in one area, possibly feeding. They then carried on to some rocky islands headed North. My guess is there were seals on the rocks. I even saw one lye on its back and tail lob. I looked through the transients. Is this possibly T030A? Does he have a bend to the left on his dorsal?
It was neat. Only too bad I was on shore! Binoculars were great!
<br/>Tim Green
<br/>*<br/>
A splendid whale day with not one but two sightings of <b>orcas </b>heading east through <b>Active Pass</b>. Around <b>3:30 pm</b> the first group, <b>K pod</b> I believe, went through on a very fast tide. They were accompanied by at least 10 boats so it was very busy in the Pass. Around <b>7:15 pm</b> and for about an hour, a second parade of <b>Js and Ls</b> came past our Orca Rock. Very spread out, in small groups, fishing as they went. Some tail lobs, a cartwheel, sideways swimming, a few breaches and spyhops. 
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:20 pm</b> - Arlene Solomon called from <b>Mayne Island</b> BC to say she was watching a <b>pod of orca</b>s entering <b>Active Pass</b> from the south.
<br/>*<br/> 
Candy Neville called Orca Network to report <b>a single orca</b> seen this morning at <b>9:30 am</b> from Hiway 1 south of <b>Yachats, OR</b>. It was about 50 yards from shore.
<br/><br/>
<b>July 29, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Little <b>K44</b> was having a good look around at <b>1.30 pm</b> with several spyhops as he frolicked in choppy water off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Members of all three pods were present with a couple of small, tight groups (including K44) exhibiting a gradual change to more tactile and high velocity behavior, breaching, cartwheeling and lobtailing, after a fairly stately procession.
<br/>Sandra Pollard, SSAMN
<br/>*<br/>
We found [<b>orcas</b>] right around <b>false bay</b> and they were milling, hunting, and doing other things that whales like to do. It looked like <b>K's and a few J's</b> here and there. Blackberry was making amorous advances toward one of the K ladies, who had a little one with her. Salmon were jumping, whales were pec slapping. The wildlife was all around rowdy. 
<br/>Laura, naturalist, san juan safaris
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orca </b>sighting off coast of <b>san juan county park</b>! OMG! The orcas came to visit again last night, right in front of the county park! This time at <b>3:00am</b>! And maybe with a baby!  Lots of vocalization and fin slapping! Can't believe how lucky we were to see them two nights in a row!

The black dorsals of <b>J and K pod</b> broke the chop of <b>Haro Strait</b> as we made our way towards Victoria. We then allowed the strong current that had worked against us to now be in our favor as it pushed us towards the west coast of San Juan Island, drifting beside the orcas. We saw Deadhead (K-27), who was named after the singer of the Grateful Dead who passed the year of her birth, and her three-week-old son. The passengers (and the naturalists) gasped as she unexpectedly spyhopped to check out her terrestrial surroundings.

OMG!  We were awoken at <b>1:00am</b> this morning to the sound of flapping fins! We jumped out of our tent and ran to the bluffs at the county park, and could not believe our eyes! Right down in front of us, not 50 feet away, were 3-5  orcas slapping the water, making a wonderful racket! All of the sudden, they stopped slapping and started vocalizing, and I swear they sounded almost human! They were rolling around in the water. We stayed and watched until 3:15! And when we turned around to walk back to out campsite, one of the orcas jumped up and made a loud splash! We missed the jump, but we saw the splash! It was totally amazing!

We left for our <b>2pm trip</b> with news that a group of <b>transients had been spotted in the morning on the South side of Active Pass</b>. By the time we reached them they were cruising up the east shore of Valdes Island, spread out in a search for seals! We got there just in time to witness 2 kills of Harbor seals and some celebratory activity. In total we witnessed at least 3 kills, 4 spyhops and 4 breaches. We later identified the 4 whales as <b>T101, T101A, T101B and T102</b>, which we were excited to discover, as the last time these whale were in the area was for their famous visit to Stanley Park. Great to see the transients again and a beautiful summer day on the water!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30</b> - I'm on <b>Protection Island</b> (west of Port Townsend) doing some volunteer work with NOAA and WDFW, and <b>5 transients</b> just showed up on the west side of the island to charge the harbor seals hauled out on the beach. They hung out for 15-20 minutes, lobtailed a bit, then took off south. I think there may have been a little guy with them, couldn't quite tell for sure.
<br/><b>4:45</b> - They're back, and there's definitely a baby. Looks like they just chomped a harbor seal, lots of seabirds circling.
<br/>Reilly Hannigan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4 pm</b>  - We just watched <b>6 Orca</b> hunting harbor seals on Kanem &amp; Violet points (<b>Protection Is</b>). There were 3 lunges for shore and one seal corralled by at least 5 Orca! The group had one large male and two small Orca of about 1/3rd of the size of the large male. They were heading east when last seen.

Today was an awesome <b>afternoon </b>on the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. The whales were visible from Lime Kiln Point State Park from <b>12:30-6:00 PM</b>. <b>J- and K-Pods</b> started by coming slowly south, very spread out, against the flood tide. Then they all went north with the L12s, before turning and coming back south again. At times whales were right off the kelp, and other times they were well out in the middle of Haro Strait. Throughout the afternoon we saw a wide range of behaviors including tail slaps, breaches, spyhops, porpoising, and logging. The last group that went south around 5:45 PM was a big one, and included males J30, J34, J27, and L41 who were all rolling around together with several "sea snakes" visible. Between whales I saw and/or photographed, I identified members of every matriline in J- and K-Pods plus the L12s, so there were probably about 60 whales out there. It sure looked like they were having a good time out there, and all of us on shore were as well.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J's and K's</b> visited <b>Saturna's East Point</b> from <b>7:45 am until about 8:45</b> riding the tail end of an ebb tide, heading towards Haro Strait. Extremely active and playful non-stop for as long as I could see them -- multiple double and triple breaches observed, and just about every other acrobatic maneuver -- cartwheels, headstands, you name it. In the range of about 30+ whales, led by J2 -- almost all visiting the kelp beds at the lighthouse passing as close to shore as possible. I can't say that there was too much obvious foraging, but J2 and two others, well ahead of the rest, doubled back after coming around Boiling Reef and headed into the channel that runs in the middle of the reef where the current is strongest, and seem to busy themselves there for three or four minutes before continuing on their way. I continued to watch them until around 9:30 when they disappeared behind Monarch Head. Not a single boat of any kind the whole time that I can recall.
<br/>-Miles Ritter, Saturna Island
<br/>*<br/>
Around the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, we started to see the tell-tale dorsal fins of the <b>orca whales</b>! We saw a cow-calf pair, two females and then a lone male traveling south along the island. Eventually, we saw three females/juveniles playing pass-the-bull-kelp! One animal had the kelp crossed over its dorsal fin while the others swam around in random directions to potentially catch it as the first orca dropped its "toy". Among some of the vessels offshore, we saw another eight whales in a closer group. Based on the vocalizations we heard on the hydrophone, we were seeing a very spread out resident pod of orcas. As we continued around the northern part of San Juan Island and then Henry Island we saw more bald eagles on Henry and Battleship islands, both perched at the tops of their respective trees scanning the sea. At O'Neal Island, we saw one more bald eagle and then headed for home.

There were many, many [<b>orcas</b>] out off <b>San Juan Island</b> last evening. A guest took a photo and Serena ID'd the orca as Cappucino. The orcas were doing lots of fishing. The movements they were making near the surface - back and forth, back and forth - then there were some spy hops and some well, was it "love" in the water? The seabirds were partying on an outcrop. Sea Lions and Harbor Seal were all having a snooze - lazin' about.

At <b>7:30 this morning</b> I saw a blow when I was almost to the <b>Bremerton Shipyard</b> parking lot. I parked and looked out over the water and saw another blow between the parking lot and the floating mothballed ships.  The body with a very small dorsal fin came up and it looked smooth and black. I believe it was a Minke. It was about 8 minutes between blows and did not see it again. Looking at google images, it did look like a <b>humpback</b>...  the small fin looked like a ridge but was pointed in the back. Very slow, but strong and graceful movement. 
I could not see any white and the blow was very visible, about 3' diameter and maybe 8' tall.
<br/>Andrew Doerr
<i>With a visible blow and a pointed dorsal fin this sounds like a humpback, but a small gray whale died on a beach in Bremerton this morning, so it's possible that's what it was</i>.

<br/><br/>
We kept motoring south around the corner toward <b>False Bay</b>. Finally up ahead we saw dorsal fins. The big male [<b>orca</b>] that had been about 400 yards off our starboard side suddenly surfaced behind us. We motored away to get out of his path, but again he turned toward us and surfaced off our stern. The whales were cruising. There was a lot of direction change and I hope, for their sake, there was some epic hunting happening.

Today we had a wonderful encounter with my old friend, the <b>Minke whale</b> toward Salmon bank. There were birds fishing everywhere. Just a couple minutes of patience rewarded us with a Minke sighting a couple hundred yards away. We watched the whale surface a couple more times and then noticed another a little farther away. We watched as the little Minke repeatedly stole the fish out from under the feisty aggregation of sea birds. It is always amusing to watch the sneaky little Minkes in action. When we finally pulled away from the scene we were surprised as one last Minke surfaced just off our port side. It was a great way to wrap up the trip.
<br/>Laura, Naturalist, san juan safaris
<br/>*<br/>
I believe I sighted the <b>Long Beaked Common Dolphin</b> that has been frequenting <b>south Puget Sound</b> between<b> 8:10 pm and 8:35 pm</b>. just south of Boston Harbor Light and out in front of Burfoot Park ¼ to perhaps ½ mile offshore. The dolphin put on quite an aerial show and made at least a couple dozen high jumps and splashes sometime very near passing boats.   I was not particularly close to the animal and the light was starting to fade so even with a 300 mm lens on my older Nikon 100 digital camera I could not catch a lot of detail, but I did get some images which I have attached.

Today we encountered a group of <b>four killer whales off Kauai</b>. This is only the 2nd time we've seen killer whales in 12 years of field work in Hawaii (with over 1,500 odontocete sightings). When first found they were chasing a rough-toothed dolphin, although we were too far away to see the outcome of the chase. <b>We did manage to photo-identify all four</b>. More photos and information on the sighting on Cascadia Research project web page.

I have never seen whales actually pull into <b>Friday Harbor</b>. When we found the group of <b>J's</b> they were just north of the harbor. They were cruising slowly south. I was expecting total chaos. The whales continued lazily down the channel. More spy hops, a breach, lots of inverted tail slapping, and at one point one of the adults just laid on his back. It looked like they were enjoying the sunshine as much as we were. As the whales turned to corner in toward the harbor we departed and cruised south to find other wildlife. We saw seals, pups, eaglets, harbor porpoise, and even a school of fish. The sea was alive today. When we reached cattle point we turned around and headed back up the san juan channel toward the harbor.  The whales were still moving south, but had slowed to resting pace, slowly surfacing to breathe and taking some longer dives. Suddenly we got a call. Tucker the whale scat-sniffing dog had located his quarry.  We stopped where we were and watched Tucker work.He ran from side to side and wagged his tail furiously.Finally we saw the scoop go into the water and Tucker was rewarded with his tennis ball.

We slowed and went across Spieden Island. It didn't take much longer until we saw the first signs of <b>killer whales</b>; spouts were up ahead! Then dorsal fins! After watching for a few minutes we realized that there were a lot of whales, twenty plus, milling around in very close proximity to one another. It looked like there were members from both <b>J and K pod</b> in the group, and there was a very small, orange calf that didn't look like K44! (new calf possibly?!). A

Taken from shore as the large group of<b> orcas (Js and K13s)</b> very slowly made their way north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> late this <b>morning</b>. They had formed a giant resting line somewhere along the way, and maintained that resting pattern as they ever so slowly made their way north. They reached <b>Kellett Bluff at about 11:00 am</b>, but were still near there at noon. I think I saw little K44 in the mix. I believe there are other residents somewhere south of the Lime Kiln lighthouse.

At about <b>1:20pm</b> at <b>Eagle Point</b>... looks like <b>J17 </b>, but I'm not certain. Caught it on the way down-- it was a horizontal, low breach. The orcas have been enjoying Eagle Point a lot these days, and have been around here a few times today already!

The time the <b>Orcas </b>are spending off the south end of <b>San Juan Island, by False Bay,</b> showing classic foraging, fishing behavior, makes me hope they are feasting on the Chinook Salmon! Today, with the tides settling down, the beginning of a flood tide, <b>L-Pod and K-Pod whales</b> were going back and forth, in 3 large groups, in different directions, then joining up. Rumor was J-Podders too, although I wasn't able to ID or photograph the group over by Eagle Point. From about <b>2:55pm to 4:20pm</b>, we watched the <b>L-12's</b>, which includes L-25 Ocean Sun and L-41 Mega!, and K-20 Spock with her 7 year old son K-38 Comet and others. Again they did a lot of tail-fluke slapping the water. I have noticed this prevailing behavior this season, is it helping to stun the fish? A few spy hops, then some resting groups, with a male by himself offshore. Then they all went on very long dives, hopefully with full stomachs!

The [<b>orcas</b>] were milling between <b>False Bay and South Beach</b>. Boats were spread out across the channel in every direction and we assumed the whales would be too. We saw a massive dorsal surface inshore of us, followed by a couple of mid size and then baby K! He was active. Super active. Rolling, tail slapping, porpoising high out of the water. The rest of the whales seemed to be indulging him and there were bouts of activity here and there between the little guy and the others. I couldn't take my eyes off them. It was the most active I have seen the whales in a week or two. There were 5 or so whales in the little group. The best part was that they just milled; spinning, rolling, spy-hopping, and pec-slapping.

Up in the Swanson Channel off <b>North Pender Island</b>, we caught up with a mixed pod of orca whales. Both <b>J and K pods</b> were socializing in a group of about 15-20 individual orcas. One passenger assisted in confirming the identity of J-34 "Double stuf" (son to "Oreo," brother to "Cookie;" see a theme here?!). Back at the whales we saw the new baby, K44, swimming just next to and behind mom before we had to start making our way back to the harbor.

We found the whales around <b>Turn Point</b> headed south but they turned around as soon as we got there and started going north, which was perfect for us!

They were spread out, mostly feeding, but around <b>2:30</b> noticed some sea snake activity. as a group of 10 or 12 came by very close to Mystic Sea what a treat the water was dead calm, no motor noise anywhere, just the magic of whales breathing.

The sun came out on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> in the <b>late afternoon</b> a mile or so south of Lime Kiln St Park (at those great viewing sites along the road) and so did the <b>orcas</b>! We assume they were J pod, as we checked at the park earlier in the morning and were told that J pod was over in Oak Bay near Victoria at that time. When they came close to shore in the Lime Kiln area I got two photos. They were taken within four seconds of each other at 6:25pm. Note that a young whale is with the belly-up mom in one of the photos.   
Most of the whales swam back and forth along this area for at least 1 hours, obviously feeding. Didnt get a count of just how many were there in total, but certainly there were at least 15 and probably many more than that - spread out quite a bit from south of where we were watching to north of us at the viewing spot up at lime kiln state park. Lots of breeches, spy hops. Males were visible farther out. By 6:30 pm or so 3-4 whale watching boats arrived on the scene.

<b>[Orcas] at Eagle Cove</b> Today! This <b>morning around 7:30</b> I heard the whales loud and clear before viewing them! It sounded like Jurassic Park at Eagle Cove! HUGE slaps, claps and cannon ball sounds! The water was flat and glassy and their blows echoed against the rocks. I ran out to the edge of the bluff as I didn't want to miss viewing this early morning party! The whales closest to shore approached from the North around Eagle Point. They were frisky, tail lobbing and pec slapping, some looked to be chasing fish back and forth. While further out into the strait there was a BIG party going on! Huge breaches by multiple whales, full body out of the water over and over again. I counted over 30 breaches in a 30 minute period. Although the breaching was far out in the strait, the loud clapping sound as they hit the flat surface of the water carried across the strait in warp time! The whales closer to shore turned around and headed north again, the group further out in the straight finished their acrobatics and turned towards shore, following the route of the others, about 15 minutes behind them. What a beautiful way to start the day!

We continued on through Cattle Pass and quickly found a great group of <b>Orcas near False Bay</b>. As we slowly approached and started watching one group, we saw even more whales in every direction around us. The word from other vessels on the scene was that <b>Ks and Ls</b> were moving in to the area to hang out with the <b>Js</b>. It seemed like just about every member of the Southern Resident Community was spread from close to shore to the Olympic Peninsula. It was incredible! Unfortunately we had to head back to the harbor, but on the way we encountered a<b> Minke whale</b> as well as the most harbor seals I've ever seen around the boat playing and feeding in the tide rips.

We headed south out of Friday Harbor this afternoon with word that there were killer whales around <b>False Bay</b>. Once at False Bay we caught a glimpse of three dorsal fins and some spouts, then there were six+ dorsal fins all coming up from underneath the glassy Salish Sea. It was <b>J-pod</b>. They were slowly traveling close to each other, nearly synchronized in their surfacing. After spending some time with the whales, we headed back towards Salmon Bank. As soon as we got to that area, we spotted <b>a single minke whale</b> and watched it surface a few times before it disappeared into the depths.

We received a call at <b>5:38 pm</b> from JR Zamore (sp?), reporting sighting <b>1 orca whale </b>while bottom fishing off <b>Westport</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> porpoised north along the west coast of <b>San Juan Island</b>, as each breath exposed most of their flanks. Traveling at great speeds, the orcas manipulated the drag of water to propel their colossal bodies forward and out into the frictionless air. The pod was separated into smaller groups which were in tight formations. We identified Riptide (J-30) in the first trio and later saw a group of four which included Mike (J-26). The excitement continued as we entered the narrow chutes of Cattle Pass on our return to Friday Harbor.  Within the strong currents our boat strained through, there were over thirty harbor seals enjoying the food it transports. Once back in calm waters, we were suddenly surrounded by numerous harbor porpoises which are normally elusive and seen individually or in small groups. We turned off the engine and listened to their exhales as they passed in front and behind our boat.

Heard reports of Orca Whales by<b> Anacortes at 9am</b>, then in<b> Rosario around 1pm</b>, then heading west, south of <b>Lopez at 2pm</b>, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where we watched groups of<b> J-Pod</b> going by <b>Cattle Pass </b>at about <b>2:45pm</b>! They slowed down as they hit Salmon Bank, as they typically do, spreading out, milling about, tail fluke slapping, rolling, and foraging in the strong 10+ flooding tide. Young whales breached passing Cattle Point Lighthouse! Mom-calf pairs stayed closer to shore, as they often do. I ID'd J-27 Blackberry, J-31 Tsuchi, J-22 Oreo and her kids J-38 Cookie and J-34 DoubleStuf, J-28 Polaris with 2 year old daughter J-46 Star. We thought we spotted J-26 Mike, by his left leaning dorsal fin, up with a group off of Granny's Cove. The sun came in and out, the water was like a pond. Now <b>4:15pm</b>, a juvenile <b>Minke whale</b> (Christy Hynde-Bank's calf?? Minke calves spend about 6 months with mom) foraging by Salmon Bank! I wonder if the Minke socialized with J-Pod, like the one did last season?

Between <b>noon and 1pm</b> several <b>orcas </b>made the trek past the <b>south end of Lopez</b>. They were traveling very slowly and reversed directions several times out from Flint Beach. There were about 10 orcas, not traveling together. Well, I just looked out to see another orca going past now at <b>2pm</b>. I almost missed this one as the whale watch boats had all left. Correction, the whale watch boats are first coming into view now. The marbled murrelet study boat is getting a good orca trip too. So far I have seen 6 in this orca group, traveling east to west.

North out of the harbor and across the Haro Strait (and the US/Canadian border) to <b>Saturna Island</b>. And what did we find? The largest of the dolphin (odontocete) species: <b>killer whales</b>! Upon arriving to the scene, passengers saw three whales off our port, with another one off our bow and more coming from the east at our starboard. A large male was swimming behind us about 5oo yards in the shipping channel. He seemed to be the one to rev things up in the pod; this male gave two full clear-the-water breaches before resorting to some tail slaps as a tanker ship was about to pass through southbound. Word in the pod must have spread that it was active time, and multiple orcas-including several precocious calves-began breaching, tail slapping, peduncle throwing and upside down tail slapping repeatedly. And then again. And then some more! This continued for at least thiry minutes and was still going on intermittently when we had to leave for home port. Our hydrophone (underwater microphone) indicated that it was a very spread out and vocal resident whale (salmon-loving/eating) pod.

Heading south out of Friday Harbor we turned on the speed and booked it <b>towards Cattle Pass</b>! We first arrived on scene to a nice spread out pod of <b>Orcas</b>, looking to both our left and right there were orcas near and far! They seemed to be traveling in a "zig-zag" pattern, which is notorious to feeding habits, so we dropped our hydrophone in to take a listen! Sure enough they were "clicking" and vocalizing! We sat in silence and awe as we listened to the clicks get louder and louder, we couldn't see them as they were on a longer dive, but we could hear them! Soon enough a mother and calf came to the surface and let us have a really good look.­ It was <b>K-27</b> and her brand new (less than a week old) calf <b>K-44</b>! The new calf seemed to be exploring his new abilities with his tiny 6-7ft body as he porpoised and splashed through the surface of the water.
We sat in silence for a while as the mother and calf made their way off and just when we thought we got our last look at them they reappeared with over 16 other members of K Pod!! We watched in awe as the pod grouped all together and headed straight for the boat! We were stuck where we were and surrounded by orcas! Gracefully as ever, they skimmed the surface headed straight for the boat, they sank right under the water calmly passing underneath and resurfacing on the other side! It was so amazing to see how aware of us they were as we were to them! I don't think they had as much fun watching us as we did watching them as they slowly moved away from our boat, all in unison and synchronized perfectly. At this point we were all stunned and amazed!

I was out fishing off of Secretary Island in <b>Sooke </b>with a pink salmon on the line when a pod of <b>about a dozen orca</b> rolled through the area around <b>noon</b>. A large male was definitely heading straight for us and went under the boat. We netted the fish just before it became whale food. The pod was heading towards Race Rocks spread out over a half km.

We decided to go see <b>J Pod</b> at <b>Turn Point</b>, and by the time we headed up north they were already approaching the Pender Bluffs in Canada. We watched as a very large group of Js were slowly moving their way along the shoreline. <b>J27</b> and gang were definitely checking out the kelp beds, and at one point, the whales were being watched on all sides-us on the outside side of the whales, and harbor seals and people along shore. Lots of surface percussives including spyhops and breaches! Time passed far too quickly and soon it was time to head back to port.
<br/>A quick lunch break and we left the dock, <b>Ks </b>were still doing the "west side shuffle" along <b>San Juan Island</b>. And as we headed out of Cattle Pass, we took a wide swing out past Salmon Bank and found a small <b>minke whale</b>. Flat calm waters made spotting the whale from quite a distance easy! Before long, we were off again to go see K Pod. We were only with Ks for a bit before they suddenly veered offshore and began to vocalize quite loudly. This just so happened to coincide with a call on the phone from one of our Canadian friends who told us that the members of <b>L Pod</b> that had been out west had made it to <b>Discovery Island</b> and were headed right towards San Juan. So a short reposition and soon we were viewing over 30 members of L Pod! L79 Skana. L41 Mega. As the whales got closer to K Pod, they began to slap the water with their tails. At one point there were 6-7 whales tailslapping at the same time. One female passed the Western Explorer and decided to push her calf onto her rostrum! Lots of vocals, spyhops, a few breaches, and the whales began to mill everywhere at once!  Soon though it was time to head back, but we did manage to find <b>3 more minkes (for a total of 4)</b>.

Today at <b>1:15 PM orcas</b> were just approaching Land Bank's Westside Preserve on <b>San Juan Island</b> when they turned south. I, too, went south to American Camp, where the whales passed still heading south between 2:15 and 2:45 PM. Some animals were several miles offshore, but the <b>K12s and K14s</b> passed fairly close to shore at the point near Grandma's Cove.

Members of <b>J pod</b> slowly headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> this morning. <b>J2 Granny</b> was in the lead. I heard <b>J8 Speiden</b> not too far behind. I'm not an expert on identifying individual orcas, but it seemed like the orcas were traveling more or less in family groups -- the J14s with little J45 and several other orcas, the six J17 family members along with a few other orcas, etc.

Yesterday <b>afternoon Lpod </b>was east bound, past <b>Victoria</b>, heading to Eagle point to meet up with the K's. Lots of vocals from Lpod, and I heard on the radio Kpod was vocalising loudly as well, as the two groups were getting closer.

Aboard the Island Explorer 3 on the early morning we encountered a <b>Minke Whale at Salmon Bank</b>. Then we headed north and saw a few <b>K's</b> heading South. There were others spread out on all sides of the boat. As the other whales traveled northbound, the southbound Orcas change direction. We soon found ourselves among the K's. I spotted K-40 Raggedy, K-21 Cappuccino &amp; K-26 Lobo. We spotted K-27 Deadhead with her new calf K-44 swimming right next to mom learning the ropes. He looks so small in comparison to a mature male like Cappuccino. Lots of happy tail slapping, pec slapping, a spyhop by the young ones and one spectacular headstand. We couldn't ID everyone but we did see K-13 Skagit, K-25 Scoter, K-31 Cali, K-20 Spock &amp; K-38 Comet. They ended up in 4 groups traveling Northbound.<br/>Vicky Miller-SSAMN Marysville, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
These <b>orcas </b>just came by heading north where they turn and typically go through <b>Active Pass</b> after passing the north part of North Pender Island. Before I saw any I could hear breaches south of me. As they came into my view no breaches were observed, however, they were in quite close to the shore this time. They were moving relatively quickly, passing by here from about <b>12:10 to 12:40 p.m</b>. How gorgeous are these lovely orcas!  How lucky are we that they are still on the planet and here in the Salish Sea, despite our constant effort with myriad manners to mess up their environment.

Another beautiful day as we motored toward <b>False Bay</b>. As we drew closer we could see dorsal fins here and there. We sat, turned off the engines and observed whales in every direction. We were watching a female moving along our port side when we spied a mini dorsal fin on the other side of her. It was the smallest <b>orca </b>I have ever seen. When we dropped the hydrophone our suspicions were confirmed. We heard the familiar kitten-like calls of K pod. It could only have been the new baby K I have heard so much about over the last few days. The mom and calf moved but we sat and observed other individuals moving through the area. We listened to faint calls and it was even calm enough to hear echolocation noises.

Around <b>10:15 am</b>, a small group of <b>5 or so orcas</b> (transients?) went east with the tide past our Orca Rock in <b>Active Pass</b>. Then later: We came back to our place from gathering wild strawberries just in time to catch the last 10 or so whales passing by, heading east through Active Pass around <b>2:15 pm</b>. Whales twice today!

<br/>*<br/>
Out on the Island Caper for a tour, headed up north into Plumper Sound (BC) to try and catch <b>J pod</b> headed towards <b>Active Pass</b>. Timing was perfect - we found them in resting mode (all tight together, slowly going along and surfacing all at the same time) just before they entered the Pass. We followed slowly behind as they went through (LOTS of boats in the Pass, including 2 huge BC ferries, and many rec/sport and whale watch boats) - hugged the north shoreline tightly and could see they were starting to "wake up" - spreading out, surfacing at different times, tail lobbing, upside down swimming. And once they hit the open water of Strait of Georgia, all heck broke loose - they started breaching, spyhopping, lots of tail smacks, lunging - what a show! We even saw a double breach (caught on film)!!  This continued for a good half hour, and about half way across the Strait, we unfortunately had to say goodbye to head back south. Another gorgeous day out there - flat calm waters - we could still see the whales cavorting many miles off as we headed home. Doesn't get much better than that - thanks, Capt. Don!

<b>Orcas </b>headed south along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> this <b>afternoon</b>.

Around 2:30pm from shore at <b>Lime Kiln</b> -Whale Watch Park. I assume they are the mixture of <b>J and K pods</b> that have been referred to earlier. Noted that there were two young whales in this group, not necessarily in the pictures. I saw a very young one, and the young one in the pictures.

(<b>orcas &amp; minke</b>) Up the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> it didn't take long to see a blow, and then another, and another. Stretching from shore to about a mile or so out were groups of fours and fives traveling mostly south. Just the M/V Sea Lion, about <b>20 Orcas</b>, and 40 very happy passengers. We shut down the engines and watched the animals slowly moving down island. We even had a chance to drop the hydrophone and pick up some incredible vocalizations. Its hard to describe the overall feeling on the water. But with no wind, no waves, no other boat noise, the backdrop of the olympics, clear views of Mt. Rainer as well as Mt. Baker, good Orca vocals on the hydrophone, and the sound of whales breathing, the first word that comes to mind is peaceful. We even saw some breaches, some porpoising, and some tail slapping. Then, on the way home, we saw a single Minke feeding around whale rocks, as well as a dozen harbor seals hauled out and lazing in the water.

As we rounded <b>Henry Island</b> along the northern end of <b>San Juan Island</b>, we headed south along the Haro Strait and began to see boats in the distance spread out over several miles. Upon closer viewing, those boats happened to have numerous southern <b>resident killer whales</b> around them! We saw some orcas tail slapping or tail lobbing and one even tail slapping on its back! At one point, we had a large male swimming straight for us! We pulled forward to give him some space and eventually he turned towards another boat; was this a curious whale investigating his surroundings? Over the radio we heard that we were seeing a mixture of <b>J and K pods</b>.

We met up with southbound [<b>orcas</b>] in <b>Haro Strait</b> at about <b>3:00pm</b> between Spieden and San Juan Island. Radio reports told us that the group closest to us included <b>K44</b>. Members of this tight, somewhat synchronized group included <b>K25, K20, K38, K13 and K27 with K44</b> tucked along either the outside or in between mom and K20. Each time J44 surfaced he was underneath a huge stream of bubbles from his exhalation (see photo below) - still getting his breathing timing down? A whale spyhopped close by. Checking out what all the ruckus was about? Group continued south - one adult whale rolled over and did a mouth-open inverted tail lob. Tail lobbing by K20 and K38. A few members broke off for a bit of foraging. A couple other members were further offshore, porpoising south, Another couple groups went by, <b>J2, J8, and J47</b> included. There were some cartwheels and breaches, one of which was by L87 - and he got total air - 100% out of the water. Awesome. We departed around <b>3:50</b>, the trailing group just having passed south through Spieden Channel.

'The little fella', <b>K44</b>, was sticking close to Mum (Deadhead - K27) and shore off <b>Saturna Island</b> at <b>2.00 pm</b> today. The weather was calm, and with the engines cut back on 'Mystic Sea' we could hear the blows as K pod traveled and foraged, some in small tight groups, others on their own.

There's a theory among whale watch captains that whales breach more when the waves are choppier. Last night's trip was definite proof for that theory! As we traveled northwest (up west <b>San Juan Isl</b>), sea spray was blowing over the bow and the port side of the boat; everyone took shelter. But then finally, our efforts paid off and we began to see dorsal fins and whale breath about 400 yards off our starboard bow: <b>L-pod</b>. We came about to travel behind the southbound killer whales. The chop and wind continued but the whales seemed to love it because just then, the breaching began! And I don't just mean one or two breaches, I mean forty to fifty over the course of thirty minutes!  We had baby orcas breaching, whales breaching in call-and-response style, three whales breaching in a row, two whales breaching simultaneously, three baby whales breaching side by side, on and on.  And then, the ultimate: a large mature adult male fully cleared the water in a breach! Was he showing the whale calves how it's done? Were we witnessing a teaching seminar on the how-tos of impressive breaching?  We were surely impressed as humans watching!

On the ferry back to Anacortes I was in the midst of my Orca Network/Whale Museum killer whale ferry talk when a passenger informed me of orcas off our starboard, just east of the <b>Lopez ferry dock</b>. The ferry slowed, and a worker announced "two baby orcas" had been sighted. In reality, mom and a youngster. I saw one surfacing, then they dove deeper, eluding the ferry and we moved on.

The rumors of a <b>superpod </b>have been confirmed. For about 45 minutes this morning, orcas paraded by, headed north  While some were porpoising their way north either single file or in small groups, others were headed north at slower speeds but in larger groups. In the middle of all the porpoising action, there was a small resting group. Meanwhile, some orcas were lying on their backs, slapping their tails. I believe I saw some Js, some Ks, and some Ls -- too many to count. Some were closer to shore, but others were probably nearly a mile off shore. Later this afternoon I started hearing vocalizations on the OrcaSound hydrophone. It appeared that there were orcas lingering west of Kellett Bluff. A few other orcas were porpoising from the south.

As we journeyed up and over to the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> we discovered a large pod of <b>15+ killer whales</b> in <b>Haro Strait</b>; all surfacing and traveling in perfect synchronization. We believe this pod was made up of several members from both J and K pods. We were excited at the opportunity of spotting the very NEW (2 day old!) calf from K pod, it was hard to try and get a look as there were so many in the group traveling all together! Very exciting to see! We left the orcas as they continued to travel northbound and made our way to Gooch Island, just over the Canadian border, to find some harbor porpoise!

<b>~10 am</b>: Forecasting a Super Pod day!!! Another huge group of whales just visited <b>Eagle Cove</b> also heading north! (probably 20 mins behind the first group). We viewed at least <b>30+ whales</b> (I believe part L's) very playful and exhibiting what I would call sensual behavior! Again, same pattern of multiple breaches off of Granny's Cove, so interesting to view this exact same behavior with each group the last several days. They paused off Eagle Cove, gathered into a tight group, lots of surface time, then started rolling around, doing the whirly-twirly, lots of tail slapping and spy hopping! Finished off with a few cartwheels and partial breaches! They have just passed Eagle Point heading north and are out of view, yet I can still hear them partying...loud blows and slaps on the water! Still not a boat in sight! At one point, a large group of the whales stopped traveling and gathered close together, all fins at the surface like a line up! They went down very briefly, followed by what I perceived to be sensual, tactile behavior, rubbing against each other, almost like caressing one another at the surface, then lots rolling and twirling close together (I call that "whirly twirly") and lots of tail slapping! I could not view a sea snake from my vantage point, but I would imagine that was present based on the behaviors! (<i>this is a perfect description of a Greeting Ceremony and Superpod - sounds like an amazing morning off San Juan Island! ON</i>)

<br/>After we got back from our WW tour, we heard that there were up to <b>a dozen Orca</b> at Bates Beach about b this morning!! Confirmation by one senior guide that at least 1 large male. No direction.
<br/>Jack, Campbell River Whale Watching
<br/><b>2 pm</b>: Just North of Campbell River by Brown's Bay and Seymour Narrows a group of <b>3 of the Transients</b> were spotted by AJ, Painter's Lodge.
<br/><b>2:30 pm</b>: Through broken radio transmission I heard that there were <b>"some" Orca</b> by McMullan Point, Dent Rapids. I believe it was Warren on Tenacious 3, Discovery Marine Safaris.

Jill Hein of Coupeville was camping at <b>Deception Pass State Park</b>, and called at <b>4:50 pm</b> to report <b>8+ orcas</b> in Rosario Strait, heading south, with more splashes further out in the Strait. At least one male was present - they were too far off to ID.
<br/>*<br/>
Doug Smith called at <b>4:35 pm</b> from West Beach, <b>Deception Pass State Park</b>, to report a pod of <b>3 or 4 orcas</b> leaping out of the water in<b> Rosario Strait</b>, about 500 - 600 yards off shore, putting on a show.

Orca Network saw a Facebook post this afternoon from Island Adventures Whale Watching about <b>a new calf in K pod</b>, then shortly after received the photo and report above from Jane Cogan, then confirmation from Astrid van Ginneken of the Center for Whale Research that a new calf was photographed today with K27, and designated "K44" by the Center for Whale Research. While they were photographing the whales and getting ID shots of the new calf, K27 rolled under her new baby, and lifted him up so they could see the markings on the underside and determine that K44 is a male (gender often isn't known for weeks, months, or sometimes years)!

The Center for Whale Research went out in several of their research boats to photo ID the new group of Southern Resident orcas who came into the Salish Sea today. They confirmed that members of <b>L pod</b> have returned, but seas were choppy and the whales were very spread out, and all the photos haven't been seen yet, and so far all of L pod has not been ID'd. They saw K27 with her new calf, K44, and K27 rolled under her baby and lifted him as CWR photographed, so they were able to see right away that it was a boy! 
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>2 pm</b> this afternoon there were orcas moving quickly with the tide, heading east through <b>Active Pass</b>, past us at our Orca Rock. A group of about 8 - 10 led the way, in a resting line for awhile. They were followed at a large distance by a pair and another pair trailed behind them. Cheers, 
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, BC
<br/>*<br/>We emerged in the <b>Rosario strait</b>. A moment later, we saw them: <b>four orcas</b> surfaced about 220 yards now off our port side, the eerie fog surrounding them.
As we watched the whales, another group surfaced behind us with three more individuals. With the fog, it was difficult to see how many whales there were and in what groupings. Two here, five there; three this way, six more that way! Then all of a sudden, they vanished on a dive. We shut down our engines and waited, each passenger scanning a different direction. When they finally surfaced, there were about twenty orcas together in a tight group, just off our stern! We could hear the poof-poof-poofs of their exhalations. At a glance, we determined that there was a mix of J and L pods, with identifications of a male, "Mega" (L-41), and a female, "Princess Angeline" (J-17). As we were getting our last glimpses of the whales, the fog lifted and we welcomed back the sunshine.

Early this morning resident <b>orcas </b>slowly headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. I saw the usual leaders, J2 (Granny) and J8 (Speiden) at about <b>7:25 am</b>.

We took a long trip north today with reports that there were <b>killer whales</b> hanging around <b>Saturna </b>in Canadian waters. The ride out was beautiful. The sun was shining, there was a clear view of Mt. Baker, and the waters were calm and glassy. What's even better is that the trip up was totally worth it; J-pod was in the area. We were able to identify Riptide and Slick amongst the individuals we encountered.

<b>J pod</b> was spread out along the southwest coast (<b>San Juan Island, WA</b>) in smaller groups.

We had a report of <b>3 Orca</b> in Calm Channel outside of Churchhouse this afternoon at about <b>2pm</b>. As the boater had already returned to the dock so the sighting was likely at about 12 or 1230pm. No one was able to find them - and between all the tour operators that were out we covered a lot of ground. Nonetheless, still an amazing day on the water, great Eagle Show at Jimmy Judd island with about 100+ eagles.

We were boating near <b>Kingtson </b>when <b>two large Humpback whales</b> appeared out of nowhere! They were playing and jumping fully out of the water making huge splashes. They were playing for about a 1/2 hour and then disappeared. We got some great shots of them on the calm water. Also, there must have been 20+ dolphin-like creatures surfacing on the water all around us with the whales. I couldn't believe how many there were (<i>these were likely Harbor porpoise ON</i>).

Of the <b>two humpback whales</b> photographed by Scott Zaffram one (thin patches of white on fluke) matches the Point no Point whale that Jeff Hogan was able to get good photos of June 2.

It was a confusing morning -- first <b>resident orcas</b> headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, then south, then north again.

We found the big guys; <b>killer whales</b> were off in the distance! We watched some younger juveniles lob-tailing and a group of four swim eloquently by. Then, in another direction a single large male dorsal fin sliced through the water attracting everyone's attention.

We rounded Cattle Point and headed up the west coast (<b>San Juan Isl</b>). We quickly encountered <b>orcas </b>which appeared to be feeding with thrashing and direction changes along with a few breaches and tail lobs. After being lucky enough to watch the unique behavior, we headed back south. Trip 2: We headed south with word that there were killer whales heading towards <b>False Bay</b>. Shortly after, there were spouts in the distance. It was <b>J-pod</b>! After seeing the first spouts, dorsal fins came up from all directions. One male was identified as Blackberry.

This afternoon from <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> we watched two groups of whales come across <b>Haro Strait</b> from Discovery Island. They were very spread out by the time they reached <b>San Juan Island</b>, and they slowly moved north past Lime Kiln from about <b>1:45 - 5:15 PM</b>. The back-lighting made it hard to get IDs, but J8, J16, and J34 were all in this group. The whales never disappeared from view to the north, and their blows were visible for a long time before they passed the lighthouse again heading south at 8:00 PM.
