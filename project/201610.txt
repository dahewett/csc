<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
  
<b>4:04 p.m. -</b> seems to be feeding just off <b>Dalco Passage Viewpoint</b>, to the right. Trees blocking view, but can hear it surface. Think it changed direction and is going towards Owen Beach now.
<br/><b>3:54 p.m. - from Dalco Passage Viewpoint Pt. Defiance</b>, surfacing below and a little to the right of the viewpoint, about 200 yards off the beach, heading west towards the actual "Point". -Melissa Burke

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">October 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

The Morris family saw, from a B.C Ferry, <b>a humpback breaching multiple times close aboard Snake Island (Departure Bay, B.C.), October 30/16 @1430 hrs.</b> -Rod MacVicar, Pacific WildLife Foundation

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I was out there on my single outrigger canoe with <b>the gray whale</b> for over an hour. So bummed I didn't have my camera, but still an awesome experience.  Whale was doing an oval pattern <b>just inside of West Beach</b>. I first saw it as I rounded<b> Deception Island</b> and was <b>heading for the bridge</b>. The whale was <b>heading out (west)</b>, then went down for a couple minutes and came back up heading east towards the bridge. Did this for at least an hour, then headed west once the ebb got strong. -Jason Michael Park

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw this Beautiful Big Guy on our walk this evening! I was so captivated at this moment and so delighted to finally get to take pics of a Whale <b>(Humpback)...We saw him at Point Ruston and followed him to Owens Beach</b>, as the sun was setting. -Desiree Sauve

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:05 p.m. - </b>Watching the whale from <b>Dalco Passage</b>. He/she milled around a bit seeming to be going south toward Narrows Bridge but than started back west toward Owens. We moved to Anthony's to watch but it just got too dark. -Ronda Walters

It was a special treat  to see <b>L-Pod off the west side of San Juan Island</b>. First, it was a treat because seeing any orcas at the end of October is always awesome, but second, it was <b>ALL of L-Pod</b> traveling together! You might think being a "pod" this would happen more often, but it's a pretty rare sight! They were all in one tight, traveling group when I first saw them, making it even more impressive. -Monika Wieland Shields

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Bittersweet this Friday evening... Orcas came in this <b>afternoon</b>. I believe <b>L pod</b>. So as I watched the orcas tonight, they were beautiful. Bunched up tightly, in two groups. Most likely all in touching distance from one another. Rising to the surface together, pausing together, then going back down in shallow dives. So quiet, and still. I can not help but wonder, do they realize that two more are gone? If this was L Pod... surely they all know the individuals in J and K Pods. Were they honoring J28 and her calf, J54... Mourning them perhaps? -Cher Renke

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1651 Lags (Pacific white-sided dolphins) passing Lime Kiln</b> now too, offshore
<br/><b>1614 L12s are Northbound</b>, others still milling off<b> Lime Kiln</b>
<br/><b>1604 </b>They're just milling now, Maybe ever so slowly Northbound again.
<br/><b>1537 They made it to whale watch point then turned</b>....Southbound further offshore now. But not moving fast at all and off Land Bank.
<br/><b>1530 approaching Land Bank</b>
<br/><b>1515 (L pod) close to shore Hannah Heights Northbound</b>. -Monika Wieland Shields

<br/><b>5:00 p.m. -  viewing from Owens Beach. Humpback</b> is northbound about to pass Owens beach close!
<br/><b>4:39 p.m. - viewing from Dalco passage</b> it's moving north now.

<br/><b>4:20 p.m. - viewing from Dalco Passage</b>. Just surfaced and is headed south (whale location pinned on google map as middle of pass between Gig Harbor/Point Defiance/Vashon) -Brittany Gordon

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:40 p.m. - </b>Still milling about, just saw it (same as Brittany Gordons last specified location, <b>SE side of Vashon</b>).

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:23 p.m. -</b> watching from <b>Owens beach</b>. 8 minute down time. Appears to be closer to Vashon. Headed towards Gig Harbor or Colvos.. can't tell from this angle. -Brittany Gordon

<b>2:07 p.m. - Looking from Point Ruston...possibly 2 humpbacks? </b>Just past the point of the new park area - south of Vashon. -Cathy Baker

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:40 p.m. - Still off Pt Defiance</b>. -Mike Swanton

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:22 p.m. -</b> looks like it's awake &amp; on the move again. I saw it fluke and then surface a little North of where it had been hanging out. I have to leave but I last saw it <b>west of the ferry lanes</b>, North of the container ship - I was looking east towards the port from Sunrise.
<br/><b>11:56 a.m. - </b>for the last 5-10 minutes it's been in the same spot. I can see just a little bit of its body at the surface. It looks like it could be driftwood but then every once in a while there's a blow. Is it resting? I haven't seen this before. I'm watching <b>from Sunrise</b> with binoculars so it's pretty far &amp; hard to tell what I'm seeing
<br/><b>11:40 a.m. - Just saw blows near Point Defiance</b>. It's traveling Northeast. Back towards the ferry. It's so calm and flat out there it's impossible to miss. -Heidi Powers Armstrong

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:30am -</b> Marie at WS Ferries reports <b>a humpback was seen 1/2 mile from the Point 
Defiance ferry dock</b>, heading west.

<b>Humpbacks in Tacoma October 21 &amp; 22 -</b> Feeding maybe, Mostly traveling I guess. They didn't vary course or speed for most of an hour. While sailing Friday <b>10/21 in Commencement Bay we saw 3 whales</b>. 1 large and 2 smaller ones. At first couldn't tell what type. They would roll 3 or 4 times to breath and then would show their flukes for a deep dive and wouldn't surface for 10 to 15 minutes. On the next day <b>(22nd) we were headed north in Colvos Pass up the west side of Vashon</b> when we came across what appeared to be <b>the same three whales</b>. They were headed north as well and were traveling about the same speed, 7 to 9 knots. We stayed on course and they paralleled us about 200 yards away. Same pattern 3 or 4 shallow rolls and then showed flukes and would stay under for 10 to 15 mins. Finally the large one breached out of the water and we were able to see all of the pectoral fins. Confirming it was a Humpback. They stayed with us nearly an hour. Made my day! The large one may have been over 30 feet. The others didn't breach out of the water. Hard to say how large, just that they were quite a bit smaller. Sorry, no pictures. -Dan Wainwright

October 21 - North Puget Sound - (Reported to NOAA as well) I'd like to report a sighting of <b>a (possible) entangled humpback </b>whale I noticed yesterday while on board the Chilkat Express. We spotted the whale circling and apparently feeding about <b>3-4 miles NW of the Edmonds Waterfront</b>. The whale continued to circle the same area during our entire encounter with it, which lasted around 20 minutes <b>between 1:15 pm and 1:36 pm</b>. The whale took deeper dives that lasted around 4 minutes after 3-4 shallower surfacings. Every time the whale attempted a deeper dive, it did not show it's flukes and it appeared the tail was being weighed down by something. You'll find attached a sequence of photos (see one below) I took of one of the whale's dives that seem to show a line of some kind wrapped around the lower part of the whale's peduncle. The photos have been cropped and resized to fit in the email, but are otherwise unaltered. The photos were taken yesterday, October 21st 2016 at 1:19 pm and we last saw the whale trending in a southerly direction though still apparently feeding....-Justine Buckmaster

Sadly, here are a few pictures of my last experience with <b>J28 (Polaris), and her son, J54 (Dipper) on October 11, 2016 in Saratoga Passage</b>.  During the experience with <b>J and K pod</b>, I remember feeling sad that J54 looked smaller than he should be for a calf his age, and that he definitely had the malnourished, "peanut head", look. I've never seen the peanut head phenomenon on a calf like this before. It was noticeable almost every time I saw him this summer, but it seemed particularly obvious on this encounter. J28 was one of my favorite's in J pod partly because she was so easy to identify from a long distance with the distinctive notch on her dorsal fin. If you were looking for the J17 subpod it was easiest to look for Polaris first. We all feel fortunate to be able to watch many of these killer whales grow up into adults and have calves of their own, but that also makes it especially sad when any of them passes away long before they naturally should. -Bart Rulon

Around <b>1pm</b> today, Oct 11th, we were hugely blessed with numerous resident orca sightings from<b> Bells Beach heading south through Saratoga Passage</b> about midway across the passage. There were about <b>10-12 in the 1st group and the next two groups which were traveling close behind had 3-5 in each of them</b>. Most were just traveling along with a spyhop and tail lob or two along the way. We were out in our kayaks about 200 or more yards away and still they were incredibly majestic to watch. Still shaking from the excitement of it all. Sorry no photos. Up to 20 total, at least 5-7 large males, many females and at least 1 baby. Traveling. -Kristin Carlson

As we cruised out of the marina, there were no whale reports, and the water was fairly choppy. Due to worse conditions south west, we headed inter-island north, and soon heard the <b>humpback Big Mama and her calf, Poptart</b>, were across the border at<b> Java Rocks, just west of Waldron Island</b>. After catching a quick look at some Steller Sea Lions and harbor seals, we had a nice look at one of our favorite females and her youngster. The water was still fairly rough, and they were skimming the surface, with long down times and no tail fluking. We then got word of Southern Residents heading south around Swansons Channel, and we caught up with them for a wonderful encounter with <b>members of J and K pods, including the very handsome males, K21 Cappuccino (30 years old), Blackberry J27 (28), and a younger male, Tika K33 (15). Also spotted were Notch (J47), Alki J36 (25) and her calf Sonic J42 (19 months),as well as another J pod mother and calf.</b> Reports were that almost all of J and Ks were spread out, heading south. They <b>reached Lime Kiln Park on San Juan Island in the early evening</b>. A wonderful day and a fitting finale of the 2016 Mystic Sea whale adventures! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Great day on the saltwater today! This AM: My son and I flew to the San Juans on a Kenmore Air floatplane to Lopez Island. The trip up was to pickup our boat following it's three week stay for its annual service. On the way home my son and I saw <b>two humpback whales (south of Lopez heading south)</b>, a Pod of <b>15-20 Dall's porpoises</b> (thanks to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for later Id'ing) - The porpoises came at us fast from 1/8 mile away then to our amazement played around right next to our boat for 10-15 minutes (crazy fast chasing each other, leaps, and dives -- unbelievable fun to see). Then, as we approached <b>the north end of Camano Island </b>we (my son actually) spotted large dorsals coming at us. We stopped for a few minutes and watched <b>a good size Pod of Transient Orcas</b> milling about as though on a kill (likely a sea lion). Great day! (although 3-4 foot swells with the wind picking up gets tiring out on open water!) (ID notes: Thanks again to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for subsequently Id'ing the Orcas - "These are the <b>T137s</b>. The big male with the two notches is <b>T137A</b>. They were probably with the <b>T100Bs</b> (they were last night when I saw them near Port Angeles) so the little one with them is T100B2 who was born earlier this year.") -Stu Davidson

I camped my butt in the sand against the big rocks at<b> Bush Pt from 3:30 to 6:30</b> to see these babies! I think last post before I headed down said they were mid channel South Mutiny Bay. Thats a lot of stalling but hoping they found lots of good eats out there...I know there is some good Chinook fishing south Mutiny Bay and before heading around the corner to Double Bluff. Once they came <b>in view from Bush Point around 6:15</b>, most were way out midchannel and further over. Dori and I first spotted them across towards Foulweather Bluff and entrance opening that goes towards Hoods Canal. Could barely see with naked eye, def needed binocs.

<b>5:30-6:15PM - </b>From a bluff <b>a mile south of Bush Point lighthouse</b>, at 100' elevation, the whales were 2-3 miles away, roughly mid-channel, where they usually travel.

Report from <b>9:45 to noon</b> today from <b>Bainbridge Island</b>.

Orcas were in a tighter group at this point and I counted 8+ bunched together hanging out in a patch of sun with the emerald city glistening behind them. Orcas continued north slowly with very little surface behavior. Chilkat came on the scene shortly afterward and whales spread out at that point. Connie, Kimberly and Aviva arrived and we watched from a distance for over an hour. The tug came by and we were too far away to see the surfing action you reported on ON. Around 11am we thought all whales were north and east on the other side of the channel, but a male and several females -and I'm pretty sure a couple of calves- appeared right below us very close to shore. We don't know how long they had been there but they soon made tracks and were porpoising to catch up the others which, at that point, which were well past Shilshole and on the east side of mid channel marker. -Susan Andersson

<b>10:44 a.m. - </b>From Richmond Beach seeing at least one orca porpoising the wake of a large tug east of mid channel out from just <b>north of Shilshole heading northbound</b>. Also seeing blows of others behind that action west of mid channel. Groups spread. Shortly after the wake surfing, larger group gathered, changed direction and milled for a few minutes mid channel out from Richmond Beach/Jefferson Head, Indianola. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:20 a.m. -</b> They're moving at a medium pace right now, <b>off Shilshole</b>. Lots of tail lobbing and spyhopping!
<br/><b>10:11 a.m. - We are at Discovery park</b> now and they are heading north! <b>All of them (J pod), one year old, J52 Sonic (of the J16s), J34 Doublestuf (of the J22 or "Cookie" matriline), J27 Blackberry, born in 1991, sister J31 Tsuchi and brother J39 Mako.

Late afternoon sun illuminates the blows of some of the members of <b>J &amp; K pods (&amp; L87) who passed Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island while traveling southbound Admiralty Inlet on what marks their first 2016 Fall arrival in Puget Sound. -Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
<b>Southern Residents came down Admiralty Inlet</b> today! Early afternoon reports came in of <b>Js and Ks heading south off Whidbey Island near Smith Island</b>, near Oak Harbor. We hoped they would head on down Admiralty and sure enough reports came in from <b>Ft. Casey, then Lagoon Point of Residents heading south fast off Marrowstone Island</b> in several groups, very active, much splashing. When we got to the lighthouse at <b>Bush Point just after 5 pm</b> beautiful backlit orcas were blasting tall sparkling blows in mid-channel, followed a few minutes later by four others including <b>J27</b>, much closer to the Whidbey side. Later more came south further out, all at the same steady pace, headed for Point No Point and Puget Sound. -Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b>6:30 p.m. - I left Point No Point </b>(PNP), the lead pack was traveling very quickly and must have been about half a mile to a mile south of PNP at that time I would expect them to be <b>approaching Edmonds</b> if they continue that pace. -Neil Hathi

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:34 p.m. -</b> Dorsal seen directly north of the <b>Point no Point </b>boat launch close to Whidbey shore headed South. -Melinda Barajas

<b>5:01 p.m. -</b> As soon as Howie called, I grabbed my scope and found them right away. They're off<b> Fort Flagler</b> (if that is the southern-most fort near Pt. Townsend). I first saw a splash, and then another splash, then a few blows. They're quite spread out and pretty far away, but I did not see any fins to speak of. There's a good-sized boat following them­doesn't look like a whale-watching boat. The whales do seem to be <b>heading generally south</b>, though a few are kind of wandering or milling. Thanks for the alert! -Elsa Leavitt

The approximate area we spotted <b>J and K pod</b> late morning into early afternoon was south of San Juans and west of the northern part of Whidbey. They headed in a south easterly direction <b>between Whidbey Island and Jefferson and Kitsap Penninsula</b>. Super awesome day for seeing such beautiful magnificent creatures, really took my breathe away, left me speechless at times. K20 Spock, born 1986 (mother to K38, daughter of K13) eastern Juan de Fuca. K22 Seiku (born 1987) on the left, eastern Juan de Fuca Strait, backdropped by Cattle Point, San Juan Island and Turtleback Mountain, Orcas behind. J17 Princess Angeline and her  nearly one-year-old daughter J53 Kiki (Kikisoblu). 15-year-old K33 Tika of the K12 matriline, eastern Juan de Fuca Strait -Marilyn Armbruster (<i>IDs by Sara Hysong-Shimazu</i>)

We were able to get off the dock a bit early, and motored out into Guemes Channel with glassy smooth water and sunshine, though with the feel of fall in the air. After checking out the lazy harbor seals on Colville Island, we happily caught up with some of J pod just south of Lopez Island. They were very spread out and heading south--we first spent some time with J17 Princess Angelina and her newly named 11 month old daughter, Kiki (the human Princess Angeline, Chief Seattle's daughter's nick-name). Also seen were J47 Notch (6 years old) and his mom J35 Tahlequah (18).
<br/>We then moved further south to catch up with quite a few of K pod, including K25 Scoter, a handsome 25 year old male, K22 Sekiu (29) and her son Tika K33 (15), K20 Spock (30) and her son K38 (just 12), and K43 Saturna (6), as well as others spread out across Eastern Bank, all heading south. They were later seen off the west side of Whidbey Island in the late afternoon. They were all very actively fishing, with great lunges through the water to pounce on the salmon, very dramatic and exciting! There were some breaches, a few tail slaps and a nice spy hop as well. It was yet another thrilling visit with about 20 Southern Residents, and very encouraging to see them eating and playing. All pictures taken with a 300mm zoom and cropped. K38 Comet (son of K20 Spock) traveling eastern Juan de Fuca earlier in the day before he and other members of J &amp; K pods (&amp; L87) headed into Puget Sound. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Infrequent visitors. While most everyone else was watching J and K pod residents heading for Puget Sound, the Island Adventures trip from Port Angeles encountered the <b>T038's west of Victoria BC</b>. These whales are rarely seen and it was my first encounter with them. -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

This is why I have a love affair with the Pacific Northwest. October 2nd we watched the <b>T036A and T065B </b>group of mammal-hunting transient orcas circumnavigate some of my favorite waters in the San Juans'. The evening lighting off Spieden Island was incredible and dynamic. I am so lucky! -Heather McIntyre

Around <b>noon</b> I stopped at the Suquamish Tribal Center on <b>Port Madison</b> and watched a pod of at least <b>8-10 Harbor Porpoise</b> surfacing from northbound towards the dock. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Another great morning off <b>Sooke, BC</b>, 6  minutes from our docks...we find <b>Transient/Bigg's killer whales (T123s)</b> hunting close to shore. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:15 a.m - Orcas</b>, I believe 6 Unidentified killer whales, seen <b>south west of Lasqueti and Texada - Georgia Strait</b>, heading north. -Jillian Rutledge
