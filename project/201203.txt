About <b>3 PM</b> one of the Victoria Clippers was with <b>a gray off Mabana Road</b>.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
There is <b>one gray whale</b> feeding between due south of us, just west of the <b>Camano Head/Hat Island</b> passage, about 200 yards off shore. We watched it feed in the same area for about five minutes, at <b>10:00 this morning</b>, before it headed out of sight towards Everett.  We've seen the whale here before this month, perhaps there is a new area of available food this year.

<br/>Margaret (Peggy) Sullivan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:20 am -</b> a call came in that there were <b>Hundreds of fast moving Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> between Black Point and Myrtle Rocks heading Northward towards <b>Powell River</b>. The ocean was a massive foaming boil from their fast maneuvers. They just seemed to disappear.
<br/>Bill Taylor
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:45 pm - Three Orca</b> two large dorsals and one small one were very slowly moving Northward right where the Dolphins (<b>Powell River</b>, above) had been. They were doing long dives and just taking their time.
<br/>Bill Taylor
<br/>*<br/>
Just spotted (<b>4:10 pm)</b> about <b>8 orca </b>of all sizes coming north up the middle of the <b>Malaspina Strait</b> past Myrtle Rocks. They were rolling and diving and tail slapping and one breach. Too far away for a photo unfortunately. 
<br/>Holly Roy
<br/><br/>
<b>March 29, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
The old salts who work at Lovric's boatyard in <b>Anacortes </b>said they spotted <b>an Orca</b> near their yard. That's unusual I think, or at least they think so.
<br/>John Shoosmith
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw <b>three Orcas</b> right off <b>Bush Point</b>, Whidbey island, heading south at <b>9:05 A.M</b>.

<br/>Jeff Lamarche
<br/><i><b>1120 to 1231 - </b>Jeff Lamarche called with a sighting of <b>J pod</b> in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, 4 miles east of Race Rocks, heading west to the open ocean, very spread out. He had <b>J34, J27, the J11s, J17s, J22s</b>, but there were others in the distance they were unable to identify.</i>
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod on OrcaSound</b> hydrophones <b>6:55am</b>, a lot of echolocation as well as loud calls! <b>7:17</b> can be heard over at <b>Lime Kiln</b> now as well. Echolocation very audible, much quieter waters
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
I woke up at <b>7:15</b> and saw at least <b>two KWs</b> southbound at <b>Orcasound</b>. Heard some <b>S4 calls on Orcasound hydrophones</b> and then switched to Lime Kiln where clicks and occasional calls have been heard over rising ship noise since ~7:20. Still hearing clicks.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod -  5:17 a.m.</b> - faint <b>J pod calls </b>on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b>. An hour later their calls were heard more clearly, still on Orca Sound hydrophones and soon began on Lime Kiln. I spotted one whale cartwheeling, south of Kelp Reef marker heading toward Discovery. Then at <b>Lime Kiln I spotted 4 whales </b>apx 1/2 mile from shore heading down island. I could then see another on the east side of Discovery Island heading out. The whales were spread all across Haro Strait heading down and west. 
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:11 AM - T calls on orcasound</b>. Calls getting louder on orcasound.....
<br/>John Boyd
<br/><br/>
<b>March 27, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>11:40 PM -</b> Great <b>calls </b>now.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient calls</b> on <b>Orca Sound hydrophones at 23:36</b>. They lasted for a while, then quiet. Picked up again at about 00:07 but were more faint.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde

<br/>*<br/>
Someone just came to my desk to say he saw <b>a gray whale</b> just offshore on the Northwest side of the <b>navy base</b>, Oak Harbor, earlier this afternoon.
<br/>Vicki Sawyer
<br/>*<br/> 
This is my first sighting of the year from my office, about <b>3:15 PM</b>.  A bit later in the year than usual but definitely <b>a single Grey whale</b> feeding about 500 feet out, West of the Norwester building (<b>Naval Air Station, Whidbey</b>). He/She seems to be awfully close to a group of commercial crab pots! Hope they don't get tangled up. This is just down a couple hundred yards South of the airfield runway itself. Gray whale is generally moving North at this point

<b>March 26, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Transients at Lime Kiln 22:57</b>. Occasional <b>transient calls</b> over last five minutes. Didn't hear on Orcasound previously. Also, the newly arrived Beam Reach students saw a Steller sea lion at Lime Kiln at 17:00 and I saw one at Orcasound at 1935. Both were heading south.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/> 
I was out for a daysail in <b>Commencement Bay, Tacoma</b> when this <b>pod of orcas</b> came cruising in at <b>6:30</b>. I was the only boat in the bay on a beautiful March day. This sighting made the day even more special. After a short while the group headed out of the bay going south. I have also posted more text along with the attached photos on our blog.
<br/>Michael R. Boyte
<br/>*<br/> 
Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries called Monday morning at <b>8:08 am</b> to report a pod of <b>3+ orcas</b> half way between <b>Pt. Wells and Kingston</b>, heading south into Puget Sound (likely the pod that was sighted in Commencement Bay later in the day, and most likely one of the Transient pods that had been off San Juan Island last weekend).
<br/><br/>
<b>March 25, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>9:19 pm - J pod on OrcaSound</b> now!
<br/>Gayle Swigart
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:16 pm - J Pod on Orcasound</b>! Heading north of <b>Kelp Reef</b> spread out all the way across Haro Strait....awesome vocals....
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/> 
Just chatted with Jeanne. <b>J Pod</b>, both As and Bs, with Granny, on the West Side right now about a mile off shore in the<b> Kelp Reef</b>-ish area. They came in late this afternoon, after our trip today. Some of my group got to see them from Lime Kiln after the trip with Jeannie Hyde, our naturalist. She took them to the light house to check out rumors, and after a while the reported "Transients" showed up. All of J Pod. I love those guys! 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/> 
At <b>3:30 p.m.</b> I spotted Granny<b> J-2</b> traveling north a half mile south of <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b>. Behind her, spread out for a great distance was the rest of <b>J pod</b>. The whales I saw were: <b>J-2, J-8, J-19, J-41, L-87, the J22s, the J34s, the J17s, members of the J11s, members of the J14s and members of the J16s - Mike J-26</b> being one of them. I last saw them north of Andrews Bay, more than a mile from shore, continuing north at 6:05 pm. Their <b>calls </b>could be heard on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b> until after <b>7 pm</b>. Pictures and more of the encounter posted on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/> 
After a call this afternoon from Jeanne, I made it out to the westside to see <b>J pod</b> very spread out in singles and small groups about midstrait heading north up <b>Haro Strait</b>. The whales made it north of CWR around <b>1810 </b>still mid strait.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Lamarche called with a report at <b>4:08 pm - the 8 - 10 Transients</b> they had been with were 4.7 miles SE of Seabird Rock/Discovery Island, heading SE toward Whidbey Island. At the same time, he had a call from Jeanne Hyde reporting <b>J pod</b> heading north up the west side of San Juan Island. She had ID'd <b>J2, J8</b> &amp; others off <b>Lime Kiln Park</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:15 pm -</b> Jeff Lamarche called with<b> 6-10 transient orcas</b> heading east about 3 miles south of <b>Discovery Island</b> in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
<br/>*<br/>
Two different groups of <b>Transient Orcas</b> sighted this morning, in the <b>Galiano and Moresby Island</b> area!
<br/>Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay, BC
<br/>*<br/>
Today at <b>2pm </b>we picked up <b>4 killer whales</b> including one male at 48/55 (<b>Monterey Bay CA</b>). They were heading steadily WNW at about 6 or 7 knots. We saw <b>another group of 3 whales</b> behind them about a half mile away moving in the same direction. We followed the first group for another 2 miles and then caught up with the group of three which consisted of just females/juveniles. We left around 3pm at 48/57. The two pods were closer together when we left but still separate and continued at the same clip heading WNW. There was a pod of 4 gray whales about a mile north of them. I couldn't match any of the shots with the photos I have, so it's a mystery pod as far as I'm concerned! Been a long time since we've seen some good killer whale action so we were pretty thrilled.
<br/>Kate Cummings, Blue Ocean Whale Watch
<i><br/>Three of Kate's whales are <b>CA20, CA54, and CA177</b>. Two other transients from Kate Cummings' "mystery pod" look like <b>CA58 and N160</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
A photo &amp; report of <b>2 Transients off Tofino</b> - they say it is T11 &amp; T11A - can anyone confirm these IDs?

We have a house on North Bluff Rd on the <b>Greenbank beach</b> side just in the elbow (2923 N Bluff).  Around 9am we had <b>two greys</b> about 200yds off the beach headed west towards the beach. Then around <b>1pm </b>we saw <b>two greys</b> on the other side of the harbor from our house cruising east towards baby beach. Very exciting especially this morning's show.
<br/>*<br/> 
I saw <b>3 gray whales</b>. West side of Camano Island, near Mabana (I think Lat 48, Long -122), <b>5:40 pm</b>, active &amp; feeding, headed north. They stayed within sight until about 7:30pm. This was my first sighting this year. They were very close in, so exciting! We usually see whales in this area every year in the spring. Feeding pits visible when tide is out.

<b>Three grays mid channel Saratoga Passage</b> one mile north of <b>Langley </b>now heading East to Camano Island.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:15 pm - Two greys</b> heading out of <b>Holmes Harbor</b> right now. First we've seen this year. There's a tour boat out there too.
<br/>Lori Christian
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:38 PM -</b> Neighbors to our south in <b>Beverly Beach</b> reported <b>gray whale(s)</b> feeding in front of their houses, moving north, close to shore, shortly before noon. We went down to the beach and followed.  Tom is quite sure there were two whales.  We followed their rolls and blows north as we walked along the shore. We last saw them off of Saratoga beach, south of the community beach area south of Baby Island, apparently feeding, about <b>12:45</b>. What a treat on this beautiful day.
<br/>Sally and Tom Cahill
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:10pm -</b> My husband and I observed what we think is <b>a grey whale</b> heading south from <b>Libby Road Park/Partridge Point</b> area (west side of Whidbey Island). L/L: 48.232434-122.765973. This solitary whale was first seen about 100 feet from our bluff when a huge spout was seen before it dove. It surfaced again close to the buoy just south of Partridge Point.  
<br/>Sue Zaveruha
<br/>*<br/>
<b>One Grey whale</b> sighted 100 yds off of <b>Beverly Beach</b> in Holmes Harbor at <b>11:40AM</b>. It appeared to be feeding heading north around the north point of Beverly Beach. We have seen other grey whales feeding in this area during past years.
<br/>David R Demorest
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:23 -</b> We found Patch just south of <b>Camano Head</b>, and followed him southbound along the east side of <b>Gedney Island</b>. We saw <b>two other grays</b> blowing in the distance off the Everett waterfront as well.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond
<br/>*<br/>
Today at <b>9:30</b>, we spotted<b> two gray whales</b> heading south in <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, near the old mussel farm. They were on the west side, and were traveling pretty quickly down the shore toward Nichols Boat Yard. We left them at about <b>10:25</b>. We believe it was Patch based on his Fluke and Dorsal ID. 
<br/>Deception Pass Tours
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:31 am - Honeymoon bay</b> (Holmes Harbor, Whidbey Island), right now! <b>Two gray whales</b>. Frolicking in the harbor!
<br/>Stephanie Chacharon
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:45 am -</b> My friends Colleen and Mike Klamm were out flying today and spotted <b>two gray whales in Holmes Harbor</b> today at <b>9:45 AM</b>. They were near the golf course and appear to be just resting facing the shore.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Quite certain it was <b>a gray whale</b> I just witnessed passing <b>Eagle Cove (San Juan Island)</b>, slowly moving north, fairly close to shore. It surfaced 3 times between Granny's Cove and Eagle Point! Lovely exhales!
<br/>Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill
<br/>*<br/>
On the <b>7:30 p.m. Coupeville-Port Townsend ferry</b> spotted <b>a minke whale</b> just a bit northeast of Port Townsend, not far from shore.

<b>March 24, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Jeff Lamarche, onboard the BC Whale Tour boat, called at<b> 4:40 pm </b>to report they were with the same group of <b>Transients</b> that was around yesterday - the four <b>T2Cs (T2C, T2C1, T2C2 &amp; T2C3), at Smallpox Bay</b>, west San Juan Island, heading slowly south.
<br/>*<br/>
John Boyd called at<b> 2:10pm</b> with the <b>T2Cs</b> near <b>Battleship Rock</b> (where Speiden Channell joins Haro Strait). The whales were generally milling with no direction of travel.
<br/>*<br/>
While hiking Ebey's Landing on the <b>west side of Whidbey Island, a single gray whale</b> was following the shoreline north around <b>3 pm</b>. Quite a few hikers were thrilled to see it. We noticed a couple of spy hops, but it mostly just seemed to be meandering north.  
<br/>DeDe Campbell, Coupeville, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>4:30 a grey whale</b> was seen at the mouth of <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, out from Greenbank beach. I watched it for about 20 min before losing sight of it.
<br/>Fran Banasick
<br/>*<br/>
We left <b>Patch </b>and another whale heading into <b>Crescent Harbor</b> (Oak Harbor) at <b>5:00 p.m</b>. this evening.
<br/>Deception Pass Tours
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4-6pm - Two grays</b> feeding in shallow water just north of <b>Langley</b>, easily visible from the Langley waterfront.
<br/>Rob Plaza, Camano Isl
<br/>*<br/>
<b>At 4PM</b> saw spouts off Forbes Pt/Seaplane Base area outside <b>Oak Harbor</b>. In 100 to 130 feet of water,<b> a single gray</b> continually stayed in this same area. Surfacing to spout a few times, then would roll, show its fluke/dive and each time stay submerged for 5 to 8 minutes. Sure seemed obvious feeding on something, but what? Left gray at <b>5:30PM</b> with sun shining above Olympics. As, I headed back to Mariner's Cove, looking back from [Polnell Point] could easily see the spouts shoot up into the air from a distance of a couple of miles away.
<br/>Robert Stonefelt
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:40 pm - Patch</b> is moving north 5 miles south of <b>Oak Harbor</b> 1 mile off shore and another about 2 more miles south of us and just heard of <b>another gray just off Rosario beach</b> at Deception Pass.

Ranger Hawkins at the <b>Pt. Reyes CA Lighthouse</b> called Orca Network to report that at about <b>3 pm, 8-9 orcas apparently killed a gray whale calf</b> within 10-15 feet of the rocks below the lighthouse, while about 35 people looked on. The episode that was witnessed lasted only about 3 minutes, after which the mother of the calf continued northward. Unfortunately no photos are available to identify the orcas or the gray whale involved.

Call from Garry Henkel of <b>7 to 10 Orca by Campbell River</b>. There were 2 big males. He had heard they were Northbound by Cape Mudge around <b>10am and at 12:40 pm</b> they were around the Browns Bay area looking like they were chasing seals. His call came in as he was watching the Orca breaching and spy hopping as we spoke between <b>6:50 and 7 pm</b>. They did not have a direction in mind, but seemed to be milling about.

We have water frontage in Saltair, BC (about 20 miles <b>south of Nanaimo</b>). Our location is approximately 123-46-12 lat by 48-57-48 Long. My husband spotted unusual activity outside. Around <b>5 PM</b>, our son yelled "<b>Orcas</b>!"  A pod of about <b>7 members</b> were about 100 feet off our beach in we figure about 20 feet of water. We assume that there were three adults to young whales (one to be the male, much larger than the others). They occasionally slapped the water with their flukes. They moved southward towards Chemainus.

We saw the <b>T124s </b>on Saturday also, but with a different male.
<br/>Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
In <b>Boundary Pass</b> the whales I saw were <b>T12A, the T124As and the T109As.</b>  The T109As I had seen on Sept. 2, 2011 off the Victoria waterfront and at that time there were 3 members of that group. Today, March 17th, there was an additional young whale, <b>a baby</b>, still with yellowish tinge, just not a brand new baby.  I think that T109A had her third offspring, sometime after 9/2/11. Both of these encounters were while on Maya's Westside Charters.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
As we were scanning Boundary Pass, we got a call that <b>a group of Transients were just below Pender Island</b>, so off we went. Soon we could see a group of what appeared to be <b>8-9 Transient Orcas!</b>  They must have just made a kill as there were lots of seagulls around, and the whales were milling about and playing a bit. So we dropped the hydrophone just on the off-chance they might vocalize a bit. And <b>the vocals were stunning</b>. So many whistles and clicks, almost Resident-orca-ish! Lots of surface percussive behavior. Then the lone big male (that was later ID'd by Dave Ellifritt from the Center as <b>T12A</b>) had a huge breach!  His huge pectoral fins and wavy dorsal fins were very reminiscent of a certain J Pod whale. We continued to watch these very active whales continue east towards Monarch Head and wondered who they were. Turns out they were the <b>T109As and the T124As</b>. After rounding Monarch Head, they proceeded into the bay behind it (which I've rarely seen whales do). Soon they were passing by us and heading East, so we continued back towards the islands. Lots of harbor seals enjoying the full-on sunshine, as well as about 7 Stellar Sea Lions on Greenpoint.

These whales included  the male <b>CA217 </b>("Chopfin"), who has a very damaged dorsal fin (entanglement injury, then propeller wound). This matriline is the<b> CA216s</b> - the same matriline that Ken Balcomb, Mark Malleson and others saw on the ACS Conference Whalewatch trip on November 12 2010 off of Monterey, CA.

Dick Snowberger, Sandra Pollard and I were about a mile southeast of <b>Camano Head</b> in flat calm water, about 8-10 miles from Naval Station Everett, at N48 03.127 W122 20.779 in their boat to record sonars and document gray whales. At <b>1430 </b>we heard the first pings and began recording on video tape. At first they were at low volume, but they ramped up within a few minutes to very loud. At 1440 we saw<b> a gray whale</b> moving southeast about a mile north of us. We watched as the whale approached the <b>Tulalip</b> shoreline and continued south. At 1525 we moved about a mile east, toward the whale. <b>At 1540 the whale began moving north at a rapid pace</b>. At 1607 we were at N48 04.260 W122 18.895, less than a half mile from shore. There may have been two gray whales within a mile of us at that point.
<br/>The sonars were repeated about every 13 seconds, with two bursts of pings for about 6-8 seconds, then about 4-5 seconds of silence before the next pings. With the hydrophone amplifier turned to the lowest possible volume the pings were extremely loud. I shot video, mainly for the sound but with a few glimpses of whales, and Sandra and Dick were shooting ID shots.

I found <b>J Pod</b> after a lot of searching at the mouth of<b> Porlier Pass</b> in rough seas. They were entering <b>Georgia Strait </b>and I left them pointed for Bowen Island.

Off <b>Clover Point (Victoria)</b> at <b>2:18 pm</b> saw a pod of what I assume were <b>transients </b>traveling about 3 miles to the east off Clover Point. There was a group of 5 harbour seals taking shelter along the rocks keeping a wide eye.

Just wanted to let you know that late this afternoon, there were <b>4 Orca in the Port Angeles Harbor</b>. They were out in the middle and it was so rough out, that a picture opportunity was not to be had. There was an adult male and 2 female and a baby/juvinile. I was so excited to see them even though it was short lived and not the best viewing..  :)

<b>08:01 PM PST -</b> Large number of <b>Orca</b> are passing through on the inside waters (near <b>Powell River, BC</b>) again, but no word on the Pacific White Sided Dolphins. Sightings reports are few, but at least there are sightings.

<b>20+ Transient Orca</b>, possibly the same ones from yesterday's report by Seymour Narrows, were at the<b> top of Johnstone Strait</b> this morning. If they are the same ones, they must have turned and were headed Southward past Orca Lab in Blackney Pass around <b>7am</b>.

Just got a report from my friend Josh Duncan on the Western King (commercial fishing vessel) that he saw <b>13 Orca heading just north of Seymour Narrows</b> (Campbell River area) in a northerly direction. He said there were 3 large fins in the pod. I asked if he took photos and if he noticed any notches in the dorsals but no reply yet. <b>130 pm</b> (He didn't take any photos, and didn't notice any notches. No additional information to this posting time. Susan)
