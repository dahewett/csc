Here is a photo taken 2-28-19 of <b>grey whale divots on the beach on the east side of Holmes Harbor</b>, 1/2 mile north of Beverly Beach. This is the earliest in the year we have seen signs of grey whale feeding. -Photo by Bruce Schwager, Feb 28, 2019 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thu Feb 28 - <b>Grays have been spread out between Hat Island and Snohomish Delta</b> all day today. With the flat calm water I can clearly see the blows and surfacing from my house near Howarth Park. -Ryley Fee

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:00 - Another gray </b>in the same area<b> SE of Hat</b> this morning...Lori Christopher.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thu Feb 28 - My husband took this video at <b>Dash Point park</b>. (Not state park) and it appears to be a baby grey whale or humpback whale. Can you confirm? (INSTAGRAM VIDEO of gray whale going under Dash Point Pier). -Thanks, Melissa Harrington

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:15 - A gray whale</b> swam right under my feet at the <b>dash Point pier</b>... I was told you would be interested... it was about 15 feet offshore in just about 10 ft of water heading toward the lighthouse (Browns) from the Dash Point pier. -Tim Valdez 
<br/>(<i>"This individual does not match any of the known IDed grays that are currently in the sound (49, 53, 185, 2246)".  -Alie Perez, Cascadia Research</i>)

Thu Feb 28 - Whale close in shore, north end <b>Lummi Bay off Sandy Point</b>, Ferndale, Whatcom County. -Tara Palmerton-Jacola Facebook Video on Sandy Point Watch FB page
<br/>(<i>unconfirmed but probably a gray - alb</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Thu Feb 28 - <b>08:00 - </b>I saw what looked like a whale spouting off of <b>Ruston Way in Tacoma</b> this morning at 8:00am, but wasn't able to stay long enough to see anything more...I only saw the spout, but it was a lot smaller than what I've seen in the past -- only about 2-4 feet high, so I was unsure. I didn't see anything other than that, but it definitely looked like a whale spouting. -Melissa McCleery Brewster
<br/>(<i>possibly the gray who was filmed in afternoon off Dash Point - alb</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 
 
PORPOISE - Thu Feb 28 -<b> ~16:20 - </b>While on the ferry from <b>Clinton to Mukilteo </b>I spotted <b>at least 2 Harbor porpoise </b>swimming eastbound in glassy seas several hundred feet from shore as we neared Mukilteo. I then drove over to Edgewater Beach park (east of the new ferry terminal under construction) in hopes of seeing grays in the distance, no luck, but saw porpoise again swimming around off the beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

Wed Feb 27 - (We arrived at Deception Pass bridge  ~ 15:30, we could see no orcas to the east or west. We then searched from beaches along west Whidbey beginning at Deception's West Beach and ending at Swan Town during daylight hours and in excellent viewing conditions with no luck.  Having arrived after Amy's 14:20 sighting we presume pod headed west towards the San Juans and was just out of sight ahead of our arrival - alb)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~2:20 - Last sighting</b> through binocs <b>2:20PM- hugged Deception Island then continued south/southwest</b>.
<br/>1:00 - BWs southbound - guessing Ts (turned out to be <b>members of L pod</b> -alb) - estimating 6/7 in pod -At<b> Washington Park</b> - 1 PM - slightly SE - could be headed under Deception Pass bridge?! ...so tough to tell (if a calf with group) - females/youngins stayed offshore and way ahead of the two HUGE bulls...definitely a good 4-5 females/kids ahead of these guys...They went west <b>through Guemes Channel</b> and played <b>in front of the Anacortes Ferry Terminal </b>before hugging WA Park...They first caught my eye from afar when they were romping around - breaching and tail slapping - <b>just to the east of - but close to - the ferry landing</b> in Ship Harbor before heading west and hugging the park. Still in shock. Wish I had better footage of the others for you! Other people from Anacortes are saying there were around 10 of them. Sounds like they were<b> first spotted on the west side of Lummi</b>, south of Lummi rocks at<b> 10:30AM this morning</b>. See Facebook Video. -Amy Eberling

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Feb 27 - <b>15:58 - There are at least 4 Grey whales off the east side of Hat Island</b>.

<b>09:09 - Orca off whiffin spit east Sooke</b> side heading for possesion point east right now!...could only see a few from the house...to rough out to investigate further... Likely T's almost came into harbour but were tight to shore line heading out and than east. -Paul Pudwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Tue Feb 26 - Thanks for all the great information. Just this morning we spotted at least <b>4 different gray whales in Snohomish River delta</b>. My daughter took some pictures with her telescopic lens (see Spring Freeman photos below). When we first noticed them, they were spread out over the entire delta. They traveled south and west to deeper water. Again thanks for the info....
<br/>Original email: My wife and I have been watching a whale or two all winter long south of Tulalip Reservation between Everett and Hat island. We're pretty sure they are not Orcas. Grays fed here in the spring. Just wondering if you could shed some light on the species and why they're here. Thanks for any info. -Jim Quintel

Sat Feb 23 ...As "Orcinus" putted out of the harbor, "Sea Lion" was seen nearing Kellett Bluff and Ken was also out in "Tonto". "Orcinus" headed southwest out of Mitchell Bay to try to find the group Jeanne had seen. Jane called on the radio to report that the three whales who had passed her place were the<b> J19s and that was who was probably near Kellett Bluff</b>. After about 20 minutes of searching, Dave finally saw his first whale mid-strait off Mitchell Bay. This was <b>J39</b> who foraged a little before passing the boat and continuing north...

HUMPBACK WHALES - Fri Feb 22 - <b>10:30 -</b> Hi. Just wanted to let you know, Believe I saw a <b>humpback</b> this morning (Friday 2/22) at 10:30 am from the Ferry Boat docked on the <b>northend of Vashon Island.</b> Whale came right up to the stern of the ferry while docked and we got a good view of its side. Unfortunately it moved away quickly and was out of range before I could get my phone to take any pictures. Watched it head south a little ways toward Dolphin Point before the boat left....I have seen greys and humpbacks, in canada, California and baja - so I felt like I just knew.. but thanks for asking for clarification... I saw a dorsal when it was diving (saw it dive twice)...Kevin Kim-Murphy

A <b>humpback whale</b> who has been spending time traveling up and down Puget Sound the past few weeks is seen here paralleling the shore while heading northbound towards the jetty at the <b>north end Marina Beach Park, Edmonds</b>. -Photo by Rosa Duarte, Feb 21

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Thu Feb 21 - (<i>The dorsal of this whale matches the <b>humpback whale</b> who has been traveling Puget Sound since at least late January who does not raise it's fluke when sounding. We'll refer to her/him as <b>PS Mn Unknown 2019 #1</b> until we have match or other ID# designation - alb</i>)  
<br/><b>18:30 - </b>Michelle Goll and I decided to carpool north and waited at Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach in hopes the <b>humpback</b> would arrive before dark. The sunset was remarkable, the sky and water painted in pinks, oranges, golds...shimmering and glittery. Around <b>18:00</b>, with much narrower swath of colored light beaming across the Sound, I spotted an <b>exhalation and the head of the humpback</b> to the south, traveling towards us hugging the shoreline. I observed two more surfaces. We waited anticipating the humpback would be visible as s/he continued and hoped for a surface in what remained of the light on the water, but s/he may have gone on a long dive because it was in near total darkness when we heard the whale blow directly out from our position at the southern end of the beach and we could just make out aher/his shape while gliding through the water. We walked along with the whale as she surfaced 2 more that we could hear but not see, and then one more last surface approx 6:30, again audible and this time visible...we both caught a visual of the black shape of her/his low arch as s/he slipped under water on her/his way north. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>~ 17:20 -</b> David Freed reported seeing <b>a whale between Mukilteo and Edmonds</b> from the train at approx 5:20. 
<br/>(<i>Upon further discussion David said he did not have a noticeable dorsal, but looked like he saw a row of nubbies along it's back. We presume he saw the humpback who would have been right in this very area at this time, but leaving open possibility there was another whale -alb</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>16:00 -16:35 -</b> I relocated to <b>Edmonds Marina Beach</b> could see whale blows just to the south approaching the dog park area, but a bit farther offshore than s/he had been when passing Shoreline &amp; Woodway. The <b>humpback</b> continued <b>steady northbound</b> passing in front of us and manybeach goers, same pattern leading with rostrum, pushing water, shallow surfaces and low arch when sounding on longer dive. S/he rounded the jetty at north end of the park about 16:10. I then relocated to just south of the ferry dock and watched the humpback keep steady northbound clearing the <b>Edmonds Ferry dock </b>(just ahead of the incoming ferry) around 16:20 still northbound at steady pace. I then relocated further north off Ocean Ave, pulled up and saw the whale slightly south of me, just north of and outside the <b>Edmonds Dive Park</b> keeping steady pace. Stayed long enough to watch a few surface intervals in glassy calm seas and left her/him heading towards Possession Sound to the north of us approximately 16:30-16:35. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Rostrum and dorsal of <b>humpback as s/he surfaces off Edmonds Marina Beach</b>. -Photos by Janine Harles, Feb 21, 2019 
   
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:15 - 15:45 - </b>After waiting for about an hour down on shore at<b> Richmond Beach Saltwater park</b>, I finally caught a glimpse of the <b>humpback</b> to the south of the point between <b>Carkeek</b> and my location, this was approximately 15:15.  The humpback continued in a line which looked as though s/he may be heading more offshore. A few minutes later (same as in Komo 4 video) a group of sea lions started porpoising along near the whale!  What I know of this whale is s/he likes to hug the shore so I was hopeful s/he would round the point following the shoreline. Several minutes passed when about 15:25 I saw a large disturbance in the south end of the slight bay, the humpback was ~100 feet offshore. S/he continued surfacing in regular intervals, pushing the water with her/his rostrum while barely surfacing, but at times showing a little dorsal. On 4-5th surface a more pronounced arch (though not as pronounced as what I've typically observed in most humpbacks when sounding). Dozens of happy humans lined the beach on this gorgeous sunny day watching this humpback pass by very close to shore. I ran to keep up with the whale who was passing the north end of the park by 15:30 holding steady swift pace towards Woodway inshore. Sweet whale! (Very brief FB Video)
I then moved to <b>Kayu Kayu Ac</b> park, further north in Shoreline and immediately spotted the humpback just offshore. I watched her/him surface several times and disappear around the dock at Point Wells, Woodway now on her/his way to Edmonds, time approx 15:45. The humpback did not raise her/his fluke during either of these passes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:51 - </b>Saw from land; just south of <b>Discovery Park</b>. Always a special event. Did not have my binoculars though!! -Deborah B. Cushing

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:45 - Humpback.</b>..from <b>Discovery Point Lighthouse</b>...maybe 30-40ft (from shore). Lost sight of it after it went around the point, then saw intermittent blows off <b>Golden Gardens</b> (judging that far away though was hard). Probably stayed more middle channel or east of mid channel NB. -Brittany Noelle Philbin

<b>13:40 -</b> Air4 is running out of fuel. We have to leave. Last location (of humpback), northbound at Discovery Park, moving at a quick pace.
<br/><b>13:26 - Humpback.</b> Just west of <b>Magnolia</b>...moving very fast northbound...Getting close to Discovery Park.
<br/><b>13:19 - Humpback.</b> Right now...it is northbound, rounding <b>Magnolia</b>.
<br/><b>12:49 -</b> Air4 reports spotting the whale (humpback -alb) near <b>Alki Point</b>. -Brian At Komo
<br/>(<i>Aerial video: Komo News 4 website OR Komo News 4 Facebook. Near the end, at approx. 40 minutes in, you will see a group of <b>sea lions swim and porpoise along with the humpback</b>!</i>)  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:45 - </b>Just watched a whale swim north very close to the <b>Lincoln Park shoreline in West Seattle</b>, 11:45am. Humpback? -Mike Yov

GRAY WHALES - Thu Feb 21 -<b> ~12:55 - Gray sighted off Mukilteo ferry dock </b>about 12:55 heading north...It was a ways off Mukilteo just when the boat left and was headed toward Everett. Since there was quite a bit of distance, it is possible it was not a gray, but certainly was not an orca. Pretty cool about the humpback; we've seen a number of them near Johnstone Straits and Queen Charlotte Sound. -Sue Ellen White

<b>Gray off Cooper Pt</b> this morning feeding on the bottom. east side of Cooper Pt. -Photos by Chris Hamilton, Feb 21, 2019 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>09:43 - </b>I just saw it (<b>gray whale</b>) 4 more times.  On the east side of spot itself heading south and then north of it mid channel.
<br/><b>08:45 - Gray whale</b> at tip of <b>Cooper Point on Budd Inlet </b>side. Traveling back and forth. Two surfaces and then a long dive. Watched 8 of these series. Was very close to shore and one time it looked like it was trying to feed. I have now lost it in the hot morning sun on the water. -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">February 20</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>10:30 - Humpback whale</b> spotted in the <b>Port Gardner area between Jetty Island and the Everett waterfront</b> today at approx 10:30 am. It made 2 passes, north to south, breached 4 times, and was last seen heading south and back out to Possession Sound....It looked like a hump/bump on it's back when it was out of the water - very clear for all of us to see as it was within 30 feet of us. It wasn't fully out of the water, we could see about 2/3 of it, but it seemed to throw itself into a low arc and rolled it's body while going back under water. -Cat Levitsis

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Feb 20 - <b>07:04 - humpback</b> moving north at a fast pace past <b>Richmond Beach Saltwater Park</b>. About 20 yards from shore, right through a group of sea lions! Sorry, wasn't quick enough to snap any pics. -Anastasia Nicolov

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

DOLPHINS - Wed Feb 20 - <b>10:49 - (bottlenose dolphin) </b>It stopped and milling around. I got a couple long range shots of the fin I'll post soon and maybe someone can help identify the species

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Mon  Feb 18 - At <b>1323</b>, a whale watching boat reported that they had found members of J<b> pod near East Point, Saturna Island</b>. Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1415 aboard "Orcinus". At 1454, "Orcinus" arrived on scene with the <b>J16s about three-quarters of a mile west of the Patos Island lighthouse. J16, J36, and J42</b> were traveling east tight together. <b>J26</b> was paralleling them a few hundred yards to the north and swam over to join them soon after...At <b>1618</b>, the J16s joined the <b>J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s</b> and they all turned south toward <b>President Channel</b>, though they seemed a bit indecisive about it at first. The encounter was ended at 1631 as the whales slowly swam south along the <b>Sucia Island</b> shoreline toward Present Channel. The <b>J17s and L87 were not present</b> during the encounter so the CWR will wait for another J pod encounter to confirm how J17 is faring. - Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 11.

UNCONFIRMED BALEEN WHALES (Humpback or Gray) - Mon Feb 18 - <b>Possession Sound - 15:45 -</b> Spotted from ferry to Mulkiteo from Clinton at 345pm today just north of Clinton ferry dock. Not sure what kind of whale, some saw large dorsal fin (like us) others also saw big tail dive down....Yes it was amazing to see as I held my two year old son. His first whale! My husband and I saw it from different spots on the ferry - he saw a tail from inside the ferry and thinks it was a gray or humpback. I however rushed outside with a group and saw a dorsal fin from the back of the ferry gliding through the water and disappearing - which I assumed was an orca but I didn't have my glasses on so it could have been a tail... - was hoping you might have other accounts to verify ... sorry we couldn't be of more help. It was very far away and very quick. -Sophie R Serrano

Sun Feb 17 - Elliott Bay - <b>17:00 - </b>I saw <b>a whale next to Coleman dock </b>at about 5pm on Monday, Feb 17th. I was on the Bainbridge Ferry and we were loading. It surfaced just north of us, about 50 yards from the dock. It didnt have a large dorsal and appeared to be about 20' long. Dark grey and few barnacles or discoloration on the fluke so I assume it was young. I've never seen a whale this deep in Elliott Bay. Is that odd?......Sadly no photos. I did shock another ferry rider, when I showed him. The whale was a very dark gray, had a very short fin on the back (not large dorsal), and had almost no barnacles which surprised me. I just figured it was very young. And I think a humpback because I didn't see ridges along the spine leading to the fluke. -Adam Nilsen

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:00 - Young grey whale at Colman Dock</b>...Not certain (gray). Seemed small and was whitish under the fluke. I only saw it briefly but my husband saw it all three times it surfaced. Very close to the docked ferry...No images. Husband said bit of bump when it surfaced. Then they made us leave the boat. Several people saw it. Sorry not a confirmed sighting. -Susan Smith Mitchell

Sun Feb 17 - Tacoma - <b>14:20 -</b> Hi there, sending over info about a whale sighting in <b>Commencement Bay in Tacoma</b>, just south of point Ruston. I was in the car and saw it come up and spout, just sort of appearing out of the water. Then a minute or so later saw a great big tail fin as it dove down heading towards point defiance/colvo's passage. No big dorsal fin. My best guess is that it was a minke. Just thought I'd share! (probable Gray) - Dan Wickens
<br/>&lt;(<i>Both gray whale and humpback were in this area and had some crossover in time -alb</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:00 -</b> I think I saw a grey whale off<b> Les Davis pier in Tacoma</b>, today at 2 pm....(direction) toward the port but i think it looped back. Also I guessed grey whale bc one was sighted further north recently. Could def be a different type. -Heide Fernandez-Llamazares

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:55 -</b> Looks like a humpback in the water by <b>Duke's in Tacoma</b>. It was hanging out near the shore - we didn't get a visual of its direction when it left. (Eating with one eye on water - must have missed it)...Got a clear view of the tail but no pics, unfortunately. Judgement was based on prior sightings of humpbacks and similarities but am by no means an expert. -Kate Kirby Boss

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Sat Feb 9 - Folks: Apparent Orca sighting today. I say <b>"apparent orca sighting"</b> because some of the dark shapes in the attached photos sure like orcas to me--despite the poor visibility. I was actually taking pictures of the snowy scenes on Vashon Island, directly across from my <b>West Seattle</b> home (approximately one-half mile south of Brace Point). I did not notice the "orcas" until I downloaded the frames to my computer and examined them more closely. The dark black "cone" in the lower center struck me immediately. If I am not mistaken that is an orca "sky-hopping". When I looked closer at other parts of the photo, I noticed another "orca" doing a back flop--right pectoral flipper spread wide. The other "orcas" are not so apparent, but would explain the abnormal coloration and disturbance of the water (all circled in red in the second photo). -Regards, Jim Nunn 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sat Feb 9 - I live in <b>Lantzville, BC [about 10 miles NW of Nanaimo in Georgia Strait]</b> and saw <b>3 or 4 orca</b> right across from me, on Maude Island (Winchelsea Islands) from approximately <b>1630 to about 1800 </b>(it got dark so couldn't see them anymore). I did not see saddle patches unfortunately. If the neighbour did get photos, I will ask her to forward to them me or to Orca Network. -Juli Wild

<br/><b>16:36 - </b>I've been hearing faint calls on and off on the SMRU <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone since 1540</b>. Hard to make out and still trying to figure out ecotype. -Kyla Graham

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:30-17:38 -</b> Guess what? They didn't go very far. They very faintly started over the <b>Lime Kiln HPs</b> at about 3:30...you can hear them a bit better right now. My guess is they have been down in the 'big water' all day...no telling what they will do next! Yes, J Pod!
<br/><b>03:15-06:00 -  RKWs on Lime Kiln</b>, distant at 3:15 a.m. By 6:00 a.m. it was <b>clearly J Pod</b>, and they were quite clear and loud over the Lime Kiln hydrophones. It will be interesting to see if/when they are located. Had they been north and came south? Had they been west and came in? Inquiring minds are so very curious to know!! -Jeanne Hyde

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Tues Feb 5 - <b>17:45 -</b> I could hear several <b>exhales to the north of Eagle Point</b> at 5:45pm. (Distant J pod calls were heard on LK hps at this time ,and through the day, but there was no visual confirmation on this group or Lodies morning group -alb)
<br/><b>09:00 -</b> Several <b>whales came by Eagle Cove</b> at 9:00AM this morning, they were very spread out, headed south, stalled for a while off of Granny's, did a little back and forth routine, then turned and headed north (out of our view) by 9:30. And poof...where did they go? I did not get photos. They were off shore, spread out, and directly in the glare of the sun so I can not confirm if Ts or Residents. -Lodie Budwill

<b>13:15 -</b> Burt Miller, MMO at WA State Ferries also reported this <b>humpback at 1:15 pm</b>, near Coleman Dock, within 15 - 20 yards of the floating dolphins at slip #3! It first headed south, then turned and headed north in <b>Elliott Bay</b>. Work was stopped on the Coleman Dock project while the whale was present, and they contacted the workers at Pier 62 to alert them of the whale's presence so they could stop work on their construction as well.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:00 - </b>Just saw something big just south of <b>Alki</b>, headed North. I'm guessing it was the <b>humpback</b>, but I'm new to whale watching.

<b>Humpback</b> was in area again today <b>08:15 at Owen</b>, closer to <b>08:55 at Tahlequah</b>. Seemed to follow ferry from Owens Beach to Tahlaquah terminal. Surfaced a half dozen times near the dock itself and along side ferry. Again hard to get any photos because I'm on duty. A number of commuters did see it. Sounds very little time on surface and lack of seeing the fluke during dives, makes it hard to identify. Seems small in size also. Thanks. The couple times I have seen it, it hasn't seen it's fluke, even on long dives. -Wayne McFarland, WSF

Admiralty Inlet - An amazing sighting. (originally reported as an orca)... upon further study of the whale sighting, I'm convinced it was <b>Humpback</b> based on the photos I've looked at. The small fin on the hump of its back was clearly noticeable...surfaced about 20 feet from the shoreline on <b>Admiralty Inlet</b> today at <b>4:30pm</b>. Our house is on <b>Keystone Avenue</b> about a mile south of the Coupeville ferry. It traveled north toward the ferry rolling and surfacing and spouting. There is a break in the driftwood barricade in front of the house. I just happened to be looking out and saw it surface at the opening. It was beautiful!  Couldn't catch a glimpse of any markings. Dark, shiny black. The sun was in the low western sky so I saw it spout numerous times up to Ebby's point. Then lost it in the sun, but I did see further spouting looking directly West close to Indian Island headed south about five minutes later.  Tall spouts. But couldn't get any identifiers. Did not report to Orca Network. Weren't we just talking about never having spotted one close in on Admiralty east side at yoga last week?!!!!  One in a million close up sightings for sure. -Leslie Warren

<b>13:50-13:55 -</b> Reporting: Today, Feb 2nd, around 1:50P to 1:55P at <b>Point No Point</b> (Hansville WA) 1/4 mile south of the Light House. Unreal, breath taking/stunning!!! - 30 to 50 meters directly out from me / directly across. <b>Four Orcas</b>!!! Trolling / feeding! The closet to the beach / me - Massive male via very high long dorsal fin - observed his distinctive white mark under massive dorsal fin many times as he trolled!! ...Afterwards I looked through online Orca Museum pics of the different male orcas - I'm 90% sure it was "J-27 Blackberry". However, I haven't found any solid pictures of "J-26 Mike" white marks under massive dorsal fin (found one, but it doesn't show much of his white / sense possibly much different than J-27 Blackberry). Also got a good view of one of the average size Orcas on the other side of the leader - guessing via pictures from Orca Museum either J-39 Mako or J-31 Tsuchi. Also read they are J-27 Blackberry siblings so was likely/possibly all three. The forth Orcas stayed underwater mostly/couldn't calculate size (and I primarily observing J-27 Blackberry as I was running - because he was right there ... 30 to 50 meters away with me all the way up the beach until we hit the Light house!!! Unreal moment!!!
After the four Orcas trolled up to the Light House closely to the beach they turned and went directly out into deeper water. Watched them for another 3 to 4 minutes until they disappeared into the Salish abyss!! Unfortunately no J-Pod photos...heard from local fisherman lots of local Black Mouth / Chinook hang off that point) - off Point No Point Lighthouse area. -Andrew Muehling

Sat Feb 2 - <b>09:50 - </b>Gray? Whale <b>Redondo</b>. Appears to be gray whale moving fast to south. Very close to shore, within 100 feet of shore, barely south of of boat ramp. Turned in towards shore south boardwalk appt half mile. I'm not terribly good at identification but certainly not an orca. It wend about mile south. Feeding close in shore. Whirling up water. Birds all around picking up scraps. Spouted several times but could only see its back. Not even tail. Big. I'd guess more than 20 feet long and quite big around. Wasn't really a hump that stuck out to me but as I said I'm no expert.  Hardly ever see orcas here. They favor Maury Is which is too far away to see. -Mark Eide
