 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Early this morning J and K pods met up on the west side of San Juan Island and headed north, up in to the Canadian Gulf Islands and through Active Pass. By the time we met up with them they were just exiting Active Pass, heading for the coal docks at Pt Roberts. J and K pods were together, resting at first. We stayed with them for a while and toward the end of our time with them they began waking and became more active. We also saw Canada Geese at Peapod Rocks, harbor seals, harbor porpoises in Georgia Strait, and an immature Bald Eagle. Island Adventures

So another pass by is in order before anything concrete is known about total ID's. We followed them all the way out to Race Rocks. Jodi Smith, Center for Whale Research/Orca Conservancy

<br/><b>Direction:</b>
<br/><b>Comments:</b> Hi Susan, I wanted to let you know that K and L pod returned yesterday! At 16:00 we heard squeals on the hydrophone in Andrews Bay. Rich said they sounded like K-pod calls. We went out and looked and saw at least 2 bulls so we know L-pod was there too. The Center was out in the boat so I'm sure they will have more details soon. I also heard whales on the hydrophone at 9:55 this morning but I didn't see anybody. I'll keep you posted. Rowann

<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	south 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> L-Pod was sighted about noon near East Point (Saturna Island) heading south through Boundary Pass. If J-Pod should resume its northerly course, the two pods may well meet up along the west side of San Juan island. High Spirits, the boat from the Center for Whale Research is at this time heading out from Snug Harbor to check on the status of L-Pod . Its a good time to look for Orcas on the live cam. Check back for updates. 2:10 pm Update. K-Pod has now been positively identified and is travelling with L-Pod. 2:44 pm Near Battleship Rock. I am with the whales at this time and it appears that all three pods may be coming together - if so I will try to film their greeting ceremony for OrcaCam.

<br/><b>Comments:</b> More details on Superpod Sunday (May 20th): Center for Whale Research staff have a few more details on who was at the "Superpod Sunday" off the west side of San Juan Island: J-Pod: all present L-Pod: Members of the L2's, L9's &amp; L35's (sub-pods of L-pod) were seen. The L25 sub-pod was not present (L pod is large &amp; the sub-pods don't always travel together). K-Pod: We're sad to report that K32, calf of K16, born between Nov. 4th &amp; 13th, 2000, was not present. But the GOOD news is that there was a new calf with K pod! K33, born to 14 year old K22 (Sekiu), is K22's first calf and the newest member to the Southern Resident community.

She looks amazingly healthy, considering the small tank she's been in over the last 30 years. But it was difficult to watch her perform tricks for food, &amp; to leave her there with no other orca company, knowing her family still swims wild &amp; free here in Puget Sound.

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Good morning! J's went by thru Hale's Passage this morning - about 7:45 a.m. reported off the ferry - they were heading north, traveling VERY slowly and tight - J1 and group of moms and calves it looked like - about 8 or 9 - looked like a very small one too! watched them all the way up the east side of Lummi and then they headed up north towards Pt. Roberts - i left them at about 9:45 a.m. and could still see them between Sandy Pt. and Matia Island. Very exciting for us here because they hardly ever go thru Hales Passage (E. side of Lummi) and it's fun for everyone to see them off the ferry! Where will they go next? Oh yes and there were NO boats (aside from the Whatcom Chief!) We watched from friends' decks - no acrobatics or gymnastics, (except an occasional lazy tail lob) My friend on the water over there said she thought she heard a seal making an awful commotion down by the shore just before they came thru...(?)

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Hi Susan! I was at the Center for Whale Research today. At around 1155 J's were going by. Spread out to 1 mile off shore heading south against the tide. Kelley is pretty sure he spotted J8 and J19 earlier. Inshore we saw the J16's, J14's, J11&amp; J31. The two sprouters, J27 and J26 were hanging offshore about 1/2mile together, rolling and being quite active. Right off the house I saw J22, J34 and J32! Kelley confirmed J32 so that's good news! All surfaced together and followed closely by J17. J17's oldest, J28, was baby-sitting J35, but only 25 yards from mom. J17 must be getting a well deserved break from child rearing because she did two cartwheels right off the "Balcomb Reef". That seemed to be the tailend and I watched those six group up and start to travel abreast past Bellevue Point at 1247. It was a great whale fix! --Jodi Smith
