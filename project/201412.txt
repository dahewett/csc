See  Southern Resident killer whale tagging. Map courtesy of Robin Baird, Cascadia Research.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 PM - Orcas at Burfoot Park</b>. We saw between<b> 6-8 orcas</b> at Burfoot park today! Beautiful, and so close! They seemed to be travelling south towards Olympia. -Kate Parker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:25pm - </b>Just saw a group of four off the south end of <b>Harstine</b> island headed south toward bud inlet. One male. Happy way to end the year! -Tom Yocum

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">December 30</font></b></center>
<br/>

Around <b>4-5 AM on the morning of December 30, J27</b> and presumably all or most of J pod ventured into the upper reaches of Eastsound, Orcas Island, for the first time in recent history. Later that day, just after 1 pm newborn <b>J50</b> was discovered about 32 miles away in Swanson Channel. Map courtesy of Robin Baird, Cascadia Research.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The Center for Whale Research has posted a detailed account of their encounter with<b> J pod</b>, including photos and the discovery of the <b>newborn calf, J50</b>: Encounter #76.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:55pm - Single male orca at Prevost Island</b>. On the ferry from <b>Swartz Bay to Mayne Island</b>, spotted a single (I think, never saw more than one at a time) male orca just south east of Prevost Island (Canadian Gulf Islands) between the ferry and the island. It looked small to me, but I wouldn't know as this was my first sighting ever! Definitely a male though, based on the very tall dorsal fin. Thanks so much for this website! Recent sightings in the area are what kept me motivated to stay out on the cold deck so long! He came up maybe 10 times and disappeared just as I pulled out my camera and just as my wife joined me! -Jeff Turner
<i>Note: The orca in this sighting was not identified.</i>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My name is Wayne Barnes &amp; am a wildlife photographer in <b>Tofino</b>. I came across a small pod o<b>f 4 Orcas</b>. It appeared to be 3 adult females with two calves.
<br/><i>Dave Ellifrit and Josh McInnes confirmed the ID on these orcas as Transient orcas <b>T68C's, T68C, C1 and C3</b></i>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Bob Lyden just posted: I just received a call from Joe in Thompson Cove (<b>south end of Anderson Island</b>) that there were about <b>Five (5) Orcas</b> in the Cove probably looking for sea lions <b>between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM</b> this morning and they left when some boats arrived. Joe said there was also approx. (4) Sea Lions hugging the shoreline at the same time, and he sees one out there now at 2:00 PM on this afternoon. so this probably is the same pod that has been around Anderson Island for the last seven (7) weeks. -Kelly Burns Keenan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Not sure of pod identification, but seeing <b>3 or 4 orcas heading north through Tacoma Narrows</b>. -Steve Finney

<b>J27's</b> movements through the Canadian Gulf Islands the day after he was tagged off<b> Bush Point, Admiralty Inlet, about 1 pm on December 28</b>. Map courtesy of Robin Baird, Cascadia Research

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

They continued south slowly down the shore, tail slapping buoys as they went by. I spent an hour watching these <b>orcas</b> pass very close to shore, a pod I have never seen before. It took me 3 hours to finally catch up to them, and just as I was about to head home and give up, this happened. It was a truly amazing day. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Taken at <b>Possession Point Park</b>, south tip of Whidbey Island. These are the <b>T137s</b>, thanks to Josh McInnes for the ID. One was tail slapping a buoy. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Video by  - Since mid-late November the<b> T137s</b> (mammal eaters) have been documented nearly everyday somewhere in the inland waters of Puget Sound, primarily roaming the inlets deep in the south Sound. Today came word of orcas <b>southbound in Saratoga Passage </b>in the north Sound. From the bluffs above Mukilteo Lighthouse park we spotted their blows as they neared the <b>Clinton Ferry terminal on Whidbey Island</b>. This video follows them southbound in Possession Sound until they reach Possession Point where they regrouped became very surface active, as if on a kill. Across on shore was a friend who was gifted with a very close up encounter. The pods approached within 100 feet of shore and she photographed one as it engaged in tail-lobbing a buoy. She was able to get IDable photos of at least one matriline, the others were not ID'd at this time. We followed the pod(s) southbound and ended in Shoreline watching the orcas pass the Kingston ferry terminal minutes before the sun nestled down for the night behind the Olympic Mountains. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The Victoria Clipper reports seeing <b>3 orcas in Possession Sound</b> headed north between <b>Camano Head and Sandy Point</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1232 - </b>above marina in <b>Langley</b>. Can see three orcas near Camano side. Lots of splashing. Appear to be eating. Not really moving. -Jennifer Thorn Scanlon

<br/><b>10:45 am</b> or so, saw one in or near<b> Elger Bay</b> moving fast going towards Langley. I am on my way to Langley. -Marilyn Armbruster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:am - at Long Point southeast of Coupeville</b>, we spotted from <b>six to eight Orcas within 150 yards </b>of the shore line.

<b>9:53 am - </b>Alleged small group of <b>orcas in Saratoga passage</b> just south of Penn Cove. I didn't see them but the wheelhouse slowed down for a second or two and said they were behind us. I missed them so can't say for sure who or give direction of travel. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Killer whale south bound southwest of Race Rocks</b>. I spotted a few killer whales (looked like transients) in less than ideal conditions near Race Rocks. Before I could confirm who they were they surfed off to the south and disappeared into the 6 foot seas. -Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Walking with some friends at the Heron Rocks campground (in <b>western Georgia Strait, between Nanaimo and Campbell River</b>), with hundreds of Stellers + California sealions on the rocks and in the water, off TOBY Island, there was a <b>SINGLE, YOUNG ORCA</b>, (2 years old?) swimming back and forth nearby, creating quite some commotion amongst the swimmers. Still, NONE took to the rocks. It all seemed strange to us. Could not detect any white marking on its smallish dorsal fin. -Jan Steen

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">December 28</font></b></center>

Our family headed out in the morning from Spencer's Landing, <b>Shoal Bay, north end of Lopez</b> for a day at Sucia. Before we even picked up speed our son-in-law Bill spotted an orca a ways off to port. (It was a little after 11:00 am.) We crept along for awhile and there turned out to be 2 of them - a male and either a female or juvenile.  (the male in the photo below is <b>J26 Mike</b>. This was the only report of any members of J pod Dec. 26) We were a mile or less north of Humphrey Head at that point. They surfaced several times.  The female stayed further away, but the male turned and eventually swam a short distance behind our boat. He had a very tall fin, and it looked wavy along the back edge. He surfaced a couple of time behind and to the side of the boat, (yes, our motor was off,) and then continued on his way and rejoined his partner. They were heading east, What a wonderful start to the day! We were on board Bill &amp; Carolyn McGown's boat the "Andiamo" with granddaughters Lucy and Phoebe.  Carolyn took these photos. -Susan and Mike Muckle

Santa brought me what I asked for, <b>Orcas in Penn Cove</b>! My first sighting there in the 3 years I've lived on the Cove! <b>Transients</b>....possibly some hunting behavior, changing direction, moving fast, then slow, birds following, then headed out to Saratoga Passage.

In <b>Harney Channel between Orcas and Shaw</b>, I was on the ferry home and we saw <b>orcas</b>. I thought the ferries probably reported these sightings.

It was a very interesting <b>audio encounter</b> last night. <b>Port Townsend HPs and repetitive call</b>. It began at least at <b>5:30pm</b> and possibly before - a repetitive call. The repetitive call came in 'groups'  - several, spaced out, and then nothing and then repeated again. The repetitive call and then finally distant J pod calls - which were less often -  continued for hours. At one point I thought I might have heard a <b>K Pod call or two</b> but I couldn't be sure.  <b>The rest I believe were J Pod</b>.  But who knows who the 'caller' was and what, if any, significance did that call have. At <b>9:14pm the last sequence of repetitive calls occurred</b>.  After that there were more J pod calls in the distance and the loudest, though still not loud, <b>J Pod calls came at 10:52pm</b>.  There were just a couple.  I didn't hear anything after that.  I posted clips of the repetitive call to my blog. -Jeanne Hyde, Blog:  Whale of A Purpose

Orcas at Anderson!</b>
WARNING: inappropriate words are used (the s-word) we are sorry but we were scared.
My buddies and I were crabbing off of the <b>west coast of Anderson Island</b> and even though we didn't really catch anything, we got to see the<b> pod of orcas </b>everyone has been talking about! We were in a little aluminum rowboat and we think that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the babies because right after we pulled up the pot the pod headed right for us. Most of the fun from this video comes from how scared we (really just me) were so some profanity is used. However feel free to laugh at how I respond to a scary situation like this (I yell run even though we are in a rowboat) and enjoy the beautiful orcas at the beautiful Anderson Island!

From KIRO TV: Wednesday morning two scuba divers shot video of<b> a gray whale in the South Sound</b>. They spotted it just feet off the shore of <b>Redondo Beach</b> (between Federal Way and Des Moines, southern Puget Sound).
<br/><i>It is not unusual for Gray whales to be seen in Puget Sound during the Gray whale migration seasons. We often hear about wandering Gray whales who don't know where the food is (unlike the 10 - 12 Northern Puget Sound Gray whales that arrive to Whidbey Island and Possession Sound each spring to feast on ghost shrimp). These wandering Grays are typically whales who are not in good health, and often end up dying somewhere in Puget Sound. </i>

There were so many people on the bridge and walking the beach at <b>Chambers Bay</b>. My 10 year old son &amp; I saw them w/ our binoculars. What a cool memory. It was our lucky day! We've been whale watching the past 3 weeks. It was so exciting to see them right off shore and right across the street from where we live. -Nancyann Boyle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

They put on a heck of a show between <b>Chambers Bay</b> and the houses on the tracks to the N. No one was watching at first but soon a crowd gathered in the back yards and from CB. At first I thought they might be hunting something but it looked more like play. Lots of white water and them circling, spouting and splashing. I was watching TV and spotted the spraying water out of the corner of my eye. My home sits about 180 feet above the beach on the east side of Fox Island and close to the steep bluff. They were straight across from my house about 1/2 mile away. I-phone cam was useless and my big camera had a dead battery! I watched them for about 30 minutes as they played and drifted N with the current right near the houses to the N of CB. Once people started to gather and watch they changed their behavior and settled down. The big male circled to the outside in deeper water keeping watch mostly but he could not resist to get in on some of the play for a minute or two and then went back to standing watch. They rested a bit after the hard playing and then the big male gathered them up and was steaming S in front of CB but heading for the deeper water. It is pretty shallow in that area but the tide was high. Once they hit the ledge where the Sound drops off deep between the east shore and the reef the dove deep and I never seen them again. Boats started moving south so I would say they were headed deeper into the south Sound. Lived here 21 years and only the 3rd time I have spotted Orcas from the house. Usually they are headed south and moving fast. Great to see them stop and play. Would have been awesome if they were on the this side of the narrows. 
<br/><b>2:33pm - </b>Spotted a pod just north of <b>Chambers Bay</b> close to the tracks in the shallows. Played for 30 minutes or more and last seen headed south in front of CB 30 minutes ago and dove into deeper water and never saw them again. 7 or 8 total one bull and a smaller male. -Tom Ferrari

Saw a bunch of splashing near <b>Nisqually Reach</b>. Turns out it was <b>Orcas "playing" with some poor seabird</b>. They kept jumping on it and hitting it with their flippers. These guys were not hungry. There were 15-20 stellar sea lions in the area that they totally ignored. They were doing this for fun. They would eat him and spit him out over and over. The bird lived though. Then one came up from out of nowhere and jumped out of the water right in front of me. Scared the crap out of me. Engine was off luckily. - Travis Harris

<b>Killer whales at Bush Point.</b> This is a few days late but wanted to report the sighting anyway. I had just seen a harbor seal and they surfaced exactly where he was. They did not appear to be hunting though. Two females traveled east along the beach to the white rock and then turned northwest towards Lagoon Point and I lost sight if them. It was a pretty stormy morning with a high tide, the water was rough and quite off colored. I fish this area a lot and was quite suprised to see them so close to shore. Amazing. -Ian Patterson
