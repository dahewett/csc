<b>April 30, 2011</b><br/><br/>



Finally found some <b>Transients </b>. They seemed to disappear for a few days but we found a group of about <b>15 </b>including <b>T37's, T65A and calves and T137A</b>. They were in the middle of the Strait of Georgia and were heading for the coal docks.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver


<br/>*<br/>


We got to see wonderful <b>Transient Orcas</b> this <b>afternoon</b>, north of Pt. Roberts, almost to Vancouver, BC. We didn't know they were out there until right before we left the dock at Snug Harbor Marina. It's a very long trip, but we had sunny skies, calm winds and a full boat.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA


<br/>*<br/> 


I was at <b>Lime Kiln Park (San Juan Island)</b> with my friend Melissa around <b>2:45 PM</b>. After watching the movement in the water it appeared to be a <b>Minke whale</b>.
<br/>Vicky Miller SSAMN Member


<br/>*<br/>


A few blows and a back of what appeared to be a <b>Humpback Whale</b> slowly moving in a Northerly / North-West direction in mid strait between Sliammon (just north of <b>Powell River</b>) and Harwood. I watched between <b>10 and 10:30 am</b> then spotted it again, a short distance North, close to Atrevida Reef around 11 am still continuing towards Lund / Savary.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, BC


<br/>*<br/>


Probable <b>Minke whale</b> spotted from <b>Lime Kiln</b> -- we watched it from <b>2-3 pm</b>. It was dark colored and we saw its small dorsal fin as it surfaced several times. Also saw a very large (possibly pregnant?) harbor seal hauled out on a rock, sunning herself. It was a good day for sun!
<br/>Kelly Howard


<br/>*<br/>


At <b>3:00 pm</b>, on Maya's Westside Charters, we met up with several <b>transient orcas</b> north of the <b>Coal Docks BC</b>, heading northwest. Shortly into the encounter they slowed down, split and each group attacked prey. The group we watched attacked a harbor seal.  Both groups seemed to move off at the same time, continuing to move northwest at a good speed.  I identified <b>T75B, T75B1, T75C, T36As, T65As and the T137s</b>.  I'll post pics on my blog. 
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


We were blessed with <b>Transients </b>(I think the T137's, T65A's, and T37's if I remember correctly...) in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b> heading toward the coal docks near Vancouver at approx. <b>13:00</b>. They were moving quickly north (with a couple occasional abrupt, milling halts) and were in two fairly tight groups when we saw them.
<br/>Katie Jones, Western Prince Naturalist


<br/>*<br/>


So, we finish the month as we started, with <b>transient orcas</b> cruising the waters usually patrolled by the residents. Today, a group of 10-12 transients was located in <b>Georgia Strait</b> at approximately <b>12:30</b>, about 3 nm north of Tumbo Island. They were traveling northwest, at a fairly fast rate of speed, sometimes porpoising. The group consisted of females, juveniles, calves and 1 sprouting male. We were able to identify some of them as the <b>T65A</b> group and the <b>T137's, T137A</b> being the sprouter. The orcas were traveling in two groups, with T137A and some juveniles lagging about 200 m/yards behind the moms, and engaging in a fair amount of social activity. At one point, the group stopped and was milling in one area for about 5 minutes, then continued on their speedy way. I've included a photo of a juvenile porpoising its way up the Strait (see photo above) - photo taken with zoom lens and cropped. We left the whales still heading north to northwest, west of the Tsawassen feryy terminal.
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch


<br/>*<br/>
<b>~11:40 am:</b> Just spotted what appeared to be two female <b>orcas </b>just east of tanker parked in the (Elliott) bay. I think there's a group just heading out of the bay, but I'm not 100% sure. They seem to be split into a group of 2 and one of 3, they appear to be heading towards Magnolia from what I can tell.
<br/>Katie Kirking 


<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:52 am</b>: Sighting off of pier 59 <b>seattle </b>right now!!! At least <b>5 orcas</b>, one big and one small, not traveling, just milling, SW of the ferry dock in Elliott Bay, Seattle. 
<br/>Jerry waugh/Roger Aaron
<br/>*<br/>
We heard tale of <b>transients </b>past East Point headed toward the <b>coal docks</b>.  The whales were still headed NW at a steady clip of 7-10 knots. Finally another boat came into view. Then we saw huge splashes. Finally we caught up to the pod, almost. They were cruising at about 10 knots. At first we could see what looked to be <b>5 or 6 dorsal fins</b>. Then, after a few good surfacings, the rest of the pod came into view. There were at least 10 whales swimming side by side and another 2 or 3 about 700 yards west of the main pod. We watched for about 20 minutes as the pods split and then fused again and again. There were at least two juveniles in the pod (one may have been more of a calf size).  The whales altered their course very little in the time we saw them.  They were cruising at the surface, taking big breaths.  We shut down the engines so we could listen to the exhalations. It was so calm and there was so little wind that we could hear them even from more than a couple hundred yards away.
<br/>Laura Swoyer, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris


<br/>*<br/>


We had <b>two Orcas</b> off <b>Depoe Bay, OR</b> today. No doubt there were more but only one very large male and another with a medium dorsal were spotted. I believe this is the third time in the last month we have seen them.

I just received third hand information that at approximately <b>11:30 AM</b> today there was a brief sighting of <b>4 orcas</b> close to Yaquina Head, just north of <b>Newport OR</b>. The observers said they were heading south and were out of sight within a short period of time.

<br/>*<br/> 


At <b>13:45</b> paddling from Rat Island toward town we encountered a <b>gray whale</b> heading northeast, it fluked and resurfaced West of us. Continued to see it until about <b>14:30</b>, it was swimming all around the bay, South to Kala Point, then popped up just a few feet off the NW Maritime Center Pier very near shore as we loaded our boats. Last sighting was headed East around Pt Hudson.
<br/>Sue Long, <b>Port Townsend</b>, WA


<br/>*<br/>


I got really lucky and witnessed 4 or 5 pairs of mother / calf Gray whale combos making their way north very close to shore from above (a pullout on Highway 1 about 400 feet above the ocean just south of <b>Grimes Point CA</b> - where there's a sea lion colony on the rocky beach at the base of the cliffs). The whales were in close enough to be able to see them underwater, so thought you might like to see the photos (see above photo of the day, and photo below), which were taken over the course of roughly one hour - <b>10:30am through 11:30am</b> or so. One interesting aspect to this is that at one stage, a Risso's dolphin (there was a small pod of them further offshore) came and swam between two whales (that looked to be about the same size - so not sure they were mother /calf), and both whales rolled on to their backs (see photo below), then rolled back on to their fronts again and carried on.
Most (if not all) of the combos turned around a couple of times and seemed to hang out in the kelp - rather than just constantly head north - I wondered if that meant they were hiding from predators or something, but I only saw the Risso's in the area, nothing more sinister. Is that normal behavior for the grays?

<br/>*<br/>


Connie Barrett of Camano Island called to report two <b>Gray whales</b> at <b>1:30 pm</b>, mid-channel in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, feeding 300 - 500 feet offshore of Cama Beach State Park. A group of people were on the point, watching from shore.


<br/><br/>
<b>April 28, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>


After receiving a call at about <b>4pm</b>, from Simon Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures out of <b>Cowichan Bay</b>, we headed up there on Maya's Westside Charters. There we encountered <b>T75B, T75B1 and T75C</b>. More of the encounter on my blog.  
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


We saw <b>two gray whales</b> in front of the house--north end of <b>Beverly Beach</b>--about <b>5:15this evening</b>. Neighbors to the south reported seeing three; they have a better view. Whales making their way north, feeding, blowing and rolling. 
<br/>Sally and Tom Cahill, Whidbey Island, WA


<br/>*<br/>


Chris Burt of Service Education and Adventure (SEA) called in from underway near the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton</b> ferry lane to say a <b>gray whale</b> rose and traveled near them heading north at <b>5:10 pm today</b>. The lat/long was 47 56 30N X -122 19 48W.


<br/>*<br/>


Saw the <b>Gray whale</b> from the <b>5:30</b> ferry - what an awesome blow!

Three <b>Orca whales</b> seen in <b>Harney Channel</b> (one large and two smaller dorsal), definately saw the white spots.  First seen on Shaw side and cross to the entrance of Grindstone Harbor heading west.  Spent a lot of time off Sweeney Cove. We first saw them around <b>6:00 PM till 6:30 PM</b>. We think they were playing.
<br/>Spence and Vicki Clark, <b>Orcas Island</b>, WA


<br/>*<br/> 


At <b>5pm</b>, on the Western Explorer we encountered<b> T75B, T75B1 and T75C</b> 
heading west isns in this same general area. 
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


I had <b>three transient orca</b> inside Deer Harbor this afternoon. Pretty rare to see orca so close to the marina but with transients, one never knows. I heard from Ivan on Western Prince they are the T-75's. They have been around the Wasp Islands part of <b>yesterday and all day today</b>.
<br/>Tom Averna, Deer Harbor Charters


<br/>*<br/> 


At least <b>3 orcas</b> between <b>Shaw and Lopez</b> at <b>8 this morning</b>. Heading north east.
<br/>Melisa Pinnow


<br/>*<br/>


At<b> 6 PM</b> there was a <b>Gray Whale</b> headed from <b>NW Langley</b> out toward Camano Head.  The whale came from the north and seemed to be headed in a southerly direction.
<br/>Veronica von Allworden, Langley, WA  


<br/>*<br/>


We watched a <b>Gray Whale</b> for over an hour as it fed immediately off East Beach County Park (<b>Marrowstone Island</b>). The tide was low enough so that we could walk out to the edge of the sand flat and take some photos and feel about as close to the whale as you can get without swimming.

<br/>*<br/>


We saw <b>3 or 4 orcas</b>, quite active,in the mouth of <b>Friday Harbor</b> just below the pt. to the east of of the marine lab on Monday as we came in on the ferry at about <b>3:30</b>. A friend coming in on the ferry from Lopez saw them again in the same place on Tuesday afternoon.
<br/>Kathryn Richter


<br/>*<br/>


We spotted <b>two large Orcas</b> ( at least - may have been four) at about <b>4.30pm</b> off Plettenburg Bay, Western Cape (<b>South Africa</b>). They were fairly close to shore swimming from Lookout Beach and round across Robberg. I think they were disturbed by motor boat and kyak at got close to them. They then moved out to sea. Just prior to spotting them there was a huge school of smaller dolphin moving in the same direction. I would love to know if a sighting in this area is unusual and if this pod was migratory.
<br/>Susan O'Keeffe


<br/>*<br/>


Just as we were admiring the wildlife of Spieden Island we heard talk of <b>orca </b>whales just outside of <b>Friday Harbor</b>. We said adios to the deer and took off in hot pursuit of the rumored whales.  Just north of the harbor entrance we saw blows in the distance. We could count three separate dorsal fins at the surface at the same time. We cruised slowly alongside and slightly behind the pod of transients for about fifteen minutes. They stayed fairly close to shore and kept a distance of several hundred yards, but even from a distance we could see that there was a calf present. 
<br/>Laura Swoyer, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris


<br/>*<br/>


On Maya's Westside Charters at about <b>4:00pm</b> we received a call of three <b>transient </b>orca spotted near <b>Pt. Caution</b>, coming up <b>San Juan Channel</b>. The three whales present were: <b>T75B, T75B1 and T75C</b>. These are the same whales who were at Anderson Island on the 24th. Later, from shore, I watched as they continued up San Juan Island, entering Spieden Channel, traveling west in mid-channel. I last saw them at 7:05pm angling toward Henry Island. T75B and T75C were seen on 4-15 swimming backward. Today they were swimming backward again, as witnessed  by me from shore and Ivan and Chris on the Western Explorer.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


Transients April 23 - 26 - Some IDs for the Puget Sound Transients: Thanks to some great ID photos sent to us by several of the folks lucky enough to see the pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> that has been hanging around <b>Puget Sound</b> the past weeks, we finally have IDs of several of the whales: <b>T75B and T75C</b> are there.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


Nice morning over here on the <b>Marrowstone side of Admiralty Inlet</b>. Finally saw a <b>Gray Whale</b>. Just after <b>7 a.m.</b> this morning as I was walking south from East Beach. The whale was feeding immediately off the cemetary, then moved south along where there is a nice long sand bar and eelgrass flats that forms north of Nodule Point. 
<br/>Ron Hirschi, Marrowstone Island, WA


<br/><br/>
<b>April 25, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>10am - 2.30pm</b> we had approx. 10 orcas off Cleland Island, NW of <b>Tofino, Vancouver Island, B.C.</b> We left them in a resting line, 3 miles offshore heading south east. No ID's.
<br/>Claire Mosley


<br/>*<br/>
<b>A Pod - Northern Residents</b>. Bill T. was walking his dog down close to the water around <b>10 pm</b> south of <b>Powell River</b> close to Myrtle Rocks when there were a number of blows. Since it was so dark and his dog was afraid of this unrecognized sound, he could not get closer for a count on the exact number of whales, but based on the reports, we can only assume it was the same pod known as the A5s. They were very slowly moving southward, almost drifting with the tide.
<br/>Susan MacKay Whales and Dolphins BC 


<br/>*<br/>


We had reports of J-pod out towards Victoria and heading West into the <b>Strait of Juan De Fuca</b>. Pretty soon the whales were up ahead. Somewhere between 10 and 14 members of <b>J-pod</b> was consistently swimming southwest with short down times. We watched for a few minutes when a few of them suddenly switched direction and became more active. A juvenile breached a few times, followed by others tail slapping and rolling on their sides. We watched the activity for about 30 minutes before we headed towards home.
<br/>Mike Oster, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching 


<br/>*<br/>


Nice to see the familiar fins of<b> J pod</b> again! We found them near <b>beaumont shoal</b> close to the <b>Victoria </b>waterfront. We spent time with J27 and a youngster, maybe J45, playing. There were a few others around the area too but couldn't get any ID's, water was a bit choppy.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver, B.C.
<br/>I can identify what I believe is T075C and T075B1 in these photos.
<br/>Graeme Ellis, DFO, Nanaimo, BC 


<br/>*<br/>


Tristen Maschneyer called with a report of <b>2 orcas</b> 3 miles out from <b>Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, CA</b>, heading east. He said both were males.


<br/>*<br/>
<b>Northern Residents - A5 pod</b> - Around <b>4:30 pm 8 or 9 Orca</b> spotted just past Dinner Rock (north of <b>Powell River</b> and just below Lund). They were resting on the surface then slowly moving southward and disappeared.

Orca off Annabon Island, Equatorial Guinea - off the coast of West Africa (-1.4050, 5.6131 - Gulf of Guinea, off the NW coast of Annabon Island, Equatorial Guinea). I was taking a boat tour around Annabon Island, when we spotted <b>three Orcas</b> north of our boat at <b>11 am</b> local time. We moved closer and followed them for 10 minutes. There appeared to be two adults and a juvenile. We turned back toward the island and saw <b>another large Orca</b> also swimming north. It was a real treat to see these whales on the Equator!

We spotted a pod of <b>orcas </b> about <b>10:00 a.m.</b> that swam north to south just off the west shore (about 60 yards) of Sinclair Island in the <b>San Juans</b>.  There were at least six, but difficult to count. They then circled for a long time off the north side of Cypress Island east of Towhead Island. In 30 years on Sinclair Island, we have never seen the whales come to that side of Rosario Strait.

Kim Allen called to report seeing four groups of <b>orcas </b>off Tide Pt, <b>Cypress Island</b> at <b>11:40 am</b>. They were heading south down Rosario Strait, close to Cypress Island.


<br/>*<br/>


Around <b>1:15pm</b>, my husband and I spotted an <b>Orca pod</b> between Lyle Point (Anderson Island) and the Green Marker at the mouth of the Nisqually River,<b> South Puget Sound</b>. We witnessed at least three adults and one calf. They were surrounding and herding a harbor seal I would assume in an attempt to teach the calf hunting skills. At times they would surface and appear to roll over onto the seal and submerge it as well as rolling to create a wake that would wash the seal around into the path of another pod member. In one instance three adult Orca surfaced simultaneously, forming a perfect triangle shaped corral around the seal then went back down again.  We watched them toy with the seal for at least an hour and a half. By the time we left the pod had moved closer to the mouth of Orro Bay (Anderson Island), in their pursuit of the seal, and had begun to breach the water and splash down near or on top of the seal, we couldn't tell which for sure. There did appear to be one Orca with a longer dorsal fin than the rest, a male I assume, and one calf about twice the size of a large porpoise. I also saw three large scar-like marks on the left side of the calf.

My wife and I observed a group of <b>3 orcas</b> in <b>south Puget Sound</b> at approx <b>1:45 p.m.</b> They appeared to be a transient group consisting of one adult female, one juvenile, and one other whale that was either a second adult female or possibly an older juvenile. The whales were ~ 1 mile SE of Johnson Point roughly mid-way between Johnson Point and Devil's Head.  We were motoring in our 32 ft sailboat at the time.  We stopped and the whales first swam towards us, then passed us and continued to the SE until out of sight.

Some members of<b> J pod</b> were located in <b>Georgia Strait</b>, heading East, at about <b>noon</b>. At first, only 3 whales were seen, and ID'ing them was difficult due to waves, and long dives. Eventually, more whales were sighted near the Pt Roberts lightstation, and we could finally confirm that it was J Pod. J34, Doublestuff, was observed lunging, presumably after a salmon. Then J28, Polaris, was seen milling, with little J46, Star, at her side. The whales were very spread out, from Pt Roberts, to north of the coal docks. They were working the tide lines, doing long dives, and apparently foraging. Some vocals  were heard on our hydrophones - such a sweet sound. Approximately 8-9 whales were seen, most too far away to ID.

We live on San Juan Island west coast between the two <b>hydrophones</b>, and HEARD a LOT of [<b>orcas</b>] passing by beginning at <b>9:45pm</b>. They seemed to be going north.

<b>Afternoon</b>, we saw <b>Orca </b>just off the mouth of Mayo Cove heading down (Southeast) Carr Inlet toward McNeil Island (<b>S. Puget Sound</b>). There were three adults and I believe there were two calves.  We live on the point between Mayo and Van Geldern coves and the Orca were 4-500 yards off shore. They were moving slowly and frequently surfacing until a Sheriff boat came roaring down Carr Inlet from the direction of Purdy, which caused the whales to dive.  The Sheriff boat did a U turn about where the Orca dove then backed off to the North and came down off a plane.  I believe the Sheriff boat deliberately "harassed" the Orca and definitely violated the exclusionary zone around the pod (as exhibited by the way the boat turned almost exactly where the whales last surfaced).
Several minutes after the Sheriff boat cleared the area, the Orca surfaced on the far side of Penrose point, and continued on toward McNeil Island.

Reports of <b>Orca </b>Southbound in Lewis Channel just below Teakerne Arm (<b>N. of Powell River, BC</b>) around <b>11am</b>. They slowly moved down the channel to just above the Copeland Islands, locally known as the Ragged Islands. The weather was almost summer-like, and flat calm water to boot! The Campbell River Whale Watching tour caught up with them around <b>12:30 pm</b> between Kinghorn and Mink Islands in Desolation Sound. There were <b>10 or more animals</b> in the group which were probably the <b>Transients </b>that had been working their way down Johnstone Strait April 21st. Later in the afternoon, the whales headed Northward up Waddington Channel and were last seen around Church House on Stuart Island just below the Yuculta Rapids.

A group of <b>transient orcas</b> was located at around <b>noon </b>in <b>Georgia Strait</b>, in the middle, west of Deltaport. The group consisted of the <b>T36A's, T123's, and T137's</b>. Initially, they were doing the typical transient travel - 5 minutes underwater, followed by about 5 breaths, and repeat. As the group traveled northwest, they came upon a California sea lion. The attack was immediate, with the females and even the juveniles getting in on the act. While the moms were doing all the work, T123A breached 3 times some distance away from the sea lion, then proceeded to perform tail waves. As it turned out, his anticipation of a warm lunch was not to be, as the sneaky sea lion managed to get away. The whales passed by the area where the sea lion had last been, but after a short time, they turned away and continued to the northwest. T123A and T137A were very chummy, swimming seperately from the mom &amp; kids group, and doing alot of rolling around together.

We got a little side-tracked by the sighting of a <b>Gray whale</b>. It caught our attention about <b>12:45 </b>just north of <b>Langley</b>.  A couple on the beach saw it breach and therefore had the honor of ringing the bell. We hurried up the beach towards the sandy point and watched as it continued to spout, the whale swimming in the same general vicinity. As we neared the little sandy point he had moved east past us towards downtown Langley. He crossed over towards <b>Camano </b>and moved around out there about the time the parade made it's way down to the waterfront. Once the welcoming ceremony was over and folks dispersed, we spotted it again NW of Langley heading east. The whale continued heading east towards and nearing Camano head. About <b>3:15</b> was the last time we saw it surface. A most beautiful and perfect Welcome the Whales day.

We live on the bluff on <b>Fox Spit</b> and were blessed by that wonderful swoosh sound this morning about <b>10:00am</b> as we were tending to our garden. We looked over the bluff and saw one Gray coming  South towards Eastpoint. All at once 3 more surfaced! They were obviously feeding (rolling and circling) and stayed around for about 2 hours. I got a few pictures of the largest one as it passed by our house and will send them to you in a following email. He looked to be 35-40 feet long. Much larger than the other 3 which parted from the large guy and headed back North.  As he headed towards East Point he traveled about 60 feet from the shoreline.

We didn't stay with them too long as they began to mill about heading west.  I matched the ID I took with a photo from 6/25/10. I believe this is a sprouting male who associates with the CA122s.

<b>2 or more Transient Orca</b> spotted right out in front of the <b>Powell River</b> Ferry terminal at <b>8:20 am</b>. I picked them up continuing on a slow roll towards Grief Point.

This morning somewhere around <b>7:30 am</b>, 6 for sure maybe as much as 10 <b>orcas </b>going east to west between <b>Eagle island and Anderson island</b> (47.11'12 N; 122 4.58 W) in Balch Passage, last seen closer to Longbranch. One good size male, could have been as many as 3 juveniles, another 3- 4 mid sized ones. Rather a leisurely swim, rolling - sometimes upside down - actually 3 were just stationary for a few minutes, just floating - took them about 15-20 minutes to swim through the area when first spotted at Eagle island to Otso point, then didn't see them for a long time until they surfaced closer to Longbranch.

A magical 4th Annual <b>Quileute </b>Tribal School Whale Welcoming Ceremony today at <b>La Push</b>. The sun broke through at the river mouth as the children danced, the drummers drummed, and songs were sung to honor and welcome the "brothers of the sea".  The tide was out, the bay was flat calm...no sign of whales. The Whale Callers, in stunning regalia, assembled at the water's edge. Two boys entered the water and bare-chested pulled the little raft with cedar boughs and a fresh salmon out past all the little breakers, a food offering for the whales. The boys swam back to shore. No whales. The ancient whale calling ceremony concluded, and participants came up from the beach to rejoin the crowd. Many eyes still hopefully scanned the horizon one more time. And then they were spotted: <b>a parade of orcas moving north</b> outside the bay. Some people saw five or six at a time, some thought they saw twice that number. An elder was heard to say "I guess the Whale Callers did their job!"

We left that group and started heading home when we saw splashing in the the distance and as we got closer we could see breaching, tail slaps, spy hops so we were convinced it was residents but as we approached, we realized after seeing <b>T87 </b>that it was a large, active group of <b>T's</b>!

Report of 6 [<b>orcas</b>] near the beach at Point White on <b>Bainbridge Island</b> is VERY interesting.  When I was a kid we lived just north of Point White.  There were rubbing rocks at Point White [about 300 yards north of the point] where orcas came in to rub.  My dad saw them doing this as early as 1907 and I saw them as a kid in the 1950's.

<b>4:19</b> Broomgerrie Beach on <b>Bainbridge Island</b>. Alerted by neighbors Ben &amp; Nadine Benson that there was a pod of <b>Orcas </b>near our house. There seemed to be 6. They were breaching, lob-tailing, changing directions and enjoying swimming towards Elliot Bay.

Powell River/Sunshine Coast, BC reports from Whales &amp; Dolphins of BC: <b>4 Orca</b> spotted by Grief Point, <b>Powell River</b>. They appeared to be in stealth mode, disappearing for long periods of time. They were close in to shore heading towards Beach Gardens Marina. One larger male and one juvenile in the mix. I watched to see if they'd come closer to Westview, but nothing till too dark. Since we've had around the same number for the past few days in the area, they may be Transient (meat eating) Killer Whales that have found a food source too good to leave.
<br/>A FB friend, Laila, gave me this site after seeing a couple photo's I took of <b>3 Orca's</b> while at the Beachgarden's in <b>Powell River</b> today. They were heading south. I think I may have seen the big male you mentioned. He is huge. From Wendy P.

On the Western Prince at about <b>1:30 pm</b> we encountered many transient orcas attacking a Steller sea lion just south of <b>Patos Island lighthouse</b>. <b>T36 </b> and a couple juveniles were off, while others were in the fray just a few hundred yards to west. 
The whales identified were members of the <b>T36s, T99s, T65As, and T123s</b>. The largest male, among all of these whales, was a sprouter T123A.  It appeared to be a training session with groups taking turns attacking the sea lion.  When we left the scene the Steller sea lion was still alive.  About two miles away and approaching the general area of the whales and the sea lion, were more whales.  Identified in this group were <b>T101, T101A, T101B and T102</b>.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island


<br/>*<br/>


We had managed to discover approximately <b>15+ Transients </b>1.5 miles SW of the <b>Patos lighthouse</b> and they were in definite hunting mode. The focus of all this attention was a Steller Sea Lion. He spent much of his time vertical with his head down to help him see the attacks coming, but with so many orcas, he wasn't winning the battle. The whales would act like they were leaving, only to suddenly turn back and take turns hitting the Steller. Even the younger calves got in on the action. Lots of lunges, a few breach-like aerial assaults. It was like an episode of Wild Kingdom. After an hour, we began to leave, only to discover yet <b>another group of Transients</b>!  They weren't part of the hunting group, and instead were about 3/4 of a mile west of the group, kind of hanging out.  As if they could hear all the amazing vocalizations and knew what was going on, but weren't invited to the "party."

At <b>12:05 pm</b> I looked out our office/sunroom window to see a [<b>gray whale</b>] spout in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, between Elger Bay and East Pt. At <b>1 pm</b>, the whale was just off East Pt, continuing south mid-channel.
At around <b>5:10 pm</b> I saw three spouts in Saratoga Passage, mid-channel between Camano Island and the entrance to Holmes Harbor, moving closer to Camano. By 5:30 pm, one of the whales had headed N toward Elger Bay, and the other two appeared to be continuing south. Though we typically have only adult Grays in Saratoga Passage, one of the spouts did appear much smaller than the other two.

We observed a lone <b>gray whale</b> at <b>11:35</b> in the north west part of <b>Port Ludlow Bay</b> about 100 yards offshore just adjacent the Admiralty Condominiums. It was hard to judge its size but probably 30 - 35 foot. This was right at a -2.0' low tide and we estimate it was swimming in 40-50 foot of water. Begining location estimated to be 47°-55'-28.0"N &amp; 122°-40'-46"W traveling slowly to the NW.  It surfaced every 4 - 6 minutes, blowing 3 - 4 times before diving. It appeared to be probably feeding. Unable to get good visuals on markings except for one more prominent light patch (not nearly as large as Patch's [#49] and further forward) on its upper left side below the dorsal hump and a white/light marking on the tip of the right fluke. It was exhibiting very leisurely feeding/surfacing activity and only on the final dive of each sequence were the knuckles and flukes even partially visible. In a little over an hour we observed the whale travel NW for about 0.75 - 1.0 miles and then return about 0.5 miles slightly further offshore, apparently milling around.

We finally found <b>Transients </b>hanging out southeast of <b>Hein Bank</b>. And it was so amazing. Two family groups, the <b>T49As</b> and the <b>T49Bs</b> were traveling together, and they seemed to be almost out for a "casual swim".  Normally with Transients we'll see 3-4 quick surfacings and then down for a long interval up to 6 minutes.  Well, these guys would come to the surface very leisurely about 8-9 times, then go down for 4 minutes, and repeat.  They were highly non-directional, one minute popping up 400 yards away and moving away from us, and then they'd turn underwater and show up passing our stern. For a lot of the trip, we were shut down so we could listen to their blows and discuss Transients vs. Residents, life histories, and more. It was such an amazing encounter that we were sad to have to end the trip.

I found the <b>T049A's and B's with T075B and T075B1</b> southeast of <b>Hein Bank</b> early this <b>afternoon </b>after following up Jeanne Hyde's shore sighting in the morning. They tracked to <b>Eastern Bank</b> where  they then split up into two groups and each group killed a harbor seal.

<b>7:45 a.m. transient calls</b> began coming over the <b>OrcaSound</b> hydrophones (NW San Juan Island) and then later over the Lime Kiln Hydrophones. I spotted whales on the far side of <b>Haro Strait</b>, closer to Vancouver Island side at about <b>8:30a.m.</b> They continued south and then turned east toward San Juan Island, turning south again at about mid-strait. They continued in a down island manner until they again moved over closer to San Juan Island. I last saw them at <b>10:30a.m.</b>, some close to shore, less than 1/2 mile south of Pile Pt. and another group off shore, heading away from the island.
On Maya's Westside Charters in the <b>afternoon</b>, we found, who I believe were the <b>same transients</b> that I saw in the morning.  This time we encountered them in the area of Eastern Bank.  There were a total of 9 whales:  <b>T49As, T49Bs, T75Bs, and T75C.</b>  We left them in the same area spread out and they appeared to be socializing. During our time there we did not see any clear signs of any kills being made.

Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research arrived on scene just north of East Point (48° 47.08 N; 123° 02.51 W) at <b>12:15 p.m</b>. The <b>transients</b>, who had been traveling north into the southern <b>Strait of Georgia</b>, had just turned around and came charging back out of the tide rip and began some intense milling around Rosenfeld Rock which had 30-40 Steller sea lions on it. There were thousands of Bonaparte's gulls working the tide rips. The whales briefly harassed one sea lion but apparently let it go. A couple whales continued to cruise around the rock while the rest of the whales on the calm side of the tide rip milled around the area in a social kind of way. There was another group of about 10 T's in the area but were on the rough side of the tide rip so we did not make it to them. We ended the encounter at 48° 47.23Np; 123° 02.37 W, around <b>1:30 p.m.</b>as the whales turned north again into the sloppy waters of Georgia Strait. The whales photographed by CWR: <b>T36, T36A, T36A1, T36B, T36B1, T37, T99, T99A, T99B, T99C, T124, T124D, T124E, T137, T137A, and T137B</b>. Sixteen whales total.

April 15 - 17 - We had <b>Orcas </b>travelling through <b>Sansum Narrows</b> for 3 days in a row: April 15, 16 and 17, 2011. I wrote you about the amazing encounter with 31 Transients who stayed in our area for at least 7-8 hours Friday. (Graeme Ellis identified them). Saturday I did not go out to see them. Sunday afternoon between <b>2 - 4 PM</b> I went out in the whaler with 2 young friends from Victoria, and we watched a small group (probably 8) feed in Sansum Narrows. Every encounter is amazing! I took lots of photos and will burn a CD for Graeme Ellis so he can identify them. Simon Pidcock thought they were 49A's and B's and one other. They MUST have been feeding as they were here for over 2 hours, but again, I never saw a kill or evidence of a seal being eaten. However the gulls were flocking over certain areas and seemed to be picking up bits of meat, so who knows? I have seen the whales so rarely the past 2 decades here in Sansum Narrows that I am not trained to identify the whales nor be an accurate judge of their behaviour!

Approximately <b>12-15 orca</b> were at the mouth of <b>Fulford Harbour</b>.

They arrived at around <b>7:15 am </b>and left around <b>8:00 am.</b> They came into the bay on the west side of <b>Russell Island</b> went further into the bay and went out on the east side of Russell. They are currently headed southeast. I live on the west side of the bay across from Russell Island on Roland Road. I am checking whether I can spot them way out between Pender and us, but I haven't seen them yet. They may go around the point toward Active Pass or? 8:41 am: I just spotted them out in the channel between <b>Pender and Salt Spring</b>. They seem to be south of Beaver Point on Salt Spring.

<b>6.00 pm</b> - my almost apoplectic with excitement mother, Doreen Semmens, called from <b>Ladysmith, Vancouver Island</b>, to report seeing '...<b>orcas </b>popping up off Transfer Beach all over the place in groups of twos and threes...' from the comfort of home.  No time to get down to the beach to take photos in case they disappeared (which they did while I was talking to you). They headed in the direction of Coffin Point, and seems you already had this unusual event of a 'transient superpod' logged with researchers on the scene.  Mum had a great Happy Hour!

Whales were spotted at <b>Cattle Pass </b>at about <b>9 a.m.</b>  The whales were the<b> T49As, T49Bs, T75Bs and T75C (Transient orcas)</b>. Throughout the day they traveled up <b>San Juan Channel</b> - the first 2 hours they were feeding on what I believe was a Steller sea lion kill, based on the length of time and the amount of birds that stayed with the whales looking for scraps.  At <b>noon </b>on the Western Prince the whales were still south of Friday Harbor and one whale did a very unusual thing, and repeated it several times. 
The whale was swimming backwards! 


<br/>*<br/>


At about <b>5:30 pm</b> on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the same whales as they made a kill in <b>President Channel</b>, along the northwest side of Orcas Island. When we left they were still heading north.

This was the most stupendous day in my life at Bold Bluff! My neighbour across the <b>(Sansum) Narrows</b> phoned to say the whales were coming past my home shortly before <b>10AM</b>, so I grabbed my camera and life jacket and dashed out in the whaler with Daisy, my dog. I followed two orcas for an hour. One had a tall wobbly dorsal fin and the other a small one - probably a male and female. Often they dove and rose together, as if in a ballet. I followed them for an hour, all the way to <b>Cherry Point at Cowichan Bay</b> and left them there, heading south.
On my way back up Sansum Narrows right at Burial Island to my amazement I saw gigantic splashes and action - wow! A big gathering of more <b>orcas </b>where the seals haul out. There were whales everywhere: spy-hopping, jumping, slapping their tails and flippers, dashing here and there crossing over each other and having a grand time. It seemed like there were a lot of babies! I had not a clue whom I was watching, (but I knew I could find out later by phoning you!) My memory card ran out just when I reached the scene of action, so I zoomed home to fetch another card, and my two pruners who were working in the orchard. It didn't take much to convince them to join me in my big boat.
Wow! Is all we could say. The whales were super active, and it FELT as if they were chasing food but we never witnessed their surfacing with a big morsel in their mouths. Altogether I stayed out with the whales for 3 and a half hours. Once they surrounded my boat, circling around me (I had taken my pruners back to work!) and I got nervous. Were they asking me to leave? Were they curious? Was there a poor seal hiding out beneath my boat? Two Steller Sea Lions looked very scared. They were heading towards shore with their heads high out of the ocean, looking back towards the whales.
Brr! I was COLD! So back at home with a cup of hot tea, I phoned you to ask if anyone had reported the whales and knew who they were. Thank you for getting to Ken Balcomb and John Ford! Graeme Ellis and John came down from Nanaimo, and Simon Pidcock came out from Cowichan Bay. Graeme indentified them as <b>Transients</b>, and I am sure he will send you a report of exactly who was playing in the Narrows for so long. Simon stopped by this evening and said he saw a huge carcass on the surface - a sea lion, so they WERE dining! I got some superb photos, too! What a blessing to be living at Bold Bluff, with a good neighbour who phones to let me know the whales are here. I was just heading out the back door to clean the Garden Cottage with a bucket of rags when she phoned. I would have missed the entire show if Joan hadn't called at the precise time she did.

While pruning fruit trees on a historic property at <b>Bold Bluff, Sansum Narrows</b>, between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island, we were called out to get in the boat and witness a rare sight, brought to the property owner's attention by a phone call from a  neighbour who lives in the Narrows. The orcas had been feeding since daybreak and it was now 11:30 am. Dozens and dozens of orca were feeding in the vicinity of Burial Isl, both to the distant south and east and west in the narrow channel. It is unclear how many were present, though 50 or more was guessed. They would surface in groups of 3, 5, 7  and more, individually or in pairs. There were babies and good old boys. They exhibited every orca behaviour I've ever heard of, repeatedly, both near and far. They were very tactile with each other, seeming to mount each others backs. After feeding, they seemed to get very playful. The numbers of whales and the level of activity was extroadinary. I will never forget this experience.

<br/>*<br/>


We saw at least <b>6 Orcas</b> by <b>Lopez Island</b>, coming up <b>San Juan Channel</b> with the flooding tide, starting at about <b>12:20pm</b>. They were in 2 groups appearing to be feeding as many gulls were with them for leftovers. It looked like 2 families, 2 adult females with their offspring. Able to indentify T-049B with her 5 year old calf T049B1, and it looked like she had a new calf- we could see the yellow tint of the little calf's' white eye patches and chin!
They all joined up and swam toward Shaw Island, stopping, lunging and circling as if hunting, then spy hopping at Thatcher Pass, as if deciding which channel to take. They continued up San Juan Channel, crossing over toward San Juan Island and began to hunt again with circling, direction changes, and tails hanging above the water.
We went to see Yellow Island and Steller Sea Lions on Spieden Island and as we headed back to Friday Harbor, going between Orcas and Jones Island at about 3pm, there the Killer Whales were again!, families hunting and traveling. We also saw Harbor Seals on the rocks, Bald Eagles, Rhinoceros Auklets, Murres, and Cormorants. A delightful trip!

It was about five miles w of <b>Moss Landing CA</b>. We were with the <b>orcas </b>for several hours - observed a rather speedy sea lion kill by the males.

After the report of <b>5 to 6 Orca</b> coming in my direction yesterday around <b>12:30 pm</b>, I quickly got a few things organized and headed out to find them with a neighbour. We spotted them rounding Grief Point and were surprised to see so many blows. There were around 16 of them spread out from <b>Texada Island</b> to the mainland.
With them being so spread out, it was quite difficult to figure out who they were other than <b>Transient Orca</b>. Dropped the hydrophone in and not a peep. At least at the start. Later on they became quite vocal - a typical Transient Orca trait. Paced one group, at a safe distance - all boats are required to keep their distance - close to <b>Harwood Island</b> in front of Powell River. The other group with one or two males continued up towards Atrevida Reef area.
The group we were with had two calves, one of which was having a great time porpoising clear out of the water. They continued to breach, roll around, tail lob and spy hop. Lots of missed photos - if only they'd be more co-operative. Having stopped the skiff and drifting, it was wonderful that they came over to investigate even surprising us by surfacing right beside the boat. Although we didn't see them actually take any porpoises or sea lions, one photo looks like there is something in one whale's mouth.

We saw at least <b>9 killer whales</b> zig-zagging their way east at 44/00 in <b>Monterey bay</b>. I believe there were at least 3 males present. Once, the whales popped up about half a mile from us and it looked like they had been harassing <b>a single gray whale</b> since the whale was in defense-mode belly-up. The gray didn't appear full grown, possibly a juvenile. The orcas seemed to lose interest and continued east. The gray whale was left looking dazed and confused-- swimming slowly at the surface and taking shallow breaths.

Orca Network and the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network received a call late Saturday afternoon with a report of a <b>dead Gray whale</b> found on a remote <b>Whidbey Island Beach</b>. The whale was very emaciated, and not one of our North Puget Sound population of 10 - 12 Grays that stay in the area for several months each spring to feed on the ghost shrimp beds of Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound. Howard Garrett and Matt Klope of the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network responded on Sunday, and a necropsy was performed Tuesday by a team from Cascadia Research and CPSMMSN. No food was found in the whale's stomach or intestines, samples were taken and will be submitted for further testing to try to determine cause of death, but it is likely this is just one of the whales that didn't get enough food last season and was not strong enough to make the long migration down south and back north.

Where, [most/all] of its head and much of its body surfaced out of the water, as it passed by. Sure, makes a difference when you see them, in ultra calm waters. And, when gray is so close to the beach and shoreline [50 to 75] feet out or so. Evidently, gray did not have much appetite for sand/ghost shrimp. After two brief beneaths the water surface/swirling stops, it went out to deeper water. Just south of the pilings to the Cove marina entrance.

We located a group of <b>transient orcas</b> in <b>Swanson Channel, south of Active Pass</b> at approximately <b>12:30</b>, in flat calm water. The group had killed a seal or two just prior to our arrival. They were busily guarding the entrails of their prey from swooping seagulls as we came on scene. The group consisted of females, juveniles and calves that we later ID'ed as the <b>T36's, T37 and the T99's</b>. After their meal, the whales were very social, and we were able to listen to some amazing vocals that continued for most of our encounter. The adults T36, T36B, T37 and T99 were observed logging at the surface several times, while the calves and juveniles were extremely social with one another, and about 100 metres from the dozing adults. Between these episodes, the calves would temporarily rejoin with the adults before once again forming into a play group. We were fortunate to observe spyhops, lunges, tail slaps, and tail stands. So much for serious, quiet transients. I love it when the whales have me re-thinking all those generalizations.

Turns out we had a report of <b>orcas </b>in <b>Haro Strait</b>, so we motored over towards Discovery Island (near Victoria, BC) and we were very lucky to have a chance to see the <b>T20s, T49As and T49Bs</b>. They were being a bit "un-transient like" in their behavior today.  Lots of surface time, logging, and generally just "hanging out". Then down for 5-7 minutes, only to reappear in a random location (very transient like!)  Even from 300 yards away, the whales were impressive, especially T20 and his massive notched fin. The whales appeared content to just "mosey" at a leisurely pace.

John Boyd called about two groups of <b>transients </b>near <b>Discovery Island</b>, east of Victoria, at <b>1 pm</b>.


<br/>*<br/>
<b>4 orcas</b> reported from <b>Port Townsend/Keystone ferry at 11:35 am</b>, closer to PT side, but heading NE toward Whidbey, reported by David Gluckman - likely the Transients that have been in Puget Sound.

Here at <b>Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Island)</b>. We observed short snack of <b>2 grays</b>, right out front at <b>1:30PM</b> today. 4 sailboats were on their line from a distance, so they headed out a ways and meandered southwest, towards Polnell Pt. Put my beach pedestrian shoes on to follow. About 1/4 mile down they stopped  and hung out in same place, [300 to 500 feet off sand shoreline] for close to an hour. It was low tide with sand out a ways. Am persuaded they were feeding in deeper water/not shallow; at a drop off where sand ends and ledge to deep water begins. More like a baleen whale would do, coming straight up after being down for 5 minutes or more. Both side by side when surfacing. Witnessed, this about 5 years ago when two gray whales near Polnell Pt. were doing the same. Was out in the boat, at that time and could see tons of stick or kneedle fish in the water, as the whales were feeding. Their spouts today, seemed to be louder than the norm. Really, blasting away in the calm waters. Left them, but at 3:30PM they both came back out front the house, to finish their snack, they had started at 1:30. When sailboats were around. Grays visit ended with them steaming their way towards Polnell Pt. Was treated to lots of diving, rolls, with tails/flukes throughout the afternoon. Great Stuff!!

About <b>1 PM</b> spotted one, possibly 2, <b>Gray whales</b> feeding in front of our house south of <b>Mabana</b>. They were out quite a ways and diving deep in about the same place for about half and hour, presumably feeding.

We visited with (<b>Gray whales) #56 and #723</b> off of <b>Camano Island</b> as two bald eagles soared overhead! They surfaced several times giving us some amazing looks with the island in the background. We spent a lot of time with them and as they got into deeper water, they showed us their flukes a number of times!

Paula Rounds reported <b>1 Gray whale</b> off <b>Polnell Pt, NE Whidbey Island</b>, traveling east at <b>noon </b>today.


<br/>*<br/>


We spotted <b>one gray whale</b> feeding near <b>Spee-bi-dah</b>. We first spotted the gray at <b>8:25am</b> and watched it travel slowly along the shore, leisurely feeding and churning the water. It went out towards the point, then came back in towards Spee-bi-dah.  Around 10:00am we lost sight of him. While watching for blows about then, we spotted a group of porpoises, traveling swiftly north about 1/4 to 1/2 mile off shore in front of Tulalip Shores. They swam along in twos or fours, and then many of them came together at once - perhaps as many as 2 dozen.  They separated again and swam further north, again in groups of twos or fours.  The porpoises were gray with a dark blunt dorsal fin (harbor porpoise.)

I looked out the window at <b>4:50 pm</b> hoping to see a Gray whale (still), and instead saw 3 - 4 Harbor porpoise off Hidden Beach, N. Greenbank, swimming north in Saratoga Passage (again). But somehow missed seeing the Grays that I KNOW were out there somewhere!

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research tagged along aboard the Western Prince after Captain Ivan saw some whales from the ferry just outside of <b>Friday Harbor</b> in the early evening. We found the whales with the help of Jeannie Hyde around <b>1845 </b>just NW of <b>Yellow Island</b> (approximately 48 36.73N 123 03.44W). The whales were the <b>T49As and T49Bs</b>, six whales in all. They moved northwest slowly in a tight group, barely showing any saddle. Present were <b>T49A, T49A1, T49B, T49B1</b>, and the two newish calves <b>T49A3 and T49B2</b>. T49A2 was not there and it is unclear as to whether this juvenile dispersed or died.

We got word of <b>Transient orcas</b> at the south end of <b>Saltspring Island</b> The group first appeared to be heading southeast, but what followed was only the first of many direction changes that we witnessed during our encounter. The travel pattern would have been best described as a series of large circles. At least one, if not several, seals lost out to these top ocean predators. We could see oil slicks on the water, and the gulls plus one bald eagle joined in for scraps. Following the meal there was some play time, and we were fortunate to see some spyhops, tail stands and even hear some of those eerily, amazing transient vocals. The whales that I could ID in the group were <b>T100, T100B, T100C,T100E, T90, T90B</b> and possibly newish <b>calf </b>with T90, <b>T124, T124D and T124E</b>. T100B appeared to be calf-sitting T100E for mom, while T100 worked on getting lunch. T90 appears to have a tag, very visible on her left side dorsal fin, and showing as a dark bump on her right side dorsal
