<h3><center>April 2003 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>April 30, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>9:15am</b>, Cliffside, Jpod heading west in Boundary Pass. Some were playing in the wake of a big ship.
<br/>Saturna Island
<br/>*<br/>
Mike Rivers, an Oregon Park Ranger, received an email report of 5 orcas in Budd Inlet at <b>8:40 pm</b>, saying they were very close to the Yacht Club. 
<br/>*<br/>
<i>Number of Animals Seen:</i>  5 or 6
<br/><i>Where:</i>  1 mile into the Henderson Inlet in Olympia, WA
<br/><i>What direction were they heading:</i>  as they left the inlet, they were heading West towards Boston Harbor
<br/><i>When:</i> April 30, 2003, 7:30 pm (approximately)
<br/><i>What were they doing?</i> We think they were eating. The sea lions in the area were up close to shore, we saw about 6 or 7 of them near the shallow waters in front of our house. We saw fins, blows, one whale breached the head and about half the body was out of the water.  
<br/><i>Were there any males?</i>  We think at least one or 2.
We have seen whales in this area before but it was 7 or 8 years ago.

<br/><br/>
<b>April 29, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
At about <b>8:00 this evening</b> orcas passed by Bush Point (west Whidbey), heading south. One large male close to shore and a few more farther out. At first I saw only one female farther out, but just after I finished calling in the sighting, I saw a couple more whales near her. And the male was quite separate. His dorsal fin was pretty wavy on the back side, from the brief look I had.
<br/>Elsa Leavitt, Bush Pt.
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
And Bonnie at the Bush Pt. Bed and Breakfast also called in a report of this pod at <b>8:05</b> - 1 male orca and ~6 others heading south, very close in - about 10' off the Bush Pt. dock.
<br/>*<br/>~~
Only out today in the am. Left Jpod going back S.E. at <b>1225</b> just west of Pile Pt. (Haro St.).
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
There's a gray whale off Langley right now (<b>7:30 p.m.</b>), heading toward Clinton.

<br/>*<br/>
Only out today in the am. Left Jpod going back S.E. at <b>1225</b> just west of Pile Pt. (Haro St.).
Had a great encounter with J2 once again, no, no breach but just sort of saying "Hi".
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
There's a gray whale off Langley (<b>7:30 p.m.</b>), heading toward Clinton.
<br/>Brian Lowey,
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen called to report that he and Dave Ellifrit were with J pod today, leaving them at <b>2:30</b> at Salmon Bank (s. end of San Juan Island). He said the whales then went through Cattle Pass and up to Friday Harbor.
<br/>*<br/>
...one adult male orca, two youngsters and at least two more...between Turn Island and Shaw Island in San Juan Channel. 
Time: <b>1520</b>
<br/>Nan Simpson
<br/>*<br/>
...a group of 5 orca very close to shore at North Beach (near Ft. Worden, Port Townsend) at <b>3:45</b> this afternoon. One very large male, two females and a third female with a calf were traveling towards Admiralty Inlet. We drove to Point Wilson and watched them awhile longer. After ten minutes or so they headed out a ways and appeared to be continuing to head into Puget Sound.      
<br/>Judy McCutchen
<br/>Port Townsend, WA
<br/>*<br/>
It's been a very long spell since we have seen any grays turn the corner and 
come into Port Susan.  Around noon today my husband and I both saw one, maybe 
two, grays traveling south right along the east coast of south Camano Island. 
<br/>Vicki Mattson
<br/>Tulalip Shores
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:00PM</b>. Just saw 2, maybe 3 grays spout out in front of the
house (SW Camano Island). The tide is in so they were reasonably close.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Three greys feeding <b>6:30-7:30</b> this morning in Langley heading up Saratoga Passage.

<br/><br/>
<b>April 28, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
...with Jpod for a short period this afternoon as they "woke up" they were all bunched up crossing Open bay towards Henry Is.
A few turned to the East, J1 turned to the West, the rest stopped and milled.
Then they all turned back South with breaching and a great show of exuberance.
<br/>
A gray whale off Victoria at <b>1630</b> going W.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
1 Gray whale was reported at <b>8:10 pm</b> just East of Polnell Pt, (NE Whidbey Island) heading easterly toward Coupeville, coming from the Mariner's Cove direction.
<br/>*<br/>
Whales came by the west side of San Juan Island heading south
between <b>7:30 and 8 AM</b>. They were really moving fast!
<br/>Helen King
<br/>Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Patrick of Bon Accord Charters called in a report of J pod off Lime Kiln Pt. at <b>1:45 pm</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research was able to ID one of the transients off S. Whidbey on 4/27/03 (many thanks to Mark Tavelli for sending us his photos):
<br/>The one female that there is a okay picture for, I believe is T122 who often hangs with the T46's.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
<br/>*<br/>
Time observed: <b>0800 to 1000</b>
<br/>Location: Mukilteo and Clinton ferry landing mid-channel
<br/>Number or Orcas: 6 to 10
<br/>Direction of travel: Observed over 2 hours in the same location
<br/>Interesting note: Orcas appeared to be training younger Orcas how to attack a sea lion
<br/>
My son and I observed a group of 6 to 10 Orcas mid-channel between Mukilteo and Clinton. The small pod had a large live sea lion surrounded and appeared to be working with their young Orcas possibly training to hunt and kill the very large sea lion.
<br/>
Observed the following:
<br/>The larger Orcas would strike the sea lion and completely knock the sea lion out of the water sometimes flipping the sea lion in the air end to end then simply swim away and let the younger Orcas work with the sea lion.
At times the Orcas would pull the sea lion under for 5 to 10 minutes then re-appear. The younger Orcas would jump on top or swim over the sea lion.
<br/>
The small pod had at least 2 or more fairly large males and 2 or more large female plus 2 or more younger and much smaller Orcas.
<br/>Rowann Tallmon
<br/>The Whale Museum
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Jack's whale watching out of Port Townsend reported 6 Transient orcas in Saratoga Passage at <b>1400</b> somewhere in the southern part of Saratoga Passage.
<br/>*<br/>
Cindy Hansen of Mosquito Fleet at <b>3:45 pm</b>: There are Transients (the T-46's) in Saratoga Passage - they were by the Mukilteo/Clinton Ferry earlier in the day eating sea lions, and at this time are near Madrona on Camano Island, heading toward the north end of Camano.
<br/>*<br/>
Then a 3rd message: There were orcas in Skagit Bay between <b>5 and 6 pm</b>, last seen at the buoy off Strawberry Pt, N. Whidbey Island, heading east toward LaConner. 
<br/>*<br/>
...off Lummi -along the west side from about <b>5:45 to 6:30 p.m</b>. - J pod passed traveling very quickly, porpoising, breaching, tail slapping, the works! AND we saw the new baby traveling with a very tight group of 7-8  - there was quite a bit of swimming upside down by a couple of the wee ones!
<br/>Penny Stone
<br/>Lummi Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 pm</b> - At least a dozen 50 feet off the beach, right out front, and another dozen or so out deeper. With a huge pink run in September, and a reasonable sockeye run this summer, we'll be seeing them alot.
<br/>The Willows Inn
<br/>Lummi Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
J Pod, south of Pt. Roberts, headed for Pt. Sandy, about
<b>4:30 PM</b>.

<br/><br/>
Jim Maya called at <b>6:45 pm</b> to report J pod at the south end of San Juan Island heading south, after spending the day going back and forth along the west side of San Juan Island. 
<br/>*<br/>
Jpod in the morning and afternoon at <b>1605</b>. J2 did a full breech 20 ft. off the bow. Just amazing to see the old girl do that (J2 is estimated to have been born in 1911! - sb).
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:00 AM</b> - Orcas on the west side of San Juan Is., just south of Lime Kiln Park, milling...
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:50 AM</b> - we received a call from Mary Pacher reporting 2 gray whales back feeding off North Bluff Rd/Hidden Beach, and heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
My son and I have been watching a gray off of Fox Spit (SE Whidbey Island) about <b>9:10 AM</b> when it went straight across toward Camano and joined up with another gray...
<br/>Bob &amp; Joshua Armbruster

<br/><br/>
The Greenbank Postmaster had orcas in front of their home (east side of Greenbank, Whidbey Island) on Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday mornings (4/25, 4/26, 4/27) - she said it looked like it was a pod of ~4.
<br/>*<br/>
Jpod in the afternoon in South Haro St.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
...around <b>12:00</b> I found T61(Victor) heading west out the Juan de Fuca within a half mile of East Sooke Park. He was moving at a good clip with the outgoing tide. There was an earlier report from a fisherman that there were a few transients off of Victoria waterfront. We did not find any others as they were probably out ahead of Victor.
<br/>Mark Malleson (Prince of Whales)
<br/>Victoria, BC
<br/>*<br/>
Whales by here on the west side of San Juan Island heading towards Lime Kiln Lighthouse about <b>5 PM</b>.
<br/>Helen King, Innkeeper
<br/>The Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
...about <b>4PM </b>... Cattle Point (So. end of San Juan Is.). They were
headed North... then suddenly they turned back South... then headed back
North again. Very spread out...  Maybe 2
miles between the first group and the last?  and some were way out in
Haro... none were close enough to shore really.  Though one male was in
kind of close... J1?  While up the West Side and all the way to
the County Park... when in the car I had 89.1 FM (live orca calls) on... never heard a call once.  Some echolocation but that was all.
<br/>Cher - San Juan
<br/>*<br/>
We had J-Pod today right in front of Anacortes at <b>1pm</b>. The pod was spread out in Rosario Strait and traveling south. As they turned around the corner of Lopez Island we were able to view most of the pod including, Ruffles, Granny, Blossom and her new calf J-39. Great to see both the old girl and the new sprout today!
<br/>Emily E. Bremer, Marine Naturalist
<br/>Island Adventures, Anacortes
<br/>*<br/>
Mary Pacher called again at <b>12:55</b> saying the 3 gray whales were still feeding off N. Bluff Rd, Hidden Beach area. At <b>1:3</b>0 she said they were heading south toward our place, so I went out and there they were, right below the bluff! We watched the whales feed from <b>1:30 - 4 pm</b>, busily feeding the whole time - can't wait to see the feeding pits at low tide. They just kept zigzagging back and forth, north &amp; south, east &amp; west, flopping around with flippers and flukes in the air - it was wonderful! I was able to identify one of them as "Patch", and one of the three seemed smaller.
<br/>Susan
<br/>*<br/>
The two whales are by Hidden Beach (~3 miles no. of Greenbank, E. Whidbey) -  <b>2:11pm</b>
<br/>*<br/>
Woody Harris called to report 2 adult grays &amp; 1 calf off North Bluff rd.(north of Greenbank, Whidbey Island) at <b>11:30 am</b>, heading west.
<br/>*<br/>
Mary &amp; Chuck Pacher called at <b>12:30</b> to report the same whales off North Bluff, ~3 miles north of Greenbank - she thought they were heading north, but then said it appears they're just feeding - I'm heading out to see if I can catch a glimpse!
<br/><br/>
<b>April 24, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
...transient T61 was off Victoria in the early am last reported near Sooke at <b>1030</b> going W.
<br/>
A single Minke East of Trial Is. (Oak Bay Flats). <b>1422 hr</b>.
Some Dall's in Haro St. morning and afternoon, just a cold and wet day.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
Received a call from Louise Salmin that she'd been watching 2 gray whales in mid-Saratoga Passage from <b>7 - 7:30 ish</b>. She'd watched them from up near the northern end &amp; when she called said they were headed toward East Pt (near the entrance to Holmes Harbor). We went out to the bluff &amp; found them at about <b>7:45</b> - they were closer to the Camano side, just south of Elger Bay, &amp; still heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:50 am</b> - Jim Anderst of Coupeville called to report a gray whale feeding just south of Snakelum Pt (near entrance to Penn Cove, east Whidbey Island), heading in a southerly direction. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 23, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
Two whales were seen from the <b>4:30</b> Mukilteo-Clinton ferry. They were first seen mid-channel, in deep water, right in the ferry traffic lanes. They were last sighted heading north towards Everett, heading closer to shoreline. They were blowing infrequently (we saw them surface only three times for the whole crossing), and seemed to be moving rather quickly. They were too far away for any identification.

<br/><br/>
We were with J Pod at <b>8 PM</b>, headed north past Lime Kiln State
Park/Andrews Bay, north west side, San Juan Island.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters
<br/>*<br/>
On board the Snow Goose, we watched what appeared to be a false killer whale in Bellingham bay for about 20 minutes today at about <b>10 a.m.</b>  It seemed to be staying close to a dragger (Larken). It surfaced five or six times, was 12 - 15 ft long and then followed the Larken as it headed out of the Bay. A real treat as we had 24 sixth graders from Blaine doing our school program.
<br/>Sue Webber
<br/>*<br/>
I just returned from flying over the whales! J-pod came by my place earlier (west San Juan Island), and I went up with a friend to see them from the air.  Pretty incredible looking down at them in the beautiful clear blue/green water. They were spread out along the west side of Henry Island with a few whale boats observing. It was about <b>2:30 PM</b>.
<br/>Helen King
<br/>Highland Inn of San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
The theodolite tracking crew had J pod spread out and foraging (lots of breaches) off South Beach at <b>0615</b> today. We followed them as they grouped up and moved north. They moved pretty fast with the current past the Lighthouse at around <b>0820</b>. Had some positive ids on J2, J8, J1, J16, and J26.

J pod is here again today, but you already know that. I first heard them at <b>0746</b> going north, they went up to Kellett Bluff and turned around and went south with the outgoing tide. They are probably off Eagle Point by now (<b>1330</b>).

Just got back from a great visit with the Orcas. We started about <b>10:30 am</b> and finished around <b>3:00 pm</b>. We first saw the whales off South Beach (south end of San Juan Island), followed them to Eagle Cove and then waited for them at Lime Kiln.

<b>7:30am</b>- J Pod is about mid - channel in front of Kens (Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island) going north. Hope they stick around again. There is evidence of a lot of fish and a lot of bait. If they don't have to travel so far this time of year to find enough food it sure helps their situation.

<br/><b>1215</b> 1 whale SE of Hat Island, appears to be ID#53
<br/><b>1355</b> 1 whale off the west side of Camano north of Camano Head headed north, appears to be whale #22
<br/><b>1435</b> 2 whales mid-Saratoga Passage headed south then turning and headed north more along the east side. Likely ID 49 (Patch) and likely # 21
<br/><b>1627</b> 1 whale (possibly #22 again) headed across from Camano State Park to East Point
<br/><b>1820</b> 1 whale which I did not get a good look at but which could have been #53 headed south quickly just north of Possession Pt.

We received a call from Larry Sevick from a boat off the coast of Washington - he reports seeing a pod of 12+ orcas 8 miles off the coast, north of Grays Harbor, April 18 at <b>7 pm</b>. He said the pod included at least 2 males, and it looked like their travel was trending northward.

Jpod in Haro St. all day. J1 was about 2.5 miles away from the rest and going N. this was just S. of Lime Kiln at <b>1455</b>. The calves look good. Another great Dall's show on the way home, they really look great this spring.

J Pod was off the west side of San Juan Island most of the day. They came in from South Rosario this morning about <b>10:30</b>. We spent about 2 hours with them south of the Cattle Pass Lighthouse. Both new calves look real good. I got some great photos and will put them up as soon as possible. Both calves were together when we were with them and appear to be good buddies. Lot of feeding activity so there must be a good number of fish in the area. They were going north the last I heard at about <b>4:30</b>. 
J 38 has a very distinct eye patch, I will try and isolate it in a photo.

We encountered J-Pod just south of Lime Kiln. As we watched Blossom and her brand new calf, J-39 (just 2 weeks old), swim past the bow of the boat she lifted the entire baby orca out of the water with her nose!!! We got a great look at the new baby's belly and I hope my photograph taken of this event may aid in determining the sex of the whale. Very exciting!

Robert Stonefelt called this morning to report 1 Gray Whale at <b>8:15 pm</b> at Mariner's Cove (NE of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) feeding &amp; heading south toward Polnell Pt &amp; Oak Harbor.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30 pm</b> Went out to the bluff to see if we could find the 3 grays reported by Barbara - and we found another Gray north of Cama Beach headed south toward Camano Island State Park. We saw the other 3 grays, though they were WAY on the other side, hugging the Camano shoreline. At about <b>5 pm</b>, just as they got close to Elger bay, they turned and headed south. When we left a little after 5, the single gray was nearing Camano Island State Park and still headed south.
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie, Greenbank
<br/>*<br/>
We talked to Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research while we were watching the grays, and they were watching &amp; listening to J pod as they headed south past the Center (~<b>4:45pm</b>)  
<br/>*<br/>
We found a group of transients milling off Stuart Island at about <b>11 a.m</b>.
They went down on a long dive, and J Pod came up where they had been. The
transients then went west across Haro Strait with the J's following
behind. At Mantare Island, the transients turned north, and the J's
continued to follow them. At Gooch, the transients turned west again, and
the J's continued to pursue them, with both groups porpoising, and the J's
slowly gaining on the transients. At the west end of Gooch, the
transients turned south briefly, but actually headed north. The J's
milled for a while where the transients made this move, then headed north
as well. At the north end of the group of little islands, the transients
headed west again. However, the J's continued north a little ways and
stopped to rest. We left the transients as the Annie Mae pulled up, and
from the radio chatter it sounded as though additional whales may have
joined them. The J's headed east after their nap, then turned south back
to Gooch, and then headed back to Stuart and on to San Juan Island, where
they passed Limekiln Lighthouse headed south from about 4:15-5:15.

T14 (04) transient, off Victoria going from west to east <b>most of the afternoon</b>, left him 5 miles S.S.E. of Hein Bank.
Had heard of the whales off Gooch Is. but my info was they were not J's but transients.
Started North for Dall's when reports came in of J's coming S. in Spieden Ch. and the Transients going N.E.
Meet Jpod in Andrews Bay very far apart but going S.
Never did see J1 or the new calves but only on scene for 15-20 min.

We live on the shore of Hood Canal at the mouth of Little Anderson Creek (halfway between Bangor and Seabeck). This morning we sighted an orca about 2/3 of the distance between us and Brinnon. The sighting came about in this fashion. My wife is a birder. She was scoping the birds in the canal at about <b>10:00 a.m.</b> and noticed a great activity of gulls. As she continued to observe, there was a large splash occurring every few minutes with the dorsal fin showing occasionally. My wife saw head and body. My son and I took binoculars and also observed the event. We interpreted the activity as being an orca feeding on a seal with the gulls attracted to the remnants. We continued to observe for about 30 minutes. We can testify to only one orca. The event occurred about 1 mile south of Oak Head on Toandos Peninsula.

... a single gray whale finning and feeding off the NW coast of Spee-bi-dah (north of Everett).  Blows were 45 seconds to one minute apart. I 
observed the whale from <b>10:30am until 1:00pm</b>, when it then headed back south, out of Port Susan.  I'm wondering if this was the same single gray that I witnessed swimming in Port Susan yesterday.

At <b>7:45 this morning</b>, Beatrice Morgan called with a live report of at least two gray whales in the shallow inner reaches of Penn Cove, near Monroe Landing, apparently feeding.

<b>April 1, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
At <b>0630</b> a large lone Gray was rolling and blowing in Penn Cove, Whidbey Island, near Hwy 20 where the mussel farm pier is located. It was high tide and
he/she was in no hurry!

Mike said that there was a grey out by the mussel rafts (in Penn Cove) this morning, but it headed back out at around <b>8:00</b>.

We had a grey whale in amongst the mussel rafts this morning and then again this afternoon.
<br/>- Ian.

Sitting here this morning (Tuesday @ <b>8:45 AM</b>) drinking coffee and watching one very large gray out front of Bells Beach, heading toward Fox spit about mid channel and two other small grays straight across close to Camano heading toward Langley direction. Anybody else out there get sighting of these guys? Hate to be the one and only.
