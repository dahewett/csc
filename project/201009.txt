<h3><center>September 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>September 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>3 pm</b> - John Fortin of Hansville saw <b>orcas </b>near <b>Double Bluff, SW Whidbey Island</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Lime Kiln</b>: Jeanne Hyde reports <b>L pod</b> calls at <b>20:21</b> on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>. First auto-detections were at 20:16, but calls became clear slightly later, listen here. Auto-detections continued at Lime Kiln until last one at 21:45. OrcaSound: First auto-detections were at at 20:30, slightly later than at Lime Kiln. Auto-detections continued at Orcasound until last one at <b>21:00</b>. At times there were many calls in each recording, click here to listen.
<br/>*<br/>
Did anyone report the dozen, or perhaps more, <b>Orcas </b>that were salmon feeding <b>12:30</b>, in <b>Georgia Strait</b>, Canadian waters between BC Ferry Tsawwassen dock &amp; Deltaport Way? (they have now!) There were no less than 5 commercial whale watching boats there to witness. It was very exciting. Thank you to the BC Ferry Captain who made the announcement so that anyone aboard could take in the experience. It was an amazing sight. Spread over a mile were many Orcas feeding. Three big males for sure. Spectacular in the sunlight.
<br/>Suzanne Bowen-Plasterer, Metchosin BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L Pod</b>! The Ls went north to the Fraser River yesterday (9/29) and came back down this afternoon (9/30). The most amazing season of sightings continue. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>L2's (L2, L78 and L88)</b> were encountered just south of <b>False Bay</b> at 3:30 p.m. (48° 45.95 N; 123° 07.681W) by Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit and Emma Foster. They were traveling south west. The encounter ended off Middle Bank (48° 41.53 N; 123° 03.052 W) with the whales heading west at <b>5:57 p.m</b>.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb reported S<b>outhern Resident orcas</b> were between Hannah Heights and South Beach, <b>San Juan Island</b> this <b>afternoon</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
All day there were no reports about the <b>J and K pod orcas</b> who were somewhere south of Whidbey Island in Puget Sound on this bright clear day. Finally they were seen from<b> Point No Point</b> in Admiralty Inlet at <b>3 pm</b>, heading north. At about <b>4:30</b> we found them between <b>Hood Canal and Marrowstone Island</b>, about two miles to the west, opposite Mutiny Bay on the west side of Admiralty. Their exhalations in a tight resting line were backlit by the autumn sun for at least a half hour, as they moved slowly northward. Eventually the line became a loose cluster of tall blows with occasional fins in the mist. For a while they continued north, then they all turned south, then the bunch turned north, then south, then north. We were getting dizzy and the evening winds got cold, so we left them, still miles away, still moving north, then south...we don't know which way they eventually went.

<b>September 29, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
It was another great encounter with some of <b>L Pod</b>, off <b>False Bay, San Juan Island</b>. It is always great to see the Southern Residents any time, especially the L's including the newest member, L115. They were coming up from the south and heading north. With the added bonus of plenty of sunshine and great looks at L 47 and her little calf, those of us on board the ' Pacific Explorer ' at <b>2pm</b>, would agree we had a 'whale of a time'. The little calf appeared to be so active with behaviours of spyhops, tail lobs and chasing of fish. (look for Marie's photo of L 115 with its mom in a future report! ) We even saw a few Dall's Porpoise interacting with the Orca. There is nothing nicer than being in the company of Orca in my opinion, especially mom's with their little ones.
<br/>Marie O'Shaughnessy. Prince of Whales
<br/>*<br/> 
Saw four <b>Orcas </b>at <b>Lagoon Point</b> (48 04' 22.33" 122 36' 52.00") at about <b>1:00 PM</b>. They circled in the rip for about 30 minutes and appeared to be feeding, but I'm not sure. The slapped the water frequently with their tails. 
I wasn't able to determine if any were males and didn't see where they went.
I haven't seen whales there in the past.
<br/>Gary Engman
<br/>*<br/>
Pete Bingham called from Hansville at<b> 5:58</b> to say <b>orcas </b>were passing <b>Point No Point</b>, Kitsap Peninsula, headed south.
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>12:40</b> Roger Clark called from his fishing boat to report about <b>a dozen orcas</b> traveling south off <b>Lagoon Point</b>, Whidbey Island, in Admiralty Inlet. He said there were at least two large males. I joined him at <b>1:30</b> and for the next 2 hours we moved only a mile or so. The whales, including <b>J1, J2, J28 and calf, J34 and K40</b>, were breaching, lobtailing and U-turning rapidly, indicating foraging. Roger said coho were running, though Chinook may have been among them. I then went by land to Bush Point, about 2 miles south, and waited another 20 minutes before the first ones came by in mid-channel. They took another hour till <b>4:20</b> to pass <b>Bush Point</b>, very slowly and very spread out.
<br/>*<br/>
Jennifer Hagerman called at <b>5:28pm</b> to say she was watching <b>orcas </b>headed south past <b>Mutiny Bay</b>, Whidbey Island.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1637</b>: <b>orca</b>, 2 maybe 3 groups, headed south fast in the shipping lanes. Probably at about the north end of <b>mutiny bay</b> now. I am just south of bush point and they are south of me and going fast.
<br/>Barbara Mundell
<br/>*<br/>
I had the great fortune to be on the beach just north of <b>Mutiny Bay</b> this afternoon about <b>4 o'clock </b>and saw many plumes in the distance. I guess maybe about a dozen <b>Orcas </b>spread out across Admiralty Passage were headed south towards Seattle at a leisurely pace. There were some breaches also, but they were pretty far from shore and i didn't have binoculars, so i couldn't really see much but the big splashes and some dorsal fins. But it made my day! 
<br/>Louise Salmin
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1525 SRs</b> - S19 and S5 calls on both <b>Lime Kiln and Orcasound hydrophones </b>now. Probably heading north. Also, Orca Network detected southern residents going south into Puget Sound passing Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island at 2pm, so listen today on Port Townsend and Seattle Aquarium, as well!
<br/>Scott Viers
<br/>*<br/>
Scott called from <b>Bush Pt.</b> at <b>3:51 </b>to report about ten <b>orcas </b>headed south past Bush Point, Whidbey Island.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:40 pm</b>: Bev Wenthin - pod of <b>orcas </b>off <b>Bush Pt</b>, mid-channel, just North of the buoy.
<br/>*<br/>
We were watching the [<b>orcas</b>] out front at <b>Lagoon Point</b> today beginning around <b>1:30</b>, breaching, playing and staying in the same area, they are still out there at <b>2:14</b>. My neighbor said that is where they were catching fish this morning so maybe that is what they are doing.
<br/>Sue Kukuk
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:05 pm:</b> pod of <b>orcas </b>4+ another pod further North off <b>Lagoon Pt.</b>
<br/>Marty Crowley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>13:53</b>: <b>Orca </b>at <b>lagoon point</b>.
<br/>Paul (Sent from my iPhone )
<br/>*<br/>
So exciting to see the pod of <b>orcas </b>passing <b>Lagoon Pt</b>. about <b>1:15</b>. Several males, I thought I saw at least 3, also some small one with them. I actually saw a small one trying to do tail lobs. Lots of breaches and spy hopping. The first group had about 5 and the second, maybe 10. I will be looking for your report. I wonder if they are feeding as they seemed to be hanging out in one area for a while as they slowly move Southward.
<br/>Merilyn Ohlson
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:00 PM</b> - There are two <b>pods </b>playing - full breaches - quite a show. One pod seems to be staying directly across from <b>Lagoon Point</b>, the other is headed South.
<br/>Lauryn Taylor
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb relayed a text message from Ron Bates about <b>15 orcas</b> off the south side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Ken and Wendy Eklund called Orca Network to report a <b>single orca</b> north of Olympic Shoal in <b>Budd Inlet</b> at <b>5:45</b>. They said they saw a black fin about 3 1/2 feet tall and heard the blows. It was headed SSW.
<br/><br/>
<b>September 28, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Sept. 28 - Oct. 1 - Nancy Laymance called Orca Network about hearing <b>blows </b>in the night for <b>three nights in a row</b>, from Wednesday, Sept 28 to Friday, Oct 1, from the northern tip of <b>Harstene Island</b>. No actual whales were seen, but the description of the sounds indicates that there were several orcas there at night. 
<br/>*<br/>
At 4:45 p.m. spotted a <b>Minke </b>in <b>Georgia Strait</b>, just off the Belle Chain Islets, near Saturna Island. We also observed lots of harbor seals on the islets and nearby water. It was a splendid afternoon, a lovely respite from all the fog and rain.
<br/>Nancy Westrell - Portland OR 
<br/>*<br/>
We started the whale watching portion of the trip at <b>Turn Point on Stuart Island</b>. Suddenly, whales started rounding Turn Point. Then more whales, then more! <b>Orca </b>after orca came toward the point, puffs of water vapor could be seen as distant whales headed our way and the orcas that passed by glistened in the sun. It was a super pod today, meaning all the whales from the Southern Resident community passed us by! Before seeing the whales we had seen harbor seals and bald eagles, after seeing the whales we saw MORE harbor seals, tons of wildlife on Spieden Island, a few <b>harbor porpoise</b> AND a <b>minke </b>whale!
<br/>Ashley Chapman, Naturalist
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>at <b>Lime Kiln and OrcaSound hydrophone</b>s at <b>5:40 pm</b>. 
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1722</b>: [<b>Orcas</b>] can now be heard on <b>Lime Kiln</b>. Whales heading southbound. Good visuals on the Center's Cam.
<br/>Cathy Bacon
<br/>*<br/>
We have the pleasure of being serenaded by Southern Resident orcas while we work on this report - they've been going strong on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b> - began listening at<b> 5 pm</b>, still going at <b>6:30 pm</b>.
<br/>Susan &amp; Howard, Orca Network, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:23 pm</b> - <b>Calls </b>on <b>OrcaSound </b>- Reports are it's all three pods heading south.
<br/>Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>~ 4 pm</b>: I am hearing occasional little high pitched <b>calls </b>- perhaps porpoise or even the Pacific White-Sided dolphins? (<b>Lime Kiln</b>).
<br/>Annika Bowden (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:50am calls</b> on <b>OrcaSound</b>-whistles, honks, clicks.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Many Southern Resident <b>S19 calls</b>, a few other calls (S18, S5), and clicks auto-detected this morning at Lime Kiln from <b>05:42:46</b> to 06:35:08.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound 
<br/><br/>
<b>September 27, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Between <b>Noon and 1, J Pod</b> headed south from <b>Lime Kiln</b>!
<br/>Katie O'Rourke
<br/>*<br/>
Still <b>hearing orcas - 11:28 am</b>. Mostly S19s and S18s, so there are definitely some Ls still out there. Occasionally another call is thrown in, too. They are just starting to become less frequent now at <b>11:25 AM</b>. I spoke too soon - the calls are much more numerous again at <b>11:45 AM</b>. Now including S37s, S16s, S17s, S10s, and more.
<br/>Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:53 am: Sounds </b>as if <b>L pod</b> is traveling north in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Very vocal and I got a few visuals of the whales from the Center's cam. Whales appear to be offshore. Airplane flying above. Hearing many S19's.
<br/>Cathy Bacon
<br/>*<br/>
Orca <b>calls </b>at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones - 9:34 am</b>, at both Lime Kiln &amp; <b>OrcaSound at 10:33 am &amp; 12:17 pm</b>.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:15 am</b>: Hearing first faint <b>calls </b>at <b>Orcasound </b>as they continue at<b> Lime Kiln</b>. Mostly S19s repeated, with an occasional S16. Perhaps Ls and Ks are northbound in Haro Strait?
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:54 am</b>: Periodic <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. <b>10:37 am</b>: Lots of clear orca sounds on OrcaSound right now! 
<br/>Gayle Swigart, Olympia, (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>12:30 PM</b>. Brown's Point Lighthouse Park in <b>Pierce County</b> WA. Saw a <b>Minke Whale</b> about 50 meters off the point. Blew twice and disappeared.
<br/>Guy McWethy, Renton, WA 
<br/><br/>
<b>September 26, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Near <b>False Bay</b> on the West Side, <b>San Juan Island</b>, it was the <b>Dall's Porpoise</b>. Though we didn't get to see them, there were also <b>Humpbacks and Transient Orcas</b> out there. Fog always is a problem, but fortunately yesterday it lifted a bit in time for our <b>1:00 trip</b>. 
<br/>Captain Jim Maya, Maya's charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/> 
The <b>T049A's</b> were interacting with <b>3 humpback whales</b> west of Constance Bank near <b>Victoria BC</b> in the <b>afternoon</b>.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria, BC
<br/><br/>
<b>September 25, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
One picture is of a <b>humpback </b>we saw feeding today and it gave us a good look at its missing pectoral flipper. Looks like the whale is doing just fine without it. On our way in from the cruise, we came across some killer whales. <b>CA51s?</b>
<br/>Kate Cummings, Sanctuary Cruises, <b>Moss Landing</b>. 
<br/><i>Very interesting humpback whale image. How many killer did you see? 5? Off of Moss Landing? Yes - these are some of the <b>CA51s: CA51A, CA51A-1, and CA51B</b>.
<br/>Alisa Schulman-Janiger, <b>California </b>Killer Whale Project, ACS/LA Gray WHale Census and Behavior Project 
</i>
<br/>*<br/>
We spot this beautiful <b>Orcas </b>3 miles from the Marietas Island pretty close to Banderas Bay in <b>Puerto Vallarta Mexico</b>. We saw 8 of them in Different groups. 
<br/>Victor Manuel Torres Garcia Gutierrez 
<br/>*<br/>
A wonderful late afternoon [<b>orca</b>] parade through <b>Active Pass</b> today around <b>5:15 pm</b>. They were heading east, moving quickly with only a few tail slaps and spy hops. At one point, there were about a dozen in a resting line, with their spoofs magnificently backlit. 
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Ks and some Ls</b> off of <b>False Bay</b>. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's San Juan Charters
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:12 pm:</b> faint <b>calls </b>at <b>lime kiln</b> now.
<br/>Bronwyn Panagis (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
From the 5 p.m. ferry going from Vancouver to Victoria, we saw around <b>15+ orcas</b> heading east past <b>Sturdies Bay</b> around <b>5:45 p.m.</b>. They were moving pretty fast, no other behaviors observed, but a nice way to come back to the Gulf Islands!
<br/>Nancy Westrell - Portland OR
<br/>*<br/>
Encounter with <b>Ino L-54</b> and her two offspring L-100 and L-108 as they foraged late in the day off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. On the Peregrine of Maya's Westside Charters, late <b>afternoon </b>off the south west side of San Juan Island. We encountered members of the <b>K12s, K14s, the L2s, L35s and also L12, L 85, L22, L79 and L89, K21, K40, K16, K35.</b> The L35s - Ino L54, Indigo L100 and Coho L108 were foraging. L54 burst through the surface with a fish flying through the air! images enclosed. 
Read more of the encounter on my blog post here.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Another <b>superpod </b>parade as lots of of orcas trickled by, slowly headed north along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Today offered another memorable experience with several orcas so close to shore that we could see them underneath the water.
<br/>Jane Cogan
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:52 am</b>: seeing <b>orcas </b>on orcaca m(NW. <b>San Juan Island</b>). 
<br/>Jaime Castro (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Hearing </b>them still at <b>Lime Kiln</b> and also at <b>OrcaSound </b>(louder)<b>-9:05am</b>. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:28 am:</b> hearing <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln</b> right now. :)
<br/>Debi Wayland (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported <b>J pod</b> heading north up <b>Haro Strait</b> at <b>noon</b>, and <b>K and L pods </b>at <b>Salmon Bank</b>. 
<br/><br/>
<b>September 24, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Humpback </b>calf breaching with its mom south of <b>Victoria </b>in the <b>morning</b>.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria BC 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2158</b>: Calls on both <b>Orcasound </b>and <b>Lime Kiln</b> hydrophones now. Many repeated S2iii calls at Lime Kiln with distant S19s. Clear calls at Orcasound with quiet background now that ship has passed. Perhaps they're very spread out continuing southward? 
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:35 pm</b>, Orca <b>calls </b>at <b>Lime Kiln</b>, 8:49 pm - Orca calls at Lime Kiln hydrophones. Orcas still at <b>OrcaSound</b>, <b>9:50 pm</b>.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
The Beam Reach boat was with SRKWs from <b>15:06-17:05</b> heading southwest into <b>Boundary Pass</b>.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach
<br/>*<br/>
We encountered members of <b>J, K, and L pod</b> quite spread out in <b>Boundary Pass</b> off of East Point, Saturna Island around <b>3pm </b>. They were more or less milling about, no real hurry to go one way or another. We positively ID'd <b>K12, K43 and K7, J26, L95, L5, and L77</b>. L5 and J26 got a bit "frisky" together, but what was really interesting was the "where" that this took place. There was a huge freighter coming through, and J26 was displaying his "pink sea snake" with L5 right in it's path. I'm horrible with distance estimates, but had they remained in that same spot another 45 seconds or so, I think the freighter would have plowed right into them. They didn't seem to mind it passing by. Odd choice of mood music!

Heard a few clear <b>calls </b>around <b>14:21 </b>on the <b>Orcasound </b>hydrophones. Beam Reach boat was moving with <b>SRKWs </b>off <b>Smallpox Bay</b> north at 11:56, south 12:08-12:23, but is now taking shelter from 20kt winds and analyzing data.
Just spoke with Jason who said they were with <b>J pod</b> around <b>noon </b>today and that the pod was headed north past <b>Kellett bluff</b> as they headed into analysis anchorage.
Lot's of L pod calls now (<b>3:45 pm</b>) at <b>Lime Kiln</b> suggest they may be heading north, too.
Not sure who made the 14:20ish calls at Orcasound.

<b>2:20 pm</b> - North<b> Haro Strait</b>. How lucky we were this afternoon to have the [<b>orcas</b>] swimming in the most protected waters during today's little storm! A group of 4 or 5 <b>Pacific White-sided Dolphins</b> made their way north approaching and swimming near and amongst several groupings of J pod and many of the various boats scattered along the two mile track of orcas and boats; like skipping children saying hi to everyone in the parade. We spent our time with <b>J1 and J2</b> and nearby, J14 and her 4 kids. So splendid!

About a dozen <b>orcas </b>in <b>Puget Sound</b> at <b>11:30</b>, off Restoration Pt., north of<b> Blake Island</b>, near <b>Bainbridge </b>Island. No direction of travel, no ID's, no photos. Called in by Richard, deck hand on the Bainbridge ferry.

As we headed down island at <b>1:30</b> to watch Orcas, we heard that there might be some Lags out there. Near Hannah Heights, on the West Side of San Juan Is. we spotted them. Amazing! Along with <b>Orcas</b>, Lags are a true dolphin, and are so fun to watch. The love playing along side the boats, and will often make eye contact with you.

We arrived on scene in <b>Boundary Pass</b> and <b>J's and K's</b> were all together resting and then they all woke up with breaches and spyhops like crazy!
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
After receiving a report of <b>J's, K's and L's</b> heading southwest from <b>East Point</b> along with a pod of <b>Pacific white-sided dolphins</b>, Center for Whale Research staff Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster, Barbara Todd and Stefan Jacobs departed Snug Harbor at 12:49 p.m. We encountered the <b>L22's and L12</b> in a tight group heading southwest in Boundary Pass at <b>1:19 p.m.</b> (48° 42.861 N; 123° 05.664 W). The whales were spread out in tight groups traveling slowly. The next group we encountered was the rest of the L12's and L54's, who were soon joined by the <b>L26's, L5 and L84</b>. We later encountered most of the <b>J's and K's</b> in a tight group. The encounter ended just off Turn Point with the <b>L47's L86's and L95</b> milling and moving south at <b>3:43 p.m</b>. (48° 41.356 N; 123° 14.410 W). The whales later turned and went up <b>Swanson Channel</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
This <b>afternoon </b>on the Western Prince we had an amazing encounter with members of <b>K and L Pods</b> just off of <b>Turn Point </b>around <b>3:30 PM</b>. We saw just about everything including breaches, spyhops, tail slaps, logging, foraging, great vocalizations both above and under the surface via the hydrophone, and even whales cruising in the wake of a freighter and K25 Scoter coming to the surface with a salmon in his mouth! I saw for sure the <b>L54s, L72s, L26s, K13s, as well as K40, K21, and L87</b>, but there were many more whales there, including some far in the distance that ended up going up Swanson Channel. It was a phenomenal day, and many more photos will be on my blog.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> joined a mix of <b>Southern Residents</b>, including Calypso (L94) and newly named calf Cousteau (L113) around <b>1.30 pm</b> in <b>Boundary Pass</b>. The whales were mostly traveling in tight groups with the occasional spyhop, breach or lob-tail. Passengers on 'Mystic Sea' gazed entranced as the whales moved with grace and purpose, the peaceful scene broken only by the sound of powerful exhalations carrying across the calm water and an excited little boy shouting, "I heard it squirt!" A magical day in the company of nature.

Today we headed up to <b>Turn Point on Stuart Island </b>just in time to see the [<b>orcas</b>] start coming around the corner from the Northeast. Many of them fanned out as they hit Haro Strait while a few hugged the shoreline, porpoising along the dramatic cliffs of Stuart Island. We observed many different behaviours including cartwheels, spy hops, foraging, logging, breaching, socializing, etc. Captian Hobbes put the hydrophone in the water and the vocals and echolocation clicks were phenomenal. We identified <b>L79, L41, L26, L92, L90, L72 and L105</b> in the first pass. L26 and offspring foraged below the cliffs before heading south. We then moved NW of Turn Point and enjoyed numerous encounters with Kpod. We saw <b>K40 and K21</b>, who did a nice breach . . . and then as a tanker passed many whales started to surf in it's stern wake. We saw many big fins with spray coming off the top of them, lots of speed and wow! what an experience. Whales continued to forage in the upwellings and tide rips. We saw many members of K-pod including <b>K37, K20, K26, K34</b> and just when you think it can't get any better (as John Boyd is telling everyone he has yet to get a picture of a whale with a fish in its mouth) K25 comes by the bow with a fish in its mouth. We could see his teeth!!!! A first for me after 13 years on the water! Monika Wieland was on board and got pictures. We did not confirm any sightings of Jpod, but understand that they were the whales we could see far to the north. We also saw lots of Harbor Seals, Bald Eagles and Harbor Porpoise on our way back to Friday Harbor.

All who witnessed this event were awestruck. From my vantage point, on the starboard bridge wing of the Alaska Ferry Columbia (height of eye 64' above the water), docked at Alaska Ship and Dry dock, Tongass Narrows where the channel width is 340 yards; I saw 
<b>Orca's</b> male and female, young and old, in groups of 5 to 15, stretched out over 1.5 miles, swimming (east to west) by us for 10-15 minutes. I believe a conservative estimate of <b>total count would be 75-100</b>. 
<br/>Scott Hendrickson, Master, M/V Columbia, <b>Ketchikan, AK</b>
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received two calls reporting a HUGE pod of <b>orcas </b>traveling north up <b>Tongass Narrows</b>, off <b>Ketchikan </b>Alaska in  morning: First call from Scott Hendrickson, reporting <b>60 - 100 orcas</b> heading north up the Tongass Narrows a little after <b>7 am AK time</b>, passing by in dozens of groups spread out over a mile. Second report was from Mark Hutson, also a ferry crew member, who observed them pass by in about 20 groups of from 3 - 17 orcas in each group, some groups made up mainly of juveniles. They were spread out over a mile, took 30 minutes to pass by. He said in 35 years up there he has never seen anything like this - "it was shocking!". He said a large male brought up the end of the parade.

I'm on the M S Amsterdam heading south. Current position is N47 58 19.2 W125 16 55.6, 30 miles straight west of <b>LaPush, WA</b>. We see a small group of <b>Humpbacks </b>headed south.

Center staff Ken Balcomb, Barbara Todd and Stefan Jacobs encountered <b>J's</b> just off <b>Open Bay</b> at <b>3:41 p.m</b>. (48° 58.641 N; 123° 20.377 W). The whales were very spread out heading north. They followed the whales up to Stuart Island before turning around and heading back toward Henry Island. The encounter ended in Open Bay with K21 heading north at 5:46 p.m.(48° 57.177 N; 123° 18.723 W).

By the time we left Friday Harbor, the leaders were already passing quickly past <b>Lime Kiln</b> into the much smoother waters by <b>Henry Island</b>. Once again, as is proving this fall, it was a very mellow day with few boats, calming waters, and sunny skies. The whales were spread in small groups ranging from 2-10 whales per group. But they were still very active, and were spending more time than normal hanging around the surface. We had <b>J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, the J17s, J28 Polaris and her calf Star, L87, K25</b> and more. We watched as the whales once again zig-zagged in and out of currents. As we were approaching Stuart Island, we made a detour as we came across about <b>12 Dall's Porpoises</b>-- my first sighting for 2010!!! They were definitely bow riders, and even decided to bow ride a few orcas as well!
<br/>John Boyd, SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Captain Craig started to receive reports of whales on the west side of <b>San Juan</b> heading north. We passed <b>Henry Island</b> and started to see whales spread out around the north end of San Juan. <b>J1 "Ruffles"</b> was traveling close to shore with a few other members of the <b>J pod</b>. We identified J16 "Slick" and J30 "Riptide". Riptide is a "sprouter" male born in 1995. "Sprouter" is the term we use for juvenile males as they mature and their dorsal fin becomes taller and pointier. Riptide's handsome dorsal fin appears to be getter larger every time I see him.

<b>1909 </b>- The <b>L2s </b>have been near <b>Lime Kiln</b> for the last couple hours foraging anywhere from 1/2 mile north about 1/2 mile offshore and last seen going down island, south of the light about 1/2 hour ago. I believe that is still them on the Lime Kiln Hydrophones now.

We had a vague rumor of some whales that had passed Eastpoint in the early morning fog--no direction, no confirmation on if they were Residents or Transients. So off we went. Soon we could see a couple of boats that were watching whales. We waited for the whales to pick a direction, and talked to the passengers about whale life histories, and soon we were treated what would turn out to be my second best day on the water for the year!
From 1/2 a mile away, we could see large masses of whales coming to the surface simultaneously. They approached closer and closer and soon the waters in every direction seemed to have a whale surfacing. And the surfacings were slow and lazy, zigging and zagging in various directions. It soon became obvious that the whales were feeling very social as there was a lot of upside down swimming, pec slaps, tail slaps, pushing and shoving. And the spyhops! My favorite behavior--one after another after another! Even a double spyhop! It was as if the whales were checking out each boat as they were passing by. And soon the breaching began. It was like a whale behavior primer all at the same time! I was so amazed that I didn't even take pictures. It was such a happy time, and I found myself caught up in the moment as if it were my first time to see whales again. And the passengers made it sound like the 4th of July--or as I call it, responding to "Orca Fireworks"! We saw <b>J30 Riptide, L41 Mega</b> (who did some amazingly huge tail slaps!), and it was a bittersweet moment when <b>L72 Racer</b> passed by without her calf. Soon an hour had passed, and our allotted time with whales was up, so we slowly headed out of the area and made our way back to Friday Harbor. I think most people had sore cheek muscles from smiling so much.

At approximately <b>1100 </b>[<b>orcas</b>] were traveling in large, tight groups while approaching Lighthouse Marine Park in <b>Point Roberts</b>. Once they past the park they spread out into to foraging groups. They were moving slowly and it was six hours before they were off East Point, Saturna Island. Even at East point they weren't in a hurry while some changed directions to do some foraging. Quite often it is an approximate 3 hour orca trip from Point Roberts to East Point and I have seen &gt;7 hours taken by them on this route. As all boats were following them down Boundary Pass Lifeforce found a large group of "trailers" on our way home. It looked like L115 close to mom too. 
[<b>Orcas</b>] returned off <b>Point Roberts</b> at approximately <b>1445 </b>heading South. It was a bit unusual for all three pods to return so quickly as they had been at Turn Point heading South late yesterday and were found up by the Fraser River earlier today. That was a quick turnaround when usually only 1 pod or so may split and head North. This time they were very spread out over miles. They were mostly traveling in small groups.

Fog, fog, fog! Friday and Saturday (9/17-18), fog, fog, fog! Fortunately, the Residents were up North, where the fog is not usually such a factor. This morning (9/19) is a different story. Rain, hail, and fog and then sun and now it's raining again. September is usually such a wonderful month, weather wise and whale wise. <b>Js, Ks and Ls</b> coming down from <b>Vancouver </b>this afternoon (9/19).

The <b>orcas </b>decided to head south just in time for us to see them this <b>evening</b>, and far enough south that they were in reach. : ) Lots of Orcas, very SPREAD out. It was a gorgeous evening on the water out in <b>Boundary Pass</b>. We picked them up at East Point. Whales talkin, active little ones, and loud bangs from the adults breaching off in the distance. Its amazing the sound they make landing on the water.. Beautiful! On our way back in, a Harbor Seal had a fish in its mouth. It was actually quite cute!

We encountered 15 or so <b>Dall Porpoise</b> off <b>Lime Kiln</b>. Initially, they were 500 yards away and moving slowly westward.

Well the season is drawing to a close here. Many of our migratory animals have already begun their journey either south or out into the open ocean. The Puffins once again become "plain Brown Birds as Captain refers to them and fly/swim out to their middle of the ocean home to bob around all winter. Most of the Humpbacks have either dispersed to some new feeding areas closer to Prince William Sound where there is still some feed before they embark on their journey either to Hawaii or Mexico. In any case I got lucky and hopped on a boat on my Birthday day off was what a day! Sapphire Skies to boot, and even a few Tufted Puffins, although losing their tufts still swimming around. We encountered a Mother <b>Humpback and her Calf</b> out near No Name Island in the Chiswell's and we spent some time with them which was sheer luck this late in the season. The day even despite getting caught in a fog bank near Barwell Island was magic. As we reentered Resurrection Bay on our way back to Seward, all the sudden Captain Rich did a complete U-turn and headed back into the gulf. No announcement made at all and I knew it was something bigger than a bird. Gratefully we came upon two rather stealthy <b>Transient Orcas</b>, both large males apparently doing some hunting maybe for Dall Porpoise as we were in their area. Anyway what a fantastic birthday it was and a marvelous closing to my Season here in Kenai Fjords.

Plenty of cetacean education today (say that one fast...) Calm conditions ruled as <b>Ruffles and Granny</b> came into view off the west side of <b>San Juan</b> around <b>1.20 pm</b>, along with other members of <b>J pod</b> including Mums and babies. They were foraging in various directions either individually or in small groups, but were never far apart from the rest of the pod. A <b>minke </b>made a quick appearance off <b>Salmon Bank</b>, and around twenty vocal Stellers were 'giving it large' on Whale Rocks. An extra bonus was a sleepy California sea lion resting on a navigational buoy, plus half a dozen harbor porpoise swimming together and some harbor seals.

We moved on to see <b>orcas</b>, lots and lots of orcas! My favorite part was seeing a mom and calf interact and play around it was amazing to see how curious and playful the calf was! Plus we heard orcas vocalizing in AND out of the water and saw so many(/much) peck flaps, tail slaps, spy hopping, breaches, playing around, nuzzling, familial bonding. The <b>Southern residents</b> were definitely out and about!
Our day ended with a Steller sea lion and both <b>Harbor and Dall's porpoises</b>, who were bow riding on another boat, on our way back. You cannot top the day we had with the marine wildlife, especially the orcas. They are clearly such intelligent and playful animals, I'm continually amazed and awed and inspired by these beautiful creatures.

After receiving reports of whales off Vctoria waterfront Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research departed San Juan in vessel Shachi. He encountered the following whales in their family groups <b>L85, L89, L12, L41, L77, L26, L90, L92, L72, L95, L105, L55, L82, L103, L109, L86, L106, L112, L27, L47, L83, L91, L110, L5, L84, L54, L100, L108 and L115</b>. They were first encountered off <b>Discovery Island</b> at <b>3:00 p.m</b>. (48° 41.12 N, 123° 24.31 W) and headed towards <b>False Bay</b> before turning south.

At <b>sunset</b>, somewhere in between <b>Pearl and Hermes Atoll and Midway</b>, (N27:19, W177:01) the NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette came across a group of four killer whales. There were three adult female sized animals and one juvenile in the group.
For tropical killer whales they were pretty tolerant of the big ship but as soon as we started to launch the small boat they vanished. Have fun,

Captain Craig, Naturalist Sally, and a crew of enthusiastic of guests and I departed Friday Harbor having heard word that their were the mammal-hunting (a.k.a. <b>transient) orcas</b> west of <b>Victoria</b>. Unsure if we could reach them, we headed that direction with high hopes. As we cruised into the Haro Strait we heard word of a Humpback within our range south of Victoria. So humpback searching we went! As we headed that way, word changed again and transient whales were reported southwest of Victoria. So transient orca searching we went! We finally spotted transient dorsal fins in the distance once we passed Victoria! We were lucky enough to see <b>2 young transients</b> (one very young calf), at least <b>2 (but probably 3) females</b>, and <b>T20</b>. T20 and the rest of his pod, T21 &amp; T22, were involved in one of the only documented altercation between transient and resident orcas. Generally, residents and transients tend to ignore or actively avoid being around each other. They don't interbreed, don't eat the same food, and are thought to have entirely differently languages. In most cases, when residents and transients get within a few miles of one another the groups either pass as if they don't notice each other, or the transients actively avoid the residents. Researchers didn't really understand why this was, until 1993 when a researcher encountered J Pod porpoising at the three transient orcas. It appeared that the transients were clearly attempting to flee the situation. At the time J Pod had a young calf in the pod, J28 (Polaris) and this incident may have occurred because the residents were trying to keep the marine-mammal eating orcas away from their young. No one can ever be certain why this incident occurred, however, so all possible answers will be speculations. Such incidents are rare, but may be the reason the "tougher" seeming mammal eating orcas avoid any interaction with the resident community.
It was quite an amazing day. Our guests were very adaptable, going with the flow, and boy were they rewarded for their patience. Today just goes to show (to quote myself on the trip today) - when watching wildlife, you don't know what you'll see until you're pulling back into the harbor. Over and out,

Here is an image from our wonderful encounter with <b>4 Humpback Whales</b> off <b>Victoria </b>including a Mother and very very active calf! We were only a few miles south of Victoria this afternoon, when came across 2 Humpback Whales, one of which was "Spli t Fin", a Humpback Whale that has visited the area for at least 3-4 years now. We watched these two Humpback Whales for a while and saw several tail flukes as they made deep dives. Then we headed a little further south and came across the Mother and Calf. Not long after we arrived on scene the young Calf made an amazing cartwheel just over 100 yds from our boat much to the delight of our passengers and crew!

We spent a little time with two <b>humpbacks </b>on Sunday, about 1.5 miles E of the Victor Gulf buoy in the St<b>rait of Juan deFuca</b>. One had a deep notch in its dorsal fin, but we didn't get a good enough look at the flukes to try to get an ID. 
Also saw a <b>minke </b>outside of <b>Cattle Pass</b> about noon, and another off Partridge Point around <b>5:30 pm</b>.
Also, at Whale Rocks in Cattle Pass we spotted a branded Steller's Sea Lion hauled out with about a dozen others. Thanks to your very helpful page on the subject, I learned that this particular sea lion was branded at Rogue Reef in 2003 (#183R). Among the Steller's there at the time was another one with some kind of wound or growth around his left eye; didn't seem to be bothering him but still didn't look so good.

A glassy sea made for clear viewing of well spread out Southern Residents off the south side of <b>San Juan Island</b> around <b>1.30 pm</b>. Of particular interest (and mystery) was an <b>orca </b>'playing' with a Steller sea lion - little surface activity other than a waving pectoral fin followed by some turbulence in the water and a quick sight of the Steller's hind flippers disappearing.

<b>San Juan Island</b>: This morning we encountered <b>L72 and L105</b> carrying <b>a dead killer whale calf</b> off the west side of San Juan Island. We followed the whales for just <b>over 6 hours</b>, and most of the time the calf was not visible, but on occasion L72 would lift the calf out of the water when she was surfacing. When we were able to see the calf L72 appeared to either be pushing it in front of her balanced on her rostrum or would be carrying the calf on the top of her head, but the calf was negatively buoyant, so had probably not been dead for long. Although L105, L72's ~6 year old son, was within 50 or 100 m for most of the time, we did not see L105 interacting with the dead calf. Based on the size of the calf (approximately 6-7') we suspect it was near-term but no way to know whether it was stillborn or born alive and died shortly afterward. Upon surfacing L72 would frequently appear to 'drop' the calf and both whales would stop and dive deep to recover it. From the photos it appears the calf was a female, and the umbilical is still attached and clearly visible. When we left the whales early this evening L72 still had the calf with her.

Sighted <b>2 Orca</b> for sure, when they came back east I thought at one point there were 3. They were in <b>Hammersley Inlet</b> at approximately N 047 12.360 - W 123 1.66, traveling west at <b>9 AM</b>. East at <b>11AM</b>.
On the way west they were surfacing a lot. On the way east, they sounded right about the listed location and did not surface again in sight (I can see east to about 47 11.943). There was some construction noises going on at Skookum point - loud miter saw. The inlet is only 1/4 mile wide, and they were on the side opposite of me - much deeper water. I have noticed several harbor seals around in the morning lately - there must be food in the area.

A breaching <b>killer whale</b> (Lpod?) in front of <b>Victoria</b>. Photo was taken around <b>5 pm</b>. The animals grouped up and were speed porpoising towards San Juan Island. It was a sight to behold!

We saw members of <b>J pod</b> on the south end of San Juan near <b>Salmon Bank</b>. Once again we identified <b>J26 </b>"Mike". Then, we saw more whales, possibly members of <b>L pod</b>, along the west side of San Juan around <b>Eagle Point</b>. The whales were widely spread out in all directions, traveling in groups of about 5-10. Every day is different and today we got a little taste of everything. We saw spyhopping, porpoising, breaching, and tail lobbing. The best part is that they are in their wild habitat.

Both Center for Whale Research vessels encountered <b>J's and a few K's and L's</b> spread out off <b>Salmon Bank</b> at <b>2:12 p.m</b>. (48° 25.564,123° 01.031 W). The whales were spread out in mixed groups, milling and socializing. Both vessels were coordinating with the zeppelin "Eureka" to conduct aerial surveys of the southern residents (see reports and below on this research project). The encounter ended just off <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b> at <b>4:08 p.m</b>. (48° 31.149 N, 123° 09.873 W) The whales continued north up the west side.

Airship "Eureka" Research Project - report from Brad Hanson, NOAA Fisheries - San Juan Islands: Follows is short summary of our overflight of <b>southern resident killer whales</b> on the Farmer's Airship Eureka that is owned and operated by Airship Ventures. Farmer's Insurance generously donated 2 days of aircraft time on the zeppelin to allow the NWFSC, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the <b>Center for Whale Research</b> to collect various types of imagery from this unique perspective.
Inclement weather on 7 Sept for most of the day resulted in the flight being scrubbed. Although the weather on the 8th constrained our flight on both ends of the day we did get <b>about an hour with the whales</b> - while this did allow us to get some good imagery on the different systems the sample size was small but likely enough to illustrate proof of concept and give us an idea of what types of modifications would improve our ability to collect these types of data operationally. Included is an image of a whale suitable for photogrametrics collected by Erin Heydenreich. It will probably be at least a couple of months before WHOI has had an opportunity to process the video imagery. What was particularly amazing to me was how well this platform allowed observation of various whale behaviors. Because we could essentially remain virtually stationary we could see several whale groups simultaneously as well as see down into the water column, I observed what appeared to be a fish chase, defecation, and possible nursing - all within an hour! We are extremely grateful to Airship Ventures for their commitment to making this project happen, particularly under challenging weather conditions, and to Farmer's Insurance for their financial support for the flight time. It was an amazing opportunity.

<br/>*<br/>Airship "Eureka" Research Project - San Juan Islands: The Airship "Eureka", which has been on a tour of the Pacific Northwest since mid August, took a flight over <b>Haro Strait</b>. Eureka, one of the largest zeppelins in the world, is operated by Airship Ventures based in California. Farmers Insurance donated two days of flight time to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in collaboration with North West Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and the Center for Whale Research (CWR). The purpose of the mission was to get aerial photographs of southern resident killer whales for photogrammetry studies as well as to examine vessel-whale distribution. In 2008 the Center for Whale Research participated in an initial photogrammetric study of southern residents using a helicopter as the aerial photography platform (see Encounter 49). In addition to collecting updated measurements, this mission served as a opportunity to test out an alternative aerial platform for similar studies in the future. Measurements taken from aerial photographs can be used to look at individual growth, body condition and nutritional status. Due to weather constraints the 2 day mission was reduced to a half day mission which took place on Wednesday. Eureka departed Paine Field in Everett Washington at 1:55 p.m. Among those on board were Brad Hanson of NMFS, and Erin Heydenreich of CWR. Approximately an hour later the airship arrived at the south end of San Juan Island where resident killer whales were reported off the <b>Salmon Bank</b> buoy. The airship was coordinating with both Center vessels, Orca and Shachi, as well as the NOAA vessel, Phocina 2, to identify the individual whales being photographed from above. The airship hovered around False Bay for about 45 minutes to an hour before turning north east to pass over Roche Harbor and then headed back to Paine Field where it landed at <b>6:00 p.m</b>. 
For more photos of the trip go to the Airship Adventures Blogspot 
The whales observed were <b>J's, K's and L's</b>. They were spread out in mixed social groups. Many whales were milling off False Bay. The whales reportedly went north later that evening.

One of our biologists, Gerry Hayes, took some <b>killer whale</b> photos while fishing in <b>Squaxin Passage</b>, which is on the boundary between Thurston and Mason Counties. Presumably, these are transients. We were wondering if any of you can ID the male with the serrations in his dorsal fin. Have there been any other killer whale observations in South Puget Sound in the last couple of days?

<br/><i>The orca with the serrated fin is <b>T63</b>, "Chainsaw" - visiting the Puget Sound area over the past week - ON</i>
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>2:30 p.m.</b>, a neighbor called to say there were three <b>orcas </b>on the south side of <b>Squaxin Isl</b>, heading toward Hope Isl. We got in the car and went to the Steamboat Isl. Bridge. We could see the three coming out of Totten Inlet at around <b>4:15</b> snugging the far shore. They then headed north and went into <b>Hammersley Inlet</b> - almost to Shelton. We eventually lost them and headed back to our homes on Eld Inlet. Within 20 -30 minutes or so, they were IN Eld Inlet at the tip of Cooper Point. They went south into Eld only about 1000 feet and then circled back, across Cooper Point and toward Boston Harbor and that shoreline.
They then headed toward Dana Passage - but we lost sight of them because it was way into dusk. We lost sight at around <b>7:30</b>.

We headed to <b>False Bay</b>, and saw several <b>residents </b>including <b>J8, J30, L7, L53, L72, and L105</b>. They were spread out with some directional changes, tail lobbing from J30, and some surface splashing - possibly feeding. Next we headed to Whale Rocks and saw 4 Steller sea lions hauled out, growling at each other, and one in the water. We were going back up San Juan Channel and came across more porpoise, and then, the absolute cherry on top (report continued under "Pacific White-sided dolphins").

We were going back up <b>San Juan Channel </b>and came across more porpoise, and then, the absolute cherry on top - <b>Pacific white sided dolphins</b>!!! There were maybe a dozen or so, and as we turned to meet them they headed for our bow! Along side us was a mom and calf. They soon tired of our slow but respectful speed, and continued on their way south. Interesting to see them now, since transients have been sighted pretty consistently lately.

After Sandy's phone call, we headed to Coupeville - and learned that <b>Chainsaw </b>and gang were in <b>Penn Cove</b> again today - we saw them heading out by Monroe Landing, and they seemed to disappear, no sign of them after a good half hour of watching from Long Point (we arrived back home around 12:15 or so). Am pretty positive I saw 5 dorsals at one point. Then Sarah Schmidt took her spotting scope to Long Point and found them way over by Crescent Harbor (after we'd left).

Watched a large pod of <b>Orcas </b>swim by <b>East Point on Saturna Island</b> around <b>noon</b>. They came from up north or northwest and swam right around the point, then west out in the Straight of Georgia. We think there were about 25 Orcas in total. We saw several calves. Parts of the pod came very close to the shore, around 10 meters from it. Maybe around 10-15 orcas were this close, the rest of the pod were much further out, surrounded by whale watching boats. The currents are very strong right there, so they traveled slowly. We saw them breach, spyhop, do fluke lifts, pectoral slaps and waves and rolling.

<b>3 to 5 Orca</b> sighted at <b>Penn Cove, Whidbey Island,</b> 100 to 200 Yards off shore from the Capt. Whidbey Inn. They were just cruising, circulating around Penn Cove. Our first sighting was approx <b>7:30 AM until 10:00 AM</b>.

We were at <b>Turn Pt, Stuart Island</b> after hiking from Prevost Hbr. It was a beautiful day for whale watching and here they came at about <b>4:15PM</b>, an estimated group of 20 [<b>orcas</b>]. The problem was the whale watching boat which cruised right thru them to locate at the head of their direction, over the course of about a 1/3 to 1/2 mile. The whales soon dived after the boat drove thru them and did not resurface, but were with us for about 45 min. before the whale boat arrived.

Haro Strait /1/2 mile west of <b>Henry Island</b> / <b>2:45 pm</b>. <b>J27-Blackberry</b> surfaced 'round and around us 10 to 12 times as he pursued a large chinook salmon. We had been sitting at rest for a while when he popped up from the depths and swirled this way and that with the big fish repeatedly giving him the slip under the boat. Everyone on board were thrilled to be so kinesthetically involved in the hunt. He finally caught it about 100 yards off our stern. This is such a rare experience I wanted to make sure it made it into the Orca Network log.
<br/>Deborah Martyn, Orcas Express 
<br/>*<br/> 
Observed around <b>12-15 orcas</b> passing by the west side of <b>North Pender Island</b> just before sunset, all from 1/4 to 1/2 miles out from shore in Swanson Channel. Several of them were milling out in the channel, so my count may be off. They headed towards Active Pass. The evening was so quiet that I could hear them breathe, even though they were rather far out from shore.

With a report of last night's transient orcas still in Penn Cove, Coupeville, we launched 'Hyshka' (named after my adopted orca, J37, meaning 'blessing' or 'thank you' in Coast Salish) and sped off more in hope than expectation. Just beyond <b>Long Point, Coupeville</b>, around <b>noon</b>, the distinctive dorsal fin of <b>'Chainsaw' (T63)</b> came into view cruising along the shoreline with a female and juvenile. We watched the whales for a couple of hours keeping a considerable distance beyond the 100 yard requirement as they traveled along searching for prey. Their typical speed was 8 - 10 mph most of the time except when foraging or milling - lucky Whidbey Island land based viewers filled the air with cries and cheers as they heard the blows and witnessed the wonder of nature. 'Chainsaw' and friends gave us the slip off <b>Hidden Beach</b> - in typical transient fashion they just disappeared.

Today was a great day out on Soundwatch. We had early morning reports of [<b>orcas</b>] near <b>Eagle Point</b>, so we knew we'd probably be busy as it is getting to be peak fishing season and the "last" weekend of summer vacation with the approach of Labor Day. At <b>1100</b>, we arrived on-scene and saw that <b>Ks and some Ls</b> were forming a long resting line. Having whales moving off-shore made it more manageable for approaching private vessels and giving them the guidelines. The whales continued in this resting pattern until after lunch, when they decided to head back towards shore and do some fishing. Where we had one large resting group in the morning, the <b>afternoon </b>had the whales spread over 3+ miles, which meant a lot more work keeping an eye on things. Again, most boaters were very cooperative and receptive to the guidelines. We left the whales at <b>1645 </b>as they were heading back towards Hein Bank.

The encounter began just off <b>Kellett Bluff</b> at <b>2:41 p.m</b>.(48° 34.818 N, 123° 12.406 W) with the T18's traveling in a tight group close to shore. They made a harbor seal kill along the shore of Henry Island. The encounter ended just south of <b>Stuart Island</b> at <b>3:53 p.m</b>. (48° 39.035N,123° 11.472W) with the whales heading north along the shoreline.

I was sitting at Brooks Point on South Pender Island this evening (9/1) around <b>7-8pm</b> and watched a <b>HUGE pod of orcas</b> swim and jump and dive off the southern point of Saturna Island between <b>Saturna and Patos Islands</b>. They were spread out over most of the space between the islands, but were all over the place, so I'm assuming it's the super pod I just read about in the update email. I stayed until it got dark and they weren't really going anywhere, just hanging out it seemed.
