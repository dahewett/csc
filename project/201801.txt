South Puget Sound - Approx <b>2:30 p.m. - Gig Harbor, 2 Orcas</b> came thru as we were on a boat moving slowly watching and listening to eagles. They both passed so close we watched as we were glared at, at least we thought so, as on the other side were seals. The Orcas pushed the seals inland, and once could not get them they turned around and waited, and after a few minutes swam right back past us waiting to see if the seals moved out from shore....Yes, <b>in the harbor</b>, there are a bunch of homes on the right side after you pass under the bridge, about 4 boats stopped and watched for about 35 minutes. Amazing experience! We took some pics, will place here. My wife thought she was going to be chum! -Timothy Edick

Northern Residents - (Email received February 6th regarding the January 27th encounter with the <b>A42s</b> as documented in our January 28th Whale Report.) <b>Orcas, at least 5, in Sechelt Inlet</b>. A pod of orcas have made their way up the coast, spotted last week rubbing themselves on the smooth rocks on a beach located in the Georgia Straight. We're a small BC town and orcas have been known to pop by every few years, and we're lucky enough again to have them in our small coastal inlet again. From what I can tell from my on shore sighting and also videos posted online, the pod is at least 5 including two youngsters. At the time of initial spotting they were breaching. Which of course was a huge surprise. Only one boat went out to go and see them, and the whales were quite curious and intrigued, swimming around and underneath the hull. -Sacha Kalman

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Northern Residents - Have amazing footage by iPhone of <b>orcas (5-6) close up near shoreline playing and Rubbing themselves on pebbles</b>?  Filmed today January 27th around <b>0830 am West Sechelt BC</b>. Long version video below by husband Bruce Robinson. -Lesley Adams 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Northern Residents, the A42s beach-rubbing. </b>An amazing right-time right-place encounter for the many humans who stand in witness as this family of orcas engage in this cultural activity just feet from shore at Golden Mile Beach, Sechelt, BC. -Video by Bruce Robinson, January 27, 2018 
<br/>(<i>ID by Jackie Hildering, The Marine Detective, BC researcher &amp; educator. See below.</i>)  
<br/><i>Jackie Hildering provided IDs and information on the rubbing which she included with a post on her Marine Detective page with someone else's video of the same encounter:  
"There they go again - the <b>A42s beach-rubbing</b> and it creating a great deal of excitement (and misinterpretation) amongst a lot of we humans. The same happened almost two years ago to the day when a video of them also went viral. "Beach rubbing" is a social behaviour specific to the culture of the "Northern Resident" population (and a few families in Alaska). Not a rare behaviour at all. It's rare that we humans get to see it. Led to my being interviewed by the BBC, etc. due to my IDing the whales and 
discussing the behaviour in THIS BLOG:"</i>

January 27 - ...Luckily, the whales were already <b>off south Kellett Bluff</b> and about mid-strait when "Orcinus" arrived on scene at about <b>1630</b>. "Peregrine" reported finding another group on their way south that they believed to be the T18s after their original group headed off in the direction of Halibut Island. Dave was just arriving on scene and saw a straight-finned male spread out from another couple of other whales heading north when a large group of females, juveniles, and a sprouter appeared in a tight ball much closer. This was "Peregrine's" original group and it included the <b>T100s, including the T100Bs, and the T124As minus the T124A2s.</b>. -Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 3.

January 27 - <b>10:00 a.m - Reported as probable gray whale (later corrected to uncertain) in Gig Harbor</b> by John Dean, who says a very big whale with a fluke at least 8 -10' across. After more  discussion  with John: the whale was in <b>Hales Passage, between Wolchott Bay and Point Fosdick</b> close to shore heading eastbound towards Tacoma Narrows. Only the fluke was seen, he is not sure what type of whale. By description of the tail and that it presented it's fluke this sounds to be either a humpback or a gray whale.

<b>3:30 p.m. - Orca Sighting: 2 male orcas, San Juan Channel</b> 48.563084 -123.032801(north of Point Caution - ALB). Spotted two slow moving males who surfaced 3 times and then disappeared. Slow moving probably feeding then traveling north towards Orcas. Looked to be transient, only dorsal fin visible.. Unfortunately no photos. -Carolyn Spence

Southern Residents - <b>4 Orcas by our shore at 2:30pm today- Mayne Island, Edith Point</b>. Nice orcas, including one breach...right in front of our home facing Georgia Straight on Mayne island, Edith Point. Close to shore. Seals were very scared. They were hugging the coast quite close (more than in recent years) and heading south towards Saturna and then US waters. One shot has clear markers. Are these transient or resident? <b>L87 Onyx</b> while traveling inshore along with a few other members of <b>Jpod off Edith Point, Mayne Island</b>, BC - Strait of Georgia. <b>J45 Se-Yi'-Chn</b> (born 2009) off Edith Point, Mayne Island. -Photo by Yves Tiberghien, January 23, 2018

January 23 - <b>2:15 p.m. - A whale was sighted between Manchester fuel depot and Bainbridge Island</b> heading west toward the fish pens. It had a lengthwise linear pattern on its underside. I saw it jump twice coming fully out of the water both times. I was very excited to see this. Any idea what the species is?.. After more discussion: The whale was not an orca or porpoise variety. It had striations on the underside and it breached fully out of the water on two occasions that I saw, one time after the other. The first time it was more broadside, the second time it came out of the water vertically. I don't think it was a gray whale, so <b>I'm guessing it was a humpback</b>.  I can't tell you if it had a dorsal fin. It had fins on the sides, like arms. I don't have an estimate of length, but it did look big from my perspective. -Deborah Flynn 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:25 p.m. -</b> Sighted what I think was a minke off Prospect Point in Colvos heading north. Solitary, shiny black with smal dorsal....We see humpbacks fairly often, so I'm quite certain it wasn't one of them. It was very close to shore directly in front of our house or I would have assumed it was one. Flat water and not raining, so very visible. At one surface event, we (my wife and I) saw its head peek through the surface and I'd estimate the distance between head &amp; dorsal to be 8-10, so probably too large to be a dolphin. -Clif Alferness

Unidentified killer whales - <b>Orca sighting Jan 22, 2018, 0820 - between Knapp and Piers islands off Swartz Bay. Saw 4 or 5 orca</b> as ferry was leaving Swartz Bay, Vancouver Island. They were just lolling about at the surface and forced 2 Gulf Island ferries to actually stop. One was slapping a pectoral on the water, there was a lot of splashing, and otherwise they swam in circles for about 10 minutes (feeding?)... there was much activity including short dives. 2 adults and a smaller one stayed quite close together. They moved over beside Knapp Isl when my outgoing ferry came through the narrow passage at Clive Island (they were by the red marker). Sighting was made from outgoing Gulf Islands ferry. -Frank Gee

<b>Whale sighting (I believe humpback) @ 1250 today at North Beach about 3/4 of a mile west of Deception Pass bridge</b>. Surfaced 3 times. Last time we saw it, it seemed to be heading west in between Deception Island and North Beach. it was pretty close to the cliffs on the beach. We were at the State Park amphitheater entrance, just on the beach and it was right there. -Briana Boese

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - January 15 - <b>Admiralty Inlet - We saw them too from Ebey's Landing</b> on Whidbey! They had one baby with them. I couldn't see any markings. Too far away. It appeared to be <b>4-6 </b>together....far away so pretty pixelated.

Southern Residents - January 14 - ...The whales were extremely spread out. <b>J27</b> was foraging in the tide rips off the point and was engaged in at least one fish chase. He was staying down a long time and was surfacing irregularly so he was hard to get a photo of. There was a juvenile foraging in the same general area that <b>may have been J45</b> but he was even harder to keep track of and disappeared un-photographed. There were no other whales in sight. Around 1015, J27 looked finally committed to heading northeast up Boundary Pass which was fortunate as there was a big fog bank in Swanson Channel. Another bull finally appeared almost a mile west of J27 and this turned out to be <b>L87</b>. -See full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 2.

Molly's first orca encounter! Members of the <b>T90s &amp; T100s passing under the iconic Space Needle</b> on their way out of <b>Elliot bay</b> after traveling inbound along the downtown Seattle waterfront and exiting closer to the West Seattle side where Molly and many of us stood in awe.

January 13 - <b>Elliott Bay, Puget Sound - At about 3:30 saw what looked like a male, female and baby</b> (our very uneducated guesses) in the channel off of Rolling Bay Walk on Bainbridge heading north. -Diane Van Summern Bachen

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:35 p.m. -</b> Jeff Hogan called...They've U-turned and now heading <b>NW out of Elliot Bay toward Bainbridge Is. 7 whales total</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:30 p.m. -</b> they have turned north. Appear to be <b>continuing northbound</b> with some directional changes...now trending NW bound. Just on outer edge of the bay. (I turned my attention to other matters...glancing up periodically. They appeared to still be in the general area as 2:30 update and trending NW)
<br/><b>2:20 p.m.</b> - they have continued NWerly, south of ferry lanes heading directionally towards<b> Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island</b>,  but are now just exiting edge of Elliot Bay. Away from Alki. <b>T90s &amp; T100s in Elliott Bay</b>! Entered closer to Magnolia, paralleled downtown Seattle waterfront, continued deep into the bay, flipped then headed back out closer to West Seattle side. Mid way you will find orcas under the Space Needle and a bit later close-ups as they depart the bay grouped up. Exiting Elliot Bay: T100, T90, and maybe T90C. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>2:10 p.m. -</b> So beautiful. In placid calm waters, they began their travels <b>out of Elliott Bay</b>, primarily in two groups separated by a short distance. Once under the Space Needle (sightline) <b>T100C</b> circled around, he then headed towards the others a up ahead. As they were all coming together they made an adjustment and aimed towards those of us lining the shores along Duwamish Head, West Seattle. One spy-hopped. Once grouped they continued westerly heading <b>out of Elliot Bay, much closer to West Seatle side</b>. A stunning pass in golden sunlight. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>9:00 a.m. - 5 or 6 orca</b>, at least 1 male and 1 or 2 babies spotted from the <b>850 Edmonds/ Kingston ferry</b>. Milling around, not going anywhere fast. We were lucky enough to see one good breach unfortunately I didn't get it on film. When we first spotted them they were closer to the Kingston side just north of the ferry lane, as we got closer they were probably 200 or 300 yards from the ferry. When we last saw them they were closer to the Edmonds shore....I'd say south bound. From the pictures I got looks like closed saddle patches, but I'll look at the photos on my computer when I get home. -Terri Barnett

January 9 - <b>Departure Bay - 03:15 PM</b> - Hi! I am very excited to report my first Orca sighting. I spotted a group of <b>5 or 6 heading right into Departure Bay</b>. As the bay is shallow and small, I awaited their return to open water. About 20 minutes later I watched them from Stephenson Point as they exited the bay and made their way north, close to the shore. I have some pics that aren't great but may help you to identify them. I hope so! One was very little. -Deidre Steward

When I moved to Seattle 2.5 years ago all I could hope for was to see these amazing animals in the wild. I thought I was never going to get lucky enough to see something like I saw today. I cried. At least twice. This network of people made it possible. And to the people at Point Robinson that told me where to go, let me chase them along the beach &amp; use their binoculars, I am forever grateful.

My swim group at <b>Alki</b> spotted what we believe was <b>a humpback whale around 9:30am</b> this morning heading towards <b>Vashon</b>. The colors on the underbelly match a humpback as well as the fluke match what we saw. Would love to see if there are any other reports of humpbacks in the area to confirm if it was that or a gray!...The one we saw was smaller and we were shocked to see it so close to the Alki bathhouse, maybe only 150-200 yards away. It came up to the surface, went under again, gave us a beautiful display of the fluke, and spouted several times as it swam towards the Alki Point Lighthouse. -Melissa Kegler

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - January 1 - Active Pass - There were<b> a couple of whales heading west through the Pass around 4 pm</b> too! What a sweet way to start the New Year. Seen from the shore of <b>Galiano Island between 10 and 11 am, two groups of orcas</b> went west through Active Pass, hunted awhile around Helen Point and then came back eastward through the Pass. Hope this year is a better year for the orcas. Happy New Year. -Karoline Cullen

January 1- San Juan Channel - Starting the new year off with a beautiful group of <b>transient killer whales complete with three new calves</b>. We found the <b>T49As (including T49A2, but with T49A1 still off galavanting around), the T75Bs, and the T75Cs just as the sunset with the Olympic rising in the distance. T49As, T75Bs, and T75Cs (cool so be able to say it's the 75Cs, plural!)</b>. They were found at <b>Reuben Tarte and we left them at sunset in Griffin Bay</b>, out from Jakles still heading down towards Cattle, but deep in the bay. The three new babies were all present and looked good. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

January 1- Haro Strait - Staying at house just north of<b> Eagle Pt on San Juan Island</b>. We stepped outside not long after midnight to see if we could hear the fireworks that we were watching across the straight. Yes, we heard fireworks, but we also <b>heard whales breathing</b>. They had just come around Eagle Pt, heading north. Not far off shore, we could <b>see dorsal fins in the light of the full moon. Probably 4-5 orcas</b>, could not tell gender. They passed by in about 5-7 minutes. Happy New Year! -Lynn Dietz with Grant &amp; Megan Marshall
