<b>4:20 pm -</b> Leaving the orca, they are still moving steadily <b>southward along Bainbridge</b>, might make Eagle harbor before dark. Happy New Year!
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:55 -</b> Directly east of <b>Pt. Monroe (north end of Bainbridge Is.)</b> starting to move south now.
<br/>Lance King
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:54 - </b>Pod has picked up the pace and heading <b>south along Bainbridge</b>. Probably at about Fay Bainbridge park.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:45 -</b> research boat left and they are still milling around the same area possibly moving south at a snails pace.
<br/>Whitney Neugebauer
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:35 -</b> Currently way out mid channel next small boat <b>NE of Pt. Monroe (north bainbridge) </b>and North Beach on the Seattle. Now heading south.
<br/>Lance King 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:45 -</b> They have moved more west, still just <b>off port Madison, slow movement SW.</b> Acting more like residents but low number is throwing me off. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:16 -</b> they are mid channell <b>between Richmond Beach and out from port Madison</b>. Little spread out still southerly but have slowed out there. Looks like a research boat with them. Maybe 8 Orca with all sizes, one mature male, and a very young one.  
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:50 -</b> I just saw them from the ferry! Anyone know of a good beach to look for them on the Kingston side?
<br/>William Byrne Drumm
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:55 -</b> they have turned and are heading south at a good pace.
<br/><b>12:50 -</b> still milling in same area, a wee bit more to north, but still off the point.  
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/> 
Mom &amp; baby, I think! - shortly before noon, one mile north of the ferry, Kingston.
<br/>Shirley Bomgaars<b>
<br/>*<br/>  
11:46 am -</b> John Rogstad of WA State Ferries relayed a call from the ferry captain of <b>4 orcas, one male, two smaller and one very small orca</b>, actively milling and splashing off <b>Apple Cove Point, near Kingston</b>, for the past 90 minutes.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:40 -</b> Wow, they have been doing cartwheels, breaching, lunging, along with all that milling for the last hour in that same spot. So excellent!
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:26 - </b>Another report from Anthony Wolke on the ferry: <b>5 orcas are milling and foraging off Apple Cove Pt., near Kingston</b>, possibly going slowly southward.
<br/>*<br/> 
Another orca update - are they moving south or north now? I noticed a pod of <b>orcas between Kingston and Edmonds today at 10:30 moving south</b>. Some spy hops, a few large breeches, lots of spouting. They got as far south as the oil docks and then headed north again. People coming off the ferry said there was one large male, a few females and 3-4 juveniles.
<br/>Casey Burns, Kingston, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:52 -</b> my friend just texted me from the <b>kingston ferry</b>. He said they "put on quite a show." lucky...
<br/>Shane Farnor
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:35am -</b> I see tail lobbing, breaches and maybe lunge feeding just north of <b>Kingston ferry lane</b>. 
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:18 am -</b> At least <b>three Orcas off South Eglon</b>, west of the shipping lanes. They seem to be heading South and seem to be feeding on the way. Looks like a male, a female and maybe a baby.
<br/>TOM BANKS
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:45 am -</b> Byron Faber called Orca Network reporting <b>5-6 orcas headed south past Pilot Point, near Kingston</b> this morning.

<a href="http://www.cascadiaresearch.org/sightings_of_risso-30Dec2011.htm">Sightings of Risso's dolphins in southern Puget Sound - 30 December 2011</a>
<br/>Kim Merriman reported a sighting to Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia of some unidentified dolphin/whales at the entrance to Eld Inlet on 30 December 2011. She was able to obtain some distant photographs of the animals, two of which are shown below. These were identified as likely juvenile Risso's dolphins by John Calambokidis at Cascadia. Risso's dolphins are fairly common off the Washington coast especially along the continental slope but their occurrence in Puget Sound in extremely rare and unusual. At least two previous reports going back almost a month of unidentified large dolphins or small whales could have been these same animals so it is possible these have been around for a few weeks.
Southern Puget Sound has seen a previously undescribed diversity of species in 2010 and 2011. This has included the return of harbor porpoise in increasing numbers far south in the sound and sightings and strandings of more tropical southern species including Bryde's whales, bottlenose dolphins, and a long-beaked common dolphin (who remains in the area).
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb just called (<b>11:16 am</b>) to say at least some Js are headed north <b>up Haro Strait</b>, past the Center for Whale Research. It's windy and solid whitecaps and he only saw a few dorsal fins but could ID some J pod whales.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:26 am - Calls at Lime Kiln!!!</b> The group included <b>J and K pod members</b>. The calls were echoing and sounded a mile or two away from Lime Kiln. I also heard some echolocation at 10:34 am.
<br/>Meg McDonald
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:26 am -</b> <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> - Sounds like <b>J Pod</b> is here.

Volunteers from the <b>Point Vicente</b> Interpretive Center spotted <b>killer whales near a fin whale</b> on Tuesday. We tried to get out with the killer whales off Pt. Vicente today, but they disappeared into the sun glare 30 minutes before we arrived on the scene; they had been with a fin whale - slowly headed west.

I just IDed some of the <b>KWs off Ventura CA</b> on 12/23 as the <b>CA51s</b>, heading this way; maybe they were the ones involved with the fin whale interaction.

I am reporting a sighting of a pod of orcas in <b>Big Sur CA</b> this morning. The approximate location is N 36.19975, W 121.730325 just south of sea lion cove. There were <b>3 adult females and one calf</b> and they were attacking or 'bullying' 2 adult gray whales. The attack happened about 300 meters from shore and about 500 meters from where I was standing along Highway 1. They left and swam south after about 10 minutes of interaction with the grays. I believe once they were about a mile off shore they got a sea lion, there were about 100 gulls flying around and the orcas were splashing a lot. This was at Torre Canyon, approximately: N 36.188113, W 121.732424 where there is a deep submarine canyon. I didn't notice any distinguishing marks on any of the females. I first saw them at <b>8:50 am</b> and then saw the possible sea lion kill at about 9:20 am. They were still traveling about a mile off shore and following the coastline south. The last time I saw them was at <b>10:20 am</b> at about Mc Way Falls (N 36.156865, W 121.697288). I have photos that I can send if you would like, but I have not put them on my computer yet.

<b>10:30 am -</b> This morning I saw <b>four Orcas in Discovery Bay, off Diamond Point</b>, heading north.
<br/>Richard Isherwood, Port Townsend WA
<br/><br/>
<b>December 19, 2011</b>
<br/><br/> 
We had an encounter on Jim Maya's boat with the <b>T49As and T49Bs</b> near <b>Kelp Reef</b> where they did kill one harbor seal.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit
<br/>*<br/>
<b>T49a's and T49b's...... Along with T49c</b> !!!!!!
<br/>Jeff Lamarche
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:24pm - 10 transients off Victoria</b>. Got the report from jeff Lamarche.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:00 noon</b> - Just got calls from Jeanne Hyde &amp; Jim Maya---<b>Transients off the west side (San Juan Is.)</b> heading north!!!
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/> 
At<b> 11:15 a.m</b>. I was watching a <b>transient adult male</b> about <b>100 feet from shore</b>, I believe. Of course I'll post the whole story on my blog.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/>*<br/>
<b>07:16 - faint transient calls</b>.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/><br/>
<b>December 18, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>4-5 pm </b>ish - [Orcas]!! @ <b>Orcas Island Ferry Terminal</b>.
<br/>Kathryn Wunnicke
<br/>*<br/>
Saw <b>orcas </b>at the <b>North end of San Juan channel </b>today at <b>noon</b>. 
<br/>Rick Plath
<br/>*<br/>
At least a <b>half-dozen orcas</b> today at Pt. Caution, <b>northwest of Friday Harbor</b> ... heading Northwest up San Juan Channel at <b>11:10am</b>. One baby. One spy-hop!
<br/>Kevin Hillstrom
<br/>*<br/>
<b>05:07 </b>- clear<b> J Pod calls</b>, though faint, beginning on<b> Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/><br/>
<b>December 17, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Note:</b> <i>NOAA's NW Fisheries Science Center and the Center for Whale Research have confirmed that on December 17, <b>39-year old J16 (Slick) gave birth to a new baby calf in Puget Sound</b>, probably only a few hours judging from the fresh fetal folds, before being seen and photographed by veteran field researcher Candice Emmons of NWSFC. This makes J16's fifth calf since her first, J26, was born in 1991. She was the sixteenth J pod orca photographed and identified by Mike Bigg in 1972, and is among the oldest whose age is known exactly. Her matriline is known as the J7's after J16's late mother.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>two orca's right off Titlow Beach (off Tacoma) </b>heading towards the Narrows Saturday Dec 17 @ about <b>9:00am</b>. We thought possibly mamma and baby or teen due to the difference in their size. This sighting was a long time in coming and most overwhelming. As a result I was a little delayed in grabbing my cell phone and missed the window for pics!
<br/>Paige Van Der Vliet
<br/>*<br/>
Still very <b>audible at 11:55</b> (on<b> Port Townsend hydrophones</b>) until the boat drowned them out. Such a privilege to hear those beauties after spending the day watching them.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
Lots of <b>calls still on PT hydros</b>.....definite <b>K Pod calls and a few Js</b> in there too.....not hearing any Ls though.....
<br/>John Boyd
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2300 </b>- Just began hearing a lot of <b>calls &amp; whistles on the PT hydrophones</b>, with a lot of other noise as well - not sure who, but likely the Js &amp; Ks that were in Puget Sound today.
<br/>Susan Berta
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2241 - faint SRKW calls (on PT phones)</b>.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/>*<br/>
<b>18:22</b> - clearly <b>transient calls now - Lime Kiln Hydrophones
<br/>17:35 - Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b> - began hearing high pitched sounds every two to three minutes... still continuing.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde
<br/>*<br/>
The unofficial word from Brad Hanson of NOAA is that <b>Js, Ks and L87 were still together in Puget Sound</b> today. The last he saw of them was around <b>4:10 pm</b> as they were still "trending" NW <b>toward Admiralty inlet from Possession Point</b>, Whidbey Island, but he said he wouldn't be surprised if they turned around again.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:45 pm - </b>Can see the <b>orcas </b>now from <b>Dave Mackie County Park on Whidbey</b>. They're to the southwest and look closer to the Kitsap side. Far off, but close enough to see sprays with the naked eye
<br/>Jon Scanlon
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:00 pm - Orcas</b> spotted off <b>Mayne Island lighthouse</b>; coming <b>from Georgia Strait into Active Pass</b>. I'm assuming J pod; I missed them by 15 minutes. ):
<br/>Deborah Simpson
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:42 pm -</b> Brad Hanson and Lori Wilson say the <b>orcas have turned westward</b> toward Admiralty Inlet.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:24 -</b> Southside of<b> Whidbey off Posession Pt</b>, generally heading north into Posession sound.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:19 - </b>Lori Wilson says they are still heading <b>toward Possession Point</b>, but she still can't tell if they'll go up Saratoga Passage or Admiralty Inlet.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:55 pm -</b> Brad Hanson called to say the <b>orcas </b>seem to be angling <b>NE toward Saratoga Passage</b>, but it's still too early to tell for sure.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:43 -</b> they are nearing <b>Scatchet head, Cutlus Bay, Whidbey Island</b>.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:38 -</b> Lori Wilson called to say she sees <b>orcas heading north from north of Edmonds</b>, but it's too ealy to tell if they'll go up Saratoga Passage or Admiralty Inlet.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:28 -</b> they are moving towards Whidbey <b>in the direction of Useless Bay</b> but still out in middle of the sound. Hard to say if they'll go around Posession or up the inlet. 
One of the most interesting actions of the day (besides breaches and tail lobs) was about noon when the lead 6-7 ( young ones included) orca turned rather quickly (from northern end of Edmonds) and porpoised really fast back southward to the group that was near NOAA research boat. The pod then stayed in a very tight group for at least 1 hour as they (and the research boat) moved slowly north. We were thinking an elder gave them a shout out to join the group for whatever reason.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:25 - </b>That northerly group looks to have turned south or west or just feeding in circles. : )
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:37 -</b> still grouped drifting northward, mid channel <b>between Edmonds &amp; Eglon</b> (Kitsap).
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:10 - </b>Seeing some way out off <b>Edmonds</b>.
<br/>Kathy Wahl 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:05 -</b> Many off <b>Kingston </b>heading north.
<br/>Cindie Lang 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>12:05 -</b>  Watching them off in the distance, half way<b> between Edmonds and Kingston</b>, still going north. 
<br/>William Byrne Drumm
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:30 -</b> One group of at least 6 closer to <b>Edmonds </b>side moving slowly north, kind of towards Posession Pt.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:45 am -</b> Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC called from the <b>Edmonds/Kingston ferry lane</b> - the orcas have turned around and headed back south!
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:19 am -</b> WA State Ferries called to relay a report from a deck hand of a <b>pod of orca surrounding the Edmonds ferry dock</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:15 -</b> 2 more mid channel heading northish pointing toward <b>Kingston</b>.
<br/>Cindie Lang 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:10 -</b> Just spotted <b>three orcas, just off Richmond Beach</b>, headed north towards Point Wells then <b>Edmonds</b>. 
<br/>Dave Haas 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:05 - </b>Between <b>Richmond beach and Jefferson head</b>. Mid channel. Have seen 2 big one little. Slightly moving north.
<br/>Cindie Lang
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11am 4 Orca whales</b> ..including a baby.. spotted of <b>Richmond Beach</b> heading North.
<br/>Denise Guerrero, King 5 News
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>inbound <b>East Sooke Park @ 11am</b>. Resting, too far for ID, about 20 animals. Should be at Race by now.
<br/>Brandon Harvey
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:56 am in Malaspina Strait</b>, on the east side of Georgia Strait, north of Vancouver, BC, Tony McGinnis just reported a group of<b> 5-6 orcas</b> heading SE, toward Vancouver.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:15 -</b> Direction northerly, some making good time with foraging along the way.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:58 - </b>Alisa Brooks called to say she found the <b>orcas</b>, right about where the Clipper had them at 8:20, between <b>Richmond Beach and Port Madison</b>, north of Seattle in Puget Sound, still generally possibly heading north, but not making much progress.
<br/>*<br/>
The Victoria Clipper IV reports that at <b>8:20 am J pod </b>is heading north in <b>Puget Sound between Shilshoal and Jefferson Head</b>, very active, spyhopping, breaching, and possibly feeding.
<br/><br/>
<b>December 16, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Went back out for one last try at seeing the whales. At <b>4:10 pm </b>I saw some just south of<b> Lagoon Pt</b>, others further south, nearly to Bush Pt. So I headed down to Bush Pt, and at about <b>4:30 </b>saw a pod over closer to the Marrowstone Island side, a breach/splash, then a freighter went past &amp; blocked the view for awhile. Then, just as I was about to pack it in, here comes a pod passing much <b>closer to the Bush Pt. side </b>- yay!! They were moving fast, &amp; I tried to get photos but since it was so dark &amp; I didn't have time to set up the tripod they are blurry, but it was nice to have a close pass by just before dark! There were more spouts down toward Pt. No Point, so they seem to be<b> continuing south</b> - let us know if you hear any blows out there tonight! Who knows where they will show up tomorrow~
<br/>Susan Berta
<br/>*<br/>
Just got home to Everett from Whidbey...THANKS for the <b>Bush Point</b> suggestion Orca Network-- I finally got to see them! Sounds like I should have hung around a bit longer to see them closer, but it was still very cool. There was <b>one big male</b> with a really tall dorsal. And several <b>smaller groups of 3 or 4</b>. They were pretty spread out, but lots of action.
<br/>Pam Ren
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:10 pm -</b> Susan just called from <b>Lagoon Pt</b>. to say there are still more <b>orcas in mid-channel heading south</b>, including at least one male.
<br/>*<br/>
Cold, hungry, thirsty but VERY happy (it doesn't take much) after spending four hours observing some of our endangered southern residents in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>. My last sighting was at <b>4.00 pm </b>at <b>Bush Point</b> when I watched one male, a Mum and calf and a couple of other females/juveniles pass by before they disappeared into the fading light - and who knows where? Note that Susan, a little further up at Lagoon Point, was still seeing whales approaching.
<br/>Sandy Pollard
<br/>*<br/>
Kathy Webb called from <b>Lagoon Point at 3:10</b> to say there were at least <b>5 or 6 orcas</b> heading south in mid-channel, including at least two babies.

We live on the west side of Mill Bay <b>(Saanich Inlet, north of Victoria BC)</b>, and although not frequent, we have sighted Orcas in the Bay. There was a pod back in August, and we have also seen them in May. Thursday 15 December we spotted what <b>at first seemed to be a lone male</b>. He was swimming slowly in a circle, and not quartering the area as they seem to do when searching for food. After a while we, got glimpses of <b>a smaller (female?) inside the male's circle</b>. They were closer to the Saanich side of the Bay, so even with good binoculars, it was not easy to see detail. But then, as they were leaving the area, a third smaller orca showed itself.

From Joslyn Gibson - her other half was on the Coho Ferry departing <b>Victoria at 4:15 pm</b>, and saw <b>a pod of orcas coming into Victoria Harbor</b> - no other details as to number of whales, etc.

<br/>Pamela Benson-Lasnetske
<br/>*<br/>
The trained volunteers for the ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project spotted <b>12 killer whales</b> about 2 miles off off <b>Point Vicente CA</b> at about <b>1:30 pm</b> today. We got on them around 2 pm and confirmed them as transients: the <b>CA51s, the CA50s, and the CA140s</b>. They killed at least one sea lion, and were VERY surface-active: breaches, spyhops, headstands, close approaches - and mating!'' They were last sighted at about sunset heading very slowly eastward, still surface-active. The CA51s were the active group seen yesterday off Ventura, based on the images that Luke Dutton posted on the Island Packers Facebook; Luke and Captain Anthony Lombardi enjoyed watching them from the Islander.

<b>8-9 ORCAS</b> 4 MILES OFFSHORE IN BETWEEN VENTURA HARBOR AND SCORPION RANCH, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND CA, 80-100FT DEPTH OF WATER, going SLOWLY SOUTH, 10AM, PLAYING, MATING, ONE LARGE MALE WAS REPEATEDLY ROLLING OVER AND MOUNTING OTHER WHALES, ONE SMALLER ORCA HAD A LARGE FIN IN ITS MOUTH. I HAVE A PICTURE OF THIS, ONE LARGE (25FT + MALE), SEVERAL MID SIZE AND A FEW VERY SMALL CALVES. ONE HAD A SHALLOW CUT ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY UP ITS DORSAL FIN ON THE FRONT AND WAS HEAVILY SCARRED ON ITS BODY IN FRONT OF ITS DORSAL FIN.

<b>6:16 PM:</b> In the same spots that we have been seeing all of the humpback feeding activity just offshore of <b>Ventura Harbor CA</b>, four miles. We saw our first couple of spouts but alas they were from <b>a large group of Orcas</b> today! It was one of the best shows of these animals I have seen, there were at least 4 calfs and a maybe three females and a large male. They weren't moving in any particular direction, and then we found out why when Pink Floyd came on the stage and put a show on, multiple times. We ended up drifting with them and had a great show under the bow and playing with the passengers for over half an hour. There were some great pics and video taken, some will be posted on the Island Packers facebook site soon.  The most amazing thing captured by our crew Luke on video was the calves vocalizing to us. The female brought the calf over to the boat and it lifted its head out of the water and started vocalizing and it was really neat to hear. There was a total of at least nine. We tried to find them on the way back this afternoon but to no avail. Early start to the season.

<b>Five orcas</b> were reported just<b> north of Nanaimo BC</b> this morning. According to Lon Kamann, they were headed north in Northwest Bay at<b> 9:45 am</b>, near about 50 sea lions, which were "going crazy." There was one male in the group, and possibly one baby. Sounds like transients.

<b>5 Transients in Monterey Bay</b>, the <b>CA138s, CA217 (Chopfin), and CA171b</b> together. They successfully hunted a large harbor seal about <b>7 miles SW of Moss Landing CA</b>. 
<br/>Kate Cummings
<br/>*<br/>
We had another amazing encounter with <b>the same transient pod that has been in the Bay for eight days now</b>, which includes the large male "Chop Top". Today the pod was joined by another large male. Today they attacked and <b>beat up a harbor seal</b> for at least fifteen minutes prior to killing and eating it. They injured it immediately and it was bleeding profusely, yet it hung on at the surface while they repeatedly tail whacked it and dragged it around and pushed it about. It was a very active and prolonged kill event, with the orcas surging in tight circles around the seal.  There was plenty of partial breaches and tail lobs. It appeared that the <b>adults were letting the younger animals practice their techniques</b>. The coordinates were approximately 36.46.5N and 121.54.0W

Out with Capt. Spencer, Legacy Charters. We encountered <b>several transients at 1:55 pm</b>, heading west. When first spotted they were approximately a mile south and 
<b>a mile east of Race Rocks</b>. There were <b>at least 4, possibly 5</b>, animals, no adult males in the group. At the same time, behind this group by a couple miles and a bit farther to the south, heading west, were what appeared to be, <b>4 more</b>, including one large male. We stayed with the first group for a while, leaving them moving rapidly west. We did not find the second group (hence no proof of who it actually was). Then, on the way back, at four and a half miles south of Victoria, we saw <b>more transient whales</b>. There were <b>5 or 6 and no adult males</b>. We stayed just long enough to get some photos and left them heading east at 3:15 pm. I will post more of the story with pictures on my blog Whale of A Purpose.

One of our volunteers works on Princess <b>Monterey Whale Watch</b> and said they saw <b>5 to 6 Orcas</b>. One with dorsal fin missing so most likely it was "Stumpy" plus there was another male with the group. According to another whale watch boat they had killed a sea lion before the Princess got to the area. If indeed it was "Stumpy" then it would have been the same group as seen last weekend in the same area, only yesterday another male was with them. Probably the one that is occasionally seen with them.

I understand that <b>both J and K pods were in Saratoga Passage</b> yesterday, Dec. 1 about 4 PM? Whoever they were, it was QUITE a show. I was part of the lucky group down on the beach at Camano Island State Park.  A number of the orcas were feeding close to the beach, along a tide line. Obviously good fishing!  While watching those close to shore, we would also sight a number of orcas over toward Baby Island, and across Saratoga Passage toward Greenbank, including a few tall fins.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>*<br/>
We saw the <b>orcas from 1:45 to 3:30</b>, and more were coming after that, mostly across Saratoga Passage, but with the leaders 8 to ten miles ahead of the last ones. There was very little play or splashing, but several direction changes.

At Cama Beach State Park, we watched <b>10-15 orcas heading North up Saratoga Passage</b>. Sightings occurred over at least a two hour period. They were very spread out in small unidentified groups of three to five with at least two males. The males were seen perhaps an hour apart. Orcas also seen here in the past.
