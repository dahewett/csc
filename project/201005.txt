<h3><center>May 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>May 31, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
We were surprised today to find a couple <b>Transients </b>just south of the north arm of the <b>Fraser river</b>, just outside the harbour of <b>Vancouver</b>. They were milling around for a while and ended up playing with a seal for a while before finishing the kill. It was a great day but frustrating because I couldn't seem to ID these 2 whales. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/><i>From the Center for Whale Research: The whale with the little nick is 124C, but the one with the injury near the trailing edge of the fin is not known to us. Dave gave it his best. Ken</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Zimmerman saw <b>T40 </b>heading south in <b>Rosario Strait</b> from Sharpe Park, Fidalgo Island, just south of Anacortes, at <b>3:30 pm</b>
<br/>*<br/>
This trio, <b>T40</b>, the big guy with the "hooked" dorsal, and <b>T86A and T86A2</b>, were spotted yesterday in the morning down near <b>Cattle Pass</b> after being seen near Pt. Townsend yesterday. They spent the day munching their way from Cattle Pass, into San Juan Ch., almost into Friday Harbor, then up towards Waldron, passing on the north side of Waldron. Most of their kills were seals, though it seemed that they might have taken a porpoise down near Whale Rocks. We left them at dusk almost <b>between Sucia and Patos Islands</b>, headed northeast.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside 
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Peirson called in a sighting of <b>T40 </b>and two other <b>transient orcas</b> at <b>Fidalgo Head, Fidalgo Island</b>, heading south at <b>1:30 pm</b>. He said they were at East Point, Island BC, at 7 pm on May 30.
<br/>*<br/>
While headed to Anacortes at <b>5:30 this afternoon</b> we passed a small group of <b>Orcas </b>just north of Spencer Spit on <b>Lopez</b>. There was one adult male with a droop to the top of his dorsal (anyone other than Captain Hook have one of those?). He was accompanied by 2-3 companions.
<br/>Tom Reeve
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Three orcas</b> were trucking past Lions Bay (north of <b>Vancouver BC</b>, several miles inside Horseshoe Bay) yesterday at about <b>7 pm</b> heading north fairly rapidly.
<br/>Lawrence Ruskin 
<br/>*<br/> 
On the afternoon 'Goldwing' tour, Vanessa and I traveled way over into <b>Rosario Strait</b> where we encountered <b>3 Transient Killer Whales</b> in Thatcher Pass. The whales were found to be <b>T-40 (Captain Hook), T-86A and T-86A1</b>. The animals were traveling close together swimming to the Northwest towards Upright Head Lopez Island. During our stay with these Transients we got very lucky as the adult female, T-86A, swam right over to us and went just below our vessel !!!! As she swam right under our vessel we could see her arch her head up to look at us. Once across to the other side of the boat she swam around the stern and then came up the other side all the while she was swimming on her side staring at the passengers on the back viewing platform of the boat. She was obviously doing a little people watching.... Absolutely amazing encounter with these 3 animals. T-86A has a satellite tag on her right side of her dorsal fin, which allows the researchers to track this group of whales as they swim all through the waters of the Pacific Northwest. These Transients average over 100 miles (160 km/h) per day !!!!
<br/>Jeff Lamarche, Captain/Biologist, Eagle Wing Tours
<br/>*<br/> 
Nancy Zaretzke saw <b>a gray whale</b> near Hidden Beach, <b>Whidbey Island</b> at <b>5 pm</b>, moving slowly north. She reported there were many feeding pits in the mudflats at low tide there.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Transients are the new Residents. At least when it comes to being around in May! We had two trips and got to see two different groups of <b>Transients</b>! As we left the dock, we had reports of <b>T40 Captain Hook and T86A &amp; T86A2 </b>just at the bottom of <b>San Juan Island</b>. But before we left the harbor, we got a call that there was also a group of <b>12 Transients just north of Eastpoint</b>. So Captain Ivan decided to head north even though it meant a longer trip, and it was worth it! The waters were pretty calm and at first we spotted what turned out to be <b>T87</b>. Soon we were close enough to watch the larger group of transients all coming to the surface at the same time as they made their way up Georgia Strait. And wouldn't you know it, by the time we got back to Friday Harbor, we had the opportunity to get a quick viewing of T40 as he passed right past the entrance to Friday Harbor. Our second trip of the day was much shorter, as T40 and gang had not made much headway. We watched as the group continued up <b>San Juan Channel</b>, then turned towards <b>Presidents Channel</b>, and then turned again towards Point Disney on Waldron. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Explorer, Friday Harbor
<br/>*<br/> 
At <b>1300 </b>the <b>Ts </b>were heading NW off the <b>Belle Chain</b> in two groups at first. <b>T87 and T88</b> were traveling together. <b>T100s </b>(without T100D born in 2006), <b>T124s</b> and others made up the main group. They were travelling at approx. 3 knots with whale watch companies and a couple of pleasure boaters following. Long dives of 4 to 5 minutes . At approx. 1400 the T100s split from the group. T100E was seen staying close to mom T100. This baby frequently surfaces on her back. The male T87, born about 1963, has very visible wounds on the top of both sides of the dorsal fin (most likely tooth rakes). Only activity observed for the afternoon was travelling as they continued NW passed Poirier Pass at <b>1730</b>.
<br/>Peter Hamilton
<br/>*<br/>
Jeffry Gottfried called to report a sighting of <b>4 orcas</b> about 100 yards from the beach at <b>Cannon Beach OR</b>, at <b>5 pm</b>. He thought at least two looked like males.
<br/>*<br/>
I know it was not an Orca. There was no dorsal visible and the body was molted black and gray. So this could be a possible gray. Sighted around N49 00.000 W123 44.014. Heading North - North East up Stuart Channel. Slow moving, we first spotted it at 16:20, as we were approaching Ladysmith - approx 5 miles out - heading in the same direction as we were. It then turned NE towards Yellow Point. It would surface about every 5 to 10 minutes before diving. No tail was ever shown us. Only noticed one. We have seen Orcas in the area before, but not Grays. Hope this helps.
<br/>Rick Ruppenthal, Chemainus, BC 
<br/>*<br/>
Our favourite group of T's were around again today. They are becoming more resident than the residents these days. Light was a little better than on Friday. We were fortunate to once again locate <b>transient orcas in the Strait of Georgia</b>, east of the Belle Chain Islands, shortly after noon. As we arrived on scene, a few of them were milling, and there were many seagulls picking at scraps, so we must have arrived during lunch again. With the meal over, the group headed northwest, eventually catching up to a larger group of approx 6 animals. Two others, <b>T87 and T88</b>, were off to the east, keeping in range of the big group, but separate. For the remainder of our viewing, the large group of the <b>T100's, T124, T124D, T124E, T90 and T90B</b> surfaced close together approximately every 5 minutes, for 5 breaths or so, as they continued to travel in a northwesterly direction. We last saw them heading towards <b>Georgeson Island</b>.
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Jim Maya called in a sighting of <b>transients </b>including <b>T40 and T86A</b> &amp; B heading east at <b>8:25PM </b>between <b>Patos and Sucia Islands</b>, south Strait of Georgia, 
<br/>*<br/>
A Seattle friend, walking on Edgecliff in <b>Langley </b>early this morning about <b>6 am</b>, heard, then saw, <b>3 Orcas </b>swimming south in Saratoga Passage! 
<br/>Julie Buktenica 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Gray </b>in very shallow water giving <b>Bell's Beach</b> a feeding show for nearly an hour before heading North. I have pic of pec fins- was hoping to find link to ID on Cascadia or your home page, but could only find sides.
<br/>Kathy Carr
<br/><i>This is the same gray whale that was feeding in Greenbank May 27 - see photo below - but don't have the ID from Cascadia just yet. Veronica Allworden has some pec shots with IDs -hg</i>
<br/>*<br/>
I was getting into my waders this morning around <b>5:30</b>, enjoying the sunrise and eagles talking when I heard a familiar blow. I watched one <b>gray whale </b>feeding on ghost shrimp for about 20 minutes in close to shore just east of <b>Langley</b>.

<br/><br/>
Orca Network received a call from Nate Stansbury, reporting a sighting of <b>orcas </b>off <b>Coos Bay, OR</b>, <b>7 am</b>. 2 orcas, including 1 adult male, sighted crossing the bar off Coos Bay, OR heading N. 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>7 PM</b> <b>one gray whale</b> was feeding along the shoreline ½ mile east of <b>Baby Island</b>. It made one resting trip out to deeper water, came back in for a few mores bites, and then steamed east down <b>Saratoga Passage</b>.
<br/>Roger Clark 
<br/>*<br/>
I was out at <b>Lime Kiln</b> yesterday around <b>5:00pm</b>, despite the less than wonderful weather--I've been trying to get out there every weekend because I've been dying to spot the whales and only have a little longer to live on the island. We had only been there for 20 minutes when I saw a group of <b>4-5 orcas</b> surface fairly close to shore. There were two larger ones and two or three smaller ones and they surfaced a few times in front of us. We kept watching and saw them again off in the distance--they appeared to be heading toward Victoria. 
<br/>Amanda Moulton
<br/>*<br/>
Jon McKenzie called Orca Network with a sighting of <b>8-10 orcas</b> north of <b>Port Angeles</b>, at Lat. 48.10.7, Long. 123.25.9, at <b>7:15 AM</b>. They were meandering slowly to the west. 
<br/>*<br/>
Liam Reese heard <b>Orcas </b>on the <b>Orcasound hydrophones</b> at <b>1830 </b>and saw at least one male &amp; two female orcas traveling N in Haro Strait. 
<br/>*<br/>
Chris Kennedy of WA State Ferries called to relay a sighting of a male, female and calf <b>orca </b>were rounding <b>Point Hudson, Port Townsend,</b> heading toward the mill at <b>1722</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Erick Pierson called and texted reports of about <b>8 transients</b> in Admiralty Inlet near <b>Port Townsend</b>. At <b>1225 </b>they were in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, at Admiralty Head, southbound. At <b>1:10pm</b> Midchannel headed to Pt. Hudson. then: North turn, to Pt. Wilson. Then they were approaching <b>Partridge Point</b>, northbound.
At <b>6:36pm another group of transients</b> were were at Kala Pt., inside<b> Port Townsend bay</b>, south of the mill, almost to Port Hadlock.
<br/>*<br/>
Group of <b>orcas </b>between <b>Ebey's and Pt. Partridge</b> heading north with 3-4 whale-watch boats @ <b>3:45pm</b>.
<br/>Al Luneman 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>9:25</b> this morning Christina Baldwin saw <b>two orcas</b>, a male and a female, heading south down <b>Admiralty Inlet</b> closer to the Whidbey Island side.
<br/><br/>
<b>May 28, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>J's</b>, at least, maybe <b>L's</b>, were chirping up a storm on <b>Orcasound hydrophones</b> for about four hours last evening, from around <b>6 to 10 pm</b>. No cargo ships, no buzz boats, just loud and clear calls from whales in serious party mode. 
<br/>Howard, Orca Network 
<br/>*<br/>
Cathy Bacon, listening to <b>OrcaSound Hps</b> at <b>1923 </b>heard <b>Southern Resident calls</b> getting louder among tanker noise. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b>: I've been waiting a long time for this and I'm happy to report there are [<b>orcas</b>] passing by Lime Kiln. The chatter started about <b>5:50 PM</b> with some sporadic sounds in the distance. By 6:04 PM it was quiet. At about 6:11 the chatter picked up again.
<br/>Vicky Miller SSAMN Member 
<br/>*<br/>
Jeanne Hyde reported very faint <b>calls at Lime Kiln</b> at <b>1717</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Beam Reach aboard the Gato Verde reported <b>J pod</b> moving slow near Iceberg Point at <b>1214 </b>with J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny leading along S side of Lopez, foraging with many clicks and a few whistles and calls. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transients </b>today!! started out with <b>10 of them </b>and then they broke off into smaller groups, we stuck with a group of 4 that had T101 and T102 with them, in the <b>strait of georgia</b>.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
Following up on a report of orcas on the <b>east side of Galiano Island</b>, we located <b>a large group of Transients </b>travelling southeast. As we were approaching, the location of the group was apparent from some very large splashes. On arrival, the whales were milling, doing long dives, and vocalizing. Seems we may have arrived during dinner. As the group continued south, most were traveling very close together, maintaining approximately 7 knots, and occasionally porpoising. The group consisted of <b>T124, T124D, T124E, the T100's</b> and possibly another female with a calf two+ years old. Slightly further offshore, T87 was traveling with a female, presumably T88. The T100's, T124's were last seen heading south past Gossip Island, while T87 and 88 were observed heading west into Active Pass. We continued south to the Belle Chain Islets to check on the juvenile Stellar sea lions, California sea lions and harbour seals that haul out on the rocky shores. To our surprise, we encountered yet another group of T's lurking offshore of the Belle Chain. This time it was the T101's and T102. They were very spread out and appeared to be foraging, perhaps hoping to find a naive young sea lion that strayed from the haulout. Several very pregnant harbour seals wisely stayed onshore as the T's cruised past. We left this last group in the early afternoon, heading southeast in the Strait.

<b>May 27, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Late afternoon</b> on Maya's Westside Charters, we met up with <b>J pod</b> north of <b>Alden Bank</b>, Whatcom county WA, heading north. They were spread out in groups of various sizes. J17 and her two daughters seemed to be in charge of most all of the kids -J36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46 and 47. J41 and J42 were traveling with J42's mom Slick J16 and her oldest offspring Mike J26. Ruffles J1, Granny J2, Canuck L7, Spieden J8 and Keet J33 were all way ahead of the rest of the whales. Others were in small groups or surfacing individually, some very far off from the rest.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/> 
We have seen our first <b>Grey whale</b> of this year. The Whale was 8 miles west of <b>Sekiu, WA</b> heading west towards Neah Bay. First spotted directly off of Chito Beach Resort and disappeared around Ship Wreck Point about 10 minutes later. 
We usually have whale sightings on this part of the Strait of Juan De Fuca around the 15th of April.
<br/>Brian Harmon, Chito Beach Resort 
<br/>*<br/>
They're back!! It was great to see <b>J pod</b> today, vocalizing and lots of foraging going on which is always a nice sight to see. They were <b>spread very far apart</b> in the strait of georgia, east of <b>Point Roberts</b>. We spent time with <b>J16, J22, J26, J34 and J38</b> among others. 
<br/>Gary Sutton
<br/>Wild Whales Vancouver 
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Maya and Jeanne Hyde tell us <b>J1 (Ruffles), J2 (Granny), and J8 (Speiden)</b>, are all present and accounted for north of Orcas Island this evening.
<br/>*<br/>
We found some members of <b>J pod</b>, and one <b>L pod</b> whale today just south of <b>Point Roberts in the Strait of Georgia</b>. The whales were very spread out, traveling in matrilines, or as individuals. They were doing long dives, likely foraging. We were fortunate to observe one feeding event, when J16's (Slick's) family shared in the catch of a silver fish, likely a Chinook salmon. J33 (Keet) did not show up for dinner with the rest of the family - hopefully just a case of teenage independence. We also observed Rhapsody, J32, traveling with her relatives, the J22's (Oreo's matriline). J14 (Samish) and her brood were also identified. J1 (Ruffles) was way off to the south, ahead of the rest of the group, and the lone representative of L pod that we saw, L7 (Canuck), was traveling near him. Overall, it was a very peaceful encounter, on calm waters, with J Pod calls once again on the hydrophone.
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist

<br/>*<br/>
It was a bit of a rocky day out there with 2 foot swells, but it was still a great day! The Southern Resident <b>L- pod</b> was first spotted off <b>False Bay</b> on the southwest side of the island. The pod was spread out into several smaller groups. We chose to take a look at a smaller group that seemed to be frolicking in the waves. Eventually they moved offshore to slightly calmer waters and milled about. We continued along the west side of the island encountering a small pod of <b>Dall's porpoise</b>. These small black and white porpoises are often very social riding the bow wake of boats.

I live in Olalla about 3/10's of a mile from Al's. We just saw two beautiful <b>orcas </b>swim by on their way toward <b>Prospect Point</b> at <b>5 p.m.</b>  Prospect Point is off of Shoreline Drive SE. The first outcropping of low-banks homes as you head up Banner Road. They were gently cruising and wonderfully incredible. Both whales appeared to be smaller. They were swimming north right next to my house on the Olalla side of <b>Colvos Passage</b>, across from Vashon.
<br/>Robin Headrick 
<br/>*<br/> 
We saw <b>Orcas, 6-8</b> traveling North, West side of <b>Colvos Passage</b>, 1/2 mile North of Fragaria about 200 yards off shoreline. One large male with the top of his dorsal shaped with an "m" or "v "shaped grove in top of fin. the fin was about 4 or 5 feethigh. Looked like a slight, light gray area on his back at the base of his fin. There were two females and one with young baby by her side. These females looked like they had the same light gray area. We don't know if it was the reflection of the sky off the wet skin. There were <b>3 or 4 more orcas</b>: 
<br/>Suzanne and Don 
<br/>*<br/>
I was working on the south tip of <b>Bainbridge Island</b>, on South Beach Drive, when a pod of <b>Orcas </b>swam by, about <b>11AM</b> or so. There were maybe <b>4-5 adults, one with a very large dorsal fin and maybe 3-4 young ones</b>. They were swimming east. Attached are 4 pictures that I took. The homeowner also took pictures and might have better ones if you want copies. Both he and his wife said it was the first time they've ever seen Orcas swimming by.
<br/>Doug Tanaka 
<br/>*<br/>
abt <b>0715 </b>- Just saw a single tall dorsal fin followed by a blow and submergence - right off <b>Keyport </b>headed South in the channel out of <b>Liberty Bay</b>. I've seen lots of whales over the years and there's no doubt this was an Orca. No other dorsal like it!

A <b>gray whale</b> was reported by Mary Jo Stansberry in <b>Greenbank </b>today. It fed there for about two hours (<b>12:30 - 2:30</b>), back and forth along a quarter mile line about 200 yards off the beach at Wonn Road, rolling on its side in typical feeding behavior every couple of minutes. Not known is whether there was much shrimp or other good food for it there. After 2:30 it moved on northward parallel to the beach. At <b>3:45</b> Mary Pacher reported the whale off the north end of North Bluff Rd., still heading north at a good clip about 500 yards from the beach.
At <b>8:00pm</b> Mary Jo reported it back at the same beach, near Wonn Rd., so maybe there was something good there.

<br/>*<br/>
I am reporting having observed a group <b>Killer Whales</b> at approximately <b>7:30PM</b>. They were observed at Staleshin, Wilson Creek on the <b>Sunshine Coast, British Colombia</b>. They were observed very close to shore, up to a couple of hundred and predominantly 1000-2000 feet. At first all I saw was one seal suddenly rise as if standing in the water to scan the horizon. This happened repeatedly and then I observed that seal &amp; others doing the same while making haste towards shore where they remained for perhaps an hour and a half more after the whales departed southward and appeared to travel close to shore. 
At first all I saw was water stirring and then several shapes came up out of the water and at first I thought it was dolphins or porpoises and then I saw how big they all were as fins, dorsal fins and tails emerged in a seathing, circular repeated patern as well as expanding and contracting the diameter of the circle. The seals remained on high alert.
The reason I think they may have caught a seal as opposed to fish is how paranoid the seals were long after the killer whales left, and I know nothing about fish or if any are migrating in this area now.
There definitely were two very young animals in the group given the size difference. 
What really stood out was that none had a dorsal fin of any substantial size or difference in size. The dorsal fins all seemed similar in size and shape. I know there is a difference between male/female whales dorsal fins so I really tried to see the male as I thought he would stand out and I couldn't be sure because the dorsal fins were not exaggerated in any way.
It was hard to count accurately the number but I think it was 6-8/9. That would include the young ones.

Out with Capt. Jim on a <b>morning </b>trip. We were going to look for some of the transients that had been in the area and instead we came upon many members of L Pod!!! When <b>Crewser L-92, Fluke L-105 and Pooka L-106</b> surfaced one after another we were about in shock and then took several minutes to get some pics and get some IDs. I could tell there were whales from several different <b>L Pod</b> subgroups and we could see they were spread way out. The only large male we saw was L-92 and he is still a teenager. There were tails slaps, a baby breaching, an older whale breaching off in the distance and even a spyhop.

The Residents are back !!!! Finally, some of <b>L-pod</b> returned to local waters today.... The morning trip was spent off of <b>Eagle Pt.</b> with some of the <b>L-26's</b>. On the way back to the harbour, Mallard and I bumped into <b>T-20 and T-21</b>, 2.5 nm NE of Seabird Pt. (<b>Discovery Island</b>). The afternoon trip turned out even better as we had the first triple header of the year !!!! Residents, Transients and a juvenile <b>Humpback</b>, 1 nm SW of VH Buoy. The animal was moving quickly to the Southwest towards Race Rocks and was not showing any tail.

Watching the water from my living room I noticed <b>two porpoise</b> dorsal fins in the waters just off <b>Richmond Beach</b>. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. The dorsal fins were almost head-on towards me, but their coloration and shape looked more like Dall's Porpoise than Harbor Porpoise. There were definitely two of them. I saw each of their dorsal fins surface twice, nearly in tandem with one another.

We get a call that a small group of <b>Transients </b>were discovered near Anacortes in <b>Rosario Channel</b> heading towards Cypress. So off we went, and after watching a few seals and eagles, we found ourselves watching Transient groups <b>T2s and T123s</b>. They were in no hurry to go anywhere, and would spend quite a bit of time at the surface before going on a long dive. They continued northerly and there was an air of expectation as they neared the <b>Peapods </b>(a small chain of islands that are a known seal haul-out), but the transients were content to work the tide rips and continued north. We left them heading towards Lawrence Point, and we were all excited at seeing these marine predators. But our day would prove far from over as we get a call that more transients have been discovered just a short distance in front of us. And my favorite transient was in this group. <b>T40 </b>is known as <b>Captain Hook</b> for his very prominent hooked dorsal fin (the top foot makes a 180 curve to the left). T40 was traveling with 2 other transients and they actually followed us through Peavine Pass. And while they appeared to be actively hunting for something to munch on, we did not witness any kills. But it was such a treat to see this massive guy traveling along the shorelines, especially as he passed 3 immature bald eagles feasting on something along the shoreline!

<br/>*<br/> 
We got a report of <b>transient orcas</b> in <b>Rosario Strait</b> at about <b>noon</b>, when we were at the opposite end of our range. By the time we arrived on scene, they were traveling northeast along <b>Cypress Island</b>, in typical transient fashion - 5 minutes underwater followed by a breathing sequence of approximately 5 breaths. The group then turned northwest towards <b>Orcas Island</b>, eventually passing Lawrence Point. While alongside the dark shoreline, their blows were beautifully displayed. All this time they were swimming with the flood tide. A <b>minke whale</b> passed by heading southeast, against the tidal current, within approx 20 yards of the group. The minke only surfaced once while near the orcas, and was not seen again. The T's interrupted their travel momentarily, split into two groups, then continued in a northeast direction towards the Sisters Islands in the southern Strait of Georgia. No kills or chases occurred during our encounter. The group of six T's were comprised of <b>T2C, T2C1, T2C2</b> (the little whale with the wavy fin), and tentatively <b>T123, T123A and a calf</b> (not in my ID book) that appeared to be about 1 year old.

We finished off the long weekend here by checking out some <b>transient orca</b> off of <b>Orcas Island</b>. We had a group of 6, one of which was <b>T002C </b>but had a hard time identifying the others especially because one was a sprouting male. They were milling around for a while with a lot of playing and then headed north.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>Three sets of Orcas</b> today. We chose a group heading north along the east side of <b>Orcas Island</b>, the <b>T100s</b>, and saw some amazing blows with a dark Orcas Island in the background. Then, over near <b>Sucia Island</b>, they make a kill.

Out with Capt. Jim of Maya's Charters. We met up with the <b>T2Cs</b> and the <b>T123s</b> in <b>Rosario St</b>. on the east side of <b>Orcas Island</b> just north of Barnes Island as they headed north at about <b>3 pm</b>. (These same whales were in Haro Strait on Sunday traveling with T20 and T21, however on Monday T20 and T21 were not present.) They seemed to stop and take a harbor seal from time to time and then as they neared Sucia Island some of the whales began lunging, perhaps going after a porpoise which they quickly made a meal of. I posted pics on my blog of the encounter.

Nancy called from Salt Spring Island with a belated report of <b>Orcas </b>in <b>Trinconeli Channel</b>. There were at least 4 orcas, heading slowly south between Salt Spring and Galiano Islands, by Wallace Island near Fernwood. The pod included 2 males, 1 with a very big fin. 
<br/>*<br/>
I went out with Maya's Westside Charters where, at about <b>5pm</b>, we met up with several <b>transients </b>who were near <b>Discovery Island</b> and were beginning to travel up <b>Haro Strait</b>. <b>T020 and T021</b> were a couple miles to the southeast of the main group. The main group consisted of <b>T002C, T002C1, T002C2, T123, T123A, calf T123B</b>. T020 changed his location and moved over and traveled with the main group. T021 was still far off to the east. At about <b>7:45pm</b> while on the Center for Whale Research (CWR) boat with Ken Balcomb, apx. a mile south of Kelp Reef Marker, we watched as T021 moved across Haro Strait to meet up with the main group as they continued to travel north.

Around <b>noon </b> we observed <b>a gray whale</b> heading north along the south-eastern coast of <b>Camano Island</b>. The gray was making steady progress northward, not stopping to eat; it was not swimming right along shore.

There was much conjecture as to whether there were two calves or one with the mother (<b>Humpback whale</b>). The conversation went back and forth all day. When I got to them late in the afternoon they were all coming out of <b>Bedwell Harbor, Pender Island, BC</b>, and the whale watch boat on scene said that he had seen both calves surface at the same time. From the pictures that I took, I can only find two whales total, though I thought I saw two calves also.

We came out into some pretty rough waters today but it ended up being worth it. We went just south of <b>Sand Heads Light, north of the Fraser River, BC</b>, and found <b>6 transient orca</b> including <b>T124 and T87</b>.

The afternoon trip took Vanessa and I over 52 nm North of Victoria. 2nm East of Porlier Pass (top end of <b>Galiano Island</b>) we encountered the <b>T-100's</b>. The whales were all grouped together and seemed to be staying in one location doing long dives. Based on this behaviour and the presence of gulls circling the area, we presumed that they were actively feeding - having a late lunch. After about 25 minutes of staying in one spot the whales started to swim to the Northwest towards Gabriola Island. Earlier in the day, we had heard from Jim Maya, that they were together with other Transients, however, we could not find the other animals at all. <br/>Jeff Lamarche, Eagle Wing Tours, Victoria B.C.

After sailing up the West Coast last week in the Oregon Offshore Race and seeing Humpbacks, Gray Whales, Brown Pelicans and Tufted Puffins it was a nice change to see some Killer Whales in Georgia Strait. Vanessa and I had a brilliant encounter with the T-100's and the T-101's off of East Point Light. The whales were traveling Southeast towards Patos Island and were swimming through the huge tidal rips off of boiling Reef. All around the whales were lots of Seals, Sea Lions and Harbour Porpoise also feeding in the same area.

I was riding the Kingston/Edmonds ferry from Edmonds at <b>7:30pm</b> when a woman who was sitting on the L side of the boat told me as we were walking off that she thought she'd seen a large <b>grey whale</b> just under the water, nearer the Edmonds side. She said she also thought she saw some porpoise fins. She said she'd clearly seen the tail shape of the large grey mass just under the water (no spouts or nothing surfaced). I didn't see anything myself.

We had a wonderful sighting of what appeared to be <b>6 to 8 Orca whales</b> traveling southeast along the north side of <b>Patos </b>and then <b>Sucia </b>(San Juan Islands). The sighting occurred at approx. <b>4:50 pm</b>. There was one large male of particular note. They seemed to be swimming in 2 to 3 groups along the outer edges of the tidal currents.

At approximately <b>noon</b>, we got the radio call that one of our boats had spotted a single <b>orca</b> in <b>Georgia Strait</b>, near the midpoint of <b>Galiano Island</b>. As we headed in that direction, the report grew to <b>4 whales</b>. When we were still 5 miles away, we were distracted by a huge splash, then fins. We had found our own group of <b>T's</b> northeast of <b>Active Pass</b>, and they were busily hunting an unfortunate young sea lion. We stopped some distance away to watch these top predators take turns at subduing their prey. A few minutes later, a limp brown body was floating at the surface. The 5 T's - <b>T87, T88, T124, T124D &amp; T124E</b> - stayed under for several minutes at a time, followed by excited surfacings. Soon the first seagull arrived for scraps, followed by his friends. During the encounter, it was noted that T87 has some fresh wounds at the tip of his dorsal fin, on both sides, which appear to be rake marks. Our 5 T's remained in the same area, milling and eating, and vocalizing! Meanwhile, the other group of T's were now up to 9 individuals - T14, T100's (including T100E, but not T100D), T101's, and T102 - and had moved to within a mile of our location. We could see that group porpoising towards us. When the two groups met, it was a casual meeting compared to the precision lineup of resident orcas. We did observe 3 head-head meetings in which one whale would always back away, and then angle head-up before slipping below the surface. T14 was not present during the meet &amp; greet. We last saw the whales headed in a southwesterly direction towards Mayne Island, a long line of blows and fins.

Orca Network received a call from Tom Paulu of the Longview Daily News, relaying a report he'd had from a man who saw <b>2 orcas</b> in the <b>Columbia River</b> near Longview at 2 PM. Howard talked to the man, Scott White, who saw the orcas from hwy 4/Ocean Beach Hwy while sitting on the guard rail waiting for construction on the road. The whales were 30' away, and he saw one adult and one smaller orca, approx. 8 - 10 miles downstream from Longview, WA, near Stella and Germany Creek. Brent Norberg of NOAA Fisheries wrote "According to the Coast Pilot Stella is at river mile 48.9" - wow! that's nearly 50 miles upriver!!

Jim Maya and Jeanne Hyde called at <b>2:50 pm</b> - they had <b>10 - 15 Transients</b> 4 miles SE of <b>Active Pass</b> heading toward East Pt. in Georgia Strait, heading toward a bunch of Steller sea lions. They called again at <b>4:15 pm</b> to report they were with Transient orcas<b> T100B &amp; C, T101, T101A&amp;B and T102</b>, 3 miles off Patos Light heading toward Patos Island.

Today I was out with Capt. Jim of Maya's Westside Charters and having learned of transients near Active Pass we went to locate them. When we found them at about <b>2:30 pm</b> they were east of <b>Active Pass</b>, a few miles from shore, heading east toward East Point. There were two groups - the <b>T100s and the T101s</b> and T102 was with the T101s. However there was one whale who was missing from the T100 group - a 4 year old who has been missing since last year. After observing this group for a while, who were in a slow but steady travel mode it was clear that T100D, a 4 year old was NOT present. Present in that group were T100, T100B, T100C and the baby T100E. Traveling in a parallel fashion yet a more than a 1/2 mile from this group were the T101s, consisting of T101, T101A and T101B, and with them was T102. No other whales were observed in the area, in flat calm water, during the time we were there. I will be posting pics on my blog in a while (and see photo of the day, above).

Today around <b>130 pm</b> we were in our boat out of the shores of <b>edmonds</b>. We were watching the regatta race and there in the middle of it was a single <b>grey whale</b>. When we first saw it he was playing and he was raising his head out of the water. After a while he slowly headed north and all you could really see was just his spout hole. We have not seen him before due to not making it up that way alot yet. But cant wait to spend a summer watching these beautiful creatures.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>7 transients</b> spent about 7 hours traveling about 7 miles! <b>T87, T88, T90, T90B, T124, T124D and T124E</b> acted more like a group of Southern Residents than the typical unpredictable zigzagging transient behavior that is common with Ts. Of course they were in a resting mode for a large portion of the time. They were first reported at <b>Pile Pt</b>. in a resting mode at about <b>8:30 in the morning.</b> By noon they had made it to Lime Kiln park a distance of just a few miles. They split into two groups T87 with T124, T124D and T124E and the other three T88, T90 and T90B in the farther offshore group still going north. The last I heard they were at <b>Open Bay</b>, a few miles north of Lime Kiln at <b>3:30</b>.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries relayed a report from Ron Bates of Victoria's MMRG of a small group of <b>orcas </b>off <b>Pile point</b> in the <b>morning</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Kathy Fritts of Freeland called to relay a report of <b>orcas </b>milling in <b>Saratoga Passage</b> N. of Greenbank, at <b>12:05 pm</b>, heading north closer to the Whidbey side. Nancy Zaretzke had observed one or two orcas off Hidden Beach a short time before that, heading north.

Barb Nichols called to report a couple of <b>Orcas </b>in <b>Saratoga Passage</b> near Baby Island at the entrance to Holmes Harbor, at <b>7:30 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We watched <b>2 orcas</b> about ¼ mile east of <b>Baby Island, Saratoga Passage</b>in shallow water swimming a tight circle. They must have been hunting because they continued the tight circle for several minutes, got the binoculars and saw one roll on his(?) side and saw a fairly large pool of blood in the water but did not see any seal or fish pieces floating. They then headed north. One appeared to have a notch out of his aft dorsal fin about half way up. This all took place about <b>7:15am</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
On a search for more orcas I went back through the pass and headed to the Belle Chain in Georgia Strait. At <b>1430</b>, after seeing the hundreds of sea lions, those southerly fins that I probably saw earlier were heading north. Were these more residents? It was looking possible with the close group of 6 or 7 and others seen off in the distance. As time passed the 1 or 2 off in the distance joined the small group for some socializing. At <b>1330 </b>some of these <b>Transients </b>went along the shoreline north of <b>Active Pass</b> while the others moved parallel further off shore.

Finally, a sighting of resident killer whales for those of us in the northern portion of their range. Some of <b>L pod</b> were located at approximately <b>noon </b>today, just entering <b>Active Pass</b> from the east side, at Georgina Point. Although the usual direction of travel for them is west to east, this was a little deja vu of the return of L pod last spring. The group stayed close to the Mayne Island shoreline, and entered Miner's Bay. They then did an abrupt change of path, putting them in the centre of the pass, in the tide rips (tide was on a flood at the time), and in the pathway of an oncoming ferry. The ferry had slowed for the whales, and once it passed, there was no sight of them, until we looked behind us. They had circled back into Miner's Bay to take another try at the pass. Numerous spyhops ensued, always by the same whale with some distinctive lines along the mouth. For the remainder of Active Pass, the group stayed very close to the Mayne Island shore. Their blows were remarkable against the dark background, however, ID's were difficult with shaded saddle patches. As the whales approached the end of the pass they became more active with some upside down swimming, tail slaps, pec slaps, half breaches (see photo), kelping and finally porpoising their way into <b>Swanson Channel</b>. Where they had been quite close together through Active Pass, they split off into several small groups in Swanson. Some groups porpoised quickly into the distance, some traveled leisurely against the current, and others kept up the breaching contest! The whales we could definitely ID were the <b>L12's</b>, including <b>L25, the L5's and L22's</b>. There may have been more.
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
Awesome day today with <b>L pod</b> just south of <b>active pass</b>. Lots of breaching and spyhops and we even got to see Lolita's mom <b>L25</b>. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
At approximately <b>1200 </b>I saw some fins on the west side of <b>Active Pass</b>. It looked as if some fins were also south of the pass but more about that later. At approximately 1230 I entered the pass where some whale watch companies were with the orcas in Miner's Bay. There were about <b>20 L pod orcas</b> moving in tight groups through along the southerly shore when a ferry approached. The orcas grouped up and were back in Miner's Bay. As they moved again to exit the pass numerous eagles were soaring above. After some head views, pec slaps, and porpoising they left the pass at <b>1310</b>. Once in Swanson Channel they picked up speed and spread out.

I was fortunate enough today to be out at <b>Lime Kiln</b> (W. San Juan Island) to see <b>L-pod's</b> homecoming. I saw Ocean Sun, Flash (who looks more &amp; more like his Daddy ..lol) as well as Calypso and her calf L113. It was approx <b>5:30 or 6 pm</b> when we could see them coming from the north -- VERY spread out &amp; only a few came close to shore. Looked like they were headed towards Victoria.

We began hearing <b>Southern Resident orca calls</b> on the Orca Sound hydrophone (NW San Juan Island) at <b>4:45 pm</b>. At about <b>6:25 pm </b>we began to hear calls on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> as<b> L pod</b> continued south - heard calls until at least <b>7:30 pm</b>. 
<br/>
The Center for Whale Research was with members of <b>L pod</b> - the <b>L9, L12, and L54</b> sub-pods, off Stuart Island at <b>3:42 pm</b>, following them south. At <b>4:40 pm</b> they were off <b>Henry Island</b>, at <b>5:30 off NW San Juan Island</b>. We were able to see some of the orcas on the Center's Orca Cam, while listening to them on the Beam Reach/Whale Museum OrcaSound hydrophones! Thanks to all of the above for providing these amazing technologies for those of us not lucky enough to see or hear the whales first-hand!

<b>11:00 am</b> - Near Norwegian Point Park, (<b>Hansville</b>, Kitsap County). Spotted large white water disturbance in the waters across the sound, off <b>Double Bluff</b>, Whidbey Island. It turned out to be at least 4-5 very, very active <b>orcas</b>! Perhaps socializing? It sure looked like play to me. They stayed in one area for some time and close to the surface diving and leaping from the water sometimes a couple in unison. With binoculars it appears that one had to be a male from the size and one appeared to be a juvenile. They then moved quickly across the shipping lanes, (no ships in sight) some porpoising, some underwater, still quite far from the western shore and headed north. What a joy to see such a show of life!

A number of <b>orcas </b>were just East of Wing Point, on <b>Bainbridge Island</b>, as seen from the <b>0620 </b>ferry as it left Eagle Harbor. There were only two on the surface at any one time, but it appeared that there were at least <b>3-4</b> total. They were about 150 yards offshore. At least one had a fairly prominent dorsal. Not sure if they were feeding or not, but they were moving very slowly to the North at first, and then were headed to the West, toward Bainbridge.

<br/>Rob Casey, Seattle
<br/>*<br/>
I was kayaking near the rocks at tongue point, 150ft from shore near salt creek state park outside Port Angeles at about <b>5PM</b>. Saw dark gray/light black whale circulating and surfacing repeatedly in the same area. Sort of looked like an extremely robust and large dolphin. Dorsal fin was curved back like a scythe. Head had a thick short nose, dolphin like but chunkier. Animal was at least 10ft long, may have been 15ft. I went home and <b>pilot whale</b> seemed to be the correct ID. May have been two because there seemed to be some size differences but that may just be a false impression since I didn't see two separate animals. Animal kept getting closer and closer to me, so I decided to move off, but we continued to see him break the surface just past the waves. Never seen this type of whale at salt creek but may have seen one on the outside of dungeness spit a couple of years ago.

It was heading north up San Juan Channel, and we were with it on the boat from <b>10:05-10:50</b> during our morning trip. I heard it went up Spieden Channel and through Johns Pass (!) before we met up with the animal again in the afternoon. Between <b>3:00 and 3:30 PM</b> it was heading northeast up <b>Boundary Pass </b>near Skipjack Island.

We headed east towards the belle chain islands to check out the Steller sea lion haul out and on our way we got a big surprise!! At the east point of <b>Mayne Island</b> (Swanson Channel) we saw a dorsal fin in the distance and then the huge fin of <b>T20 </b>surfaced along with four others! When we first arrived there was a lot of playing and looked like even a little mating! Then they continued to head west along the shore of Galiano island.

We were already on our homeward journey this afternoon, 5 T's had been spotted in Georgia Strait near the southeast corner of <b>Mayne Island</b>. When we arrived on scene, we observed 5 individuals that appeared to be resting as they moved slowly northwest close in to the Mayne Island shoreline. The whales were ID'ed as <b>T20, T21, T2C, T2C1 and T2C2</b>. The whales drifted a bit to the east as they moved by <b>Active Pass</b>, then moved back closer to the shoreline as they continued towards Galiano Island. We left the group headed northwest, at approximately <b>1530 </b>hrs, just north of <b>Active Pass.</b> They appeared to be still in resting behaviour.

I had <b>Transient orcas T020 and T021 with the T002C's</b> east bound west of <b>Sooke </b>at <b>1030 </b>. At the same time <b>CA058 and T124C</b> were spotted off <b>Victoria </b>heading west. They met up with T020's group in the afternoon near <b>Race Rocks</b> and all continued east for Trial Island. At approximately 1830 CA058 and T124C broke off while the others continued north east for Haro Strait.

As we were heading West on the afternoon tour, Vanessa and I picked up <b>T-20, T-21 and the T-2's</b> approximately 1 nm Southwest of Church Rk. (2.5 nm West of <b>Race Rocks</b>) at <b>1345 </b>hrs. The five Transients were grouped together and traveling East towards Race Rocks Lighthouse. During our stay with them we saw one seal kill near Race Passage. At which point, the animals went off -- Lots of spyhops, breaches and tail flips -- Brilliant !! Later in the tour, the group of five Transients met up with two others, T-124C and CA058 near Albert Hd. Once all together, the seven Killer Whales proceeded Northeast towards Victoria. Our encounter finished at <b>1615 </b>hrs., 2.5 nm East of <b>Albert Hd</b>.

<b>2 Transients</b> were found in <b>Haro Strait</b> heading southerly along <b>Mandarte Island</b>. It was 2 females, one of which is a fairly regular visitor-<b>T124C</b>. The other was a bit of a surprise in that it was <b>CA58</b>, or a California Transient.

We saw this mother/calf <b>pair of gray whales</b> on Mother's Day at Patrick's Point in <b>Humboldt County, California</b>. The calf had a very light colored tail, so maybe you can recognize it as it moves up the coast. The calf also had some marks on the face that made us think of orca teeth marks? (could also possibly be from rubbing on Mom's barnacles? sb). We also saw another pair of grays that were closer in size, but the smaller of the two was a very pale color.

Our Stranding Network received several calls about <b>a Gray whale</b> in <b>Oak Harbor</b> "beaching itself", but it was the Gray whale that has been regularly feeding in the area just feeding in shallow water.
One call came in at <b>7:30 pm</b> from Neal Ketchum of the Oak Harbor Marina. The dispatcher had called him to report a call of a gray whale beaching itself near buoy #8. At 7:10 pm we received a call from a man who had been in the sail boat regatta today. He reported a beached gray whale near Buoy #8 which may be near the east end of the harbor. 
<br/>*<br/>
We just returned from a day sail in Saratoga Passage. As we were motoring out of <b>Oak Harbor Marina</b>, we saw <b>a lone gray whale</b> feeding in the shallows on the East side of the channel, between the shore and the red channel markers. The tide was still low, and it was moving very slowly. We turned off the engine and drifted on the other side of the channel to watch for a bit. There were a number of boats coming in from the Round Whidbey race, and some coming out from the marina to watch, and all were very respectful and gave the whale distance - it helped too, that the whale was inside the channel markers. 
We originally saw the whale about <b>11am</b> though it looked as though it had been there for awhile. We watched for about 30 minutes, and when we continued out the channel, the whale continued traveling in toward the R"8" marker. We could still see it near the innermost marker after a good 60 minutes or so after we left the channel. When we came back in after sailing at about <b>4pm</b>, we saw a couple of blows of presumably the same whale at about the number 4 marker. It seemed to be traveling out of the channel.

I was on the Washington State Ferry going from <b>Keystone to Port Townsend</b>. Suddenly the back of a medium sized whale appeared in their midst, scattering the birds and the whale exhaled with a low diffuse spout. Given the behavior, size, shape and color I am confident that the whale was a <b>minke</b>.

We deployed several satellite tags on <b>fin whales</b> which indicated the whales were spending their time in deep water between the Astoria Canyon and Grays Canyon- roughly <b>40 miles from shore</b>. We headed southwest from Grays Harbor and encountered more fin whales in this area, and also several <b>humpbacks </b>in the southernmost reaches of our survey. We deployed an additional satellite tag and collected several biopsy samples which will be used for genetic analyses of stock structure. In total we collected 20 or more photo-ID's for comparison to our fin whale catalog, and to our great surprise encountered a fin whale we know from several years of research in Southern California, which was exciting as it is our first documented cross-regional match. All in all, a very productive two days toward a better understanding of this population.

I was kayaking with a group of friends from Salsbury Pt. to <b>Kingston </b>, and as we approached Apple Cove Pt. just north of Kingston at about <b>12:30pm</b> we saw a whale blow just in front of us and only about 10-15 foot from shore. As we paddled past the point we got several good views of him, enough to determine that it was a feeding <b>gray whale</b>. A large wake from a container vessel came thru just then and the whale moved east into deeper water and looked like it was moving north toward Pt. No Point.

Riding the Clinton to <b>Mukilteo </b>ferry to work at around <b>7:15</b>, a few friends and I were lucky enough to see a <b>gray whale</b>. I spotted it as it suddenly came up out of the water (closer to the Mukilteo side) and dove revealing its fluke. We didn't see it for a few minutes after that, but it came up again blowing and diving repeatedly at a leisurely pace. Seemed to be heading southward and was alone. What a way to start a day!

I was on the 3:50 ferry from Bainbridge and half way to Seattle there was a <b>porpoise </b>jumping next to the ferry boat about 4 times completely out of the water. He was alone and having fun. I have <b>never seen this particular type of porpoise</b> in Puget Sound. It was mottled gray and black, quite narrow, 3 feet long.

<b>Mariners Cove</b> Sighting. N.E. Whidbey around <b>6:45PM</b>, was on patio when I noticed some movement in the water with lots of birds nearby. Wasn't sure it was a <b>gray</b>, but, few minutes later came a spout. It was a couple hours after low tide and gray seemed to be somewhat lackadaisical. Ever slowly meandering N.E.; submerging itself but appeared not to be feeding much or at all. Searching or checking things out to come back to when higher tide? Along the way, gray did have enough energy to launch its entire head out of the water. At Mariners Cove marina entrance, gray turned sharp right and headed out to deeper water. Last spout/fluke seen meandering, east; towards Brown Point, at north end of Camano Island, near Stanwood.

My husband, Kevin, and I are sitting here puzzling over a strange sighting he had directly south of the <b>Lopez Ferry terminal</b>. He watched it from <b>8:15am-9:15am</b>. It was about <b>8 feet long, dark gray</b>, with a thick muscular tail stock, swept back dorsal fin and distinct, short beak. For most of the time he was watching it, it was playing with or unsuccessfully trying to eat a salmon. We looked at several guides and the closest that he could come up with was a <b>bottlenosed dolphin, which seems nearly impossible</b>. The catch seems to be the distinct beak.

We received a call around <b>noon </b>from Sharon Soderberg of the <b>Point No Point resort near Sooke, B.C.</b>, reporting <b>a dead orca calf</b> washed up on their beach. She sent a photo to us, which shows a newborn calf, fetal folds still visible. Sharon said it was approximately 8.5' long, and the umbilical cord was still attached.
<br/>The Dept. of Fisheries Marine Mammal Stranding Network responded, and a necropsy was performed under the direction of Canada's DFO. 
We have had a number of Transient orcas in the area, but J pod had also been in the region just days before the stranding, so it isn't yet known who the calf belonged to. We will forward on any further information on this as it becomes available.

We watched a 30-35' <b>gray whale</b> feeding on the east side of Tala Point (head of <b>Hood Canal</b>, west side) starting about <b>6:00 PM</b>. It was feeding in the shallows, in water as shallow as 8 feet, 75' from shore. It fed back and forth along the shoreline for about 1/3 mile. We watched it for about 1.5 hours. It left swimming towards Admiralty Inlet once the wind started to drop. 
<br/>We have lived here 20 years. Only the 4th sighting in this area. Usually they are cruising by, first evidence of feeding behavior we have seen on the beach in front of our home. Can't wait to go down at low tide to see the changes the whale caused.

I saw <b>ORCA </b>traveling North in <b>Sansum Narrows</b> between <b>6:15 - 6:30 PM</b>. It was stormy-rough with the North wind blowing white caps and big waves from the wild wind storm that hit the BC Coast Sunday night and blew all day Monday. Of course, the whales could dive below the rough water. It looked like there were about 5-6. One huge male with a fat dorsal fin at the base and looking like it was chopped off at the top (I was in my boat to the left of the whales). Several females? Maybe a baby? I snapped a few digital with my dinky LUMIX, just for ID, and in one photo I see 4 whales up at once. I imagine these are Transients. Do you have any idea who they are?

Ed Bowlby of the Olympic Coast Natl. Marine Sanctuary called to report <b>two orcas</b> (not adult males) inside the breakwater off <b>Pt. Angeles</b>, at the western end, 200 meters from the commercial pier, heading north at <b>10:10 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Had a single large adult <b>grey </b>feeding all over Elger Bay (<b>SW Camano Island</b>) this morning in both deep and shallow areas. I noticed it about <b>8:00 AM</b>, and it moved on about 9:00. Looked to be 30-40 feet in length.

I heard from Ivan of the Western Prince that Island Commuter said they saw <b>J Pod</b> in <b>Rosario Strait</b>, at Tide Pt. (Cypress Island) heading south at about <b>5:30 pm</b>.

We watched <b>four to five transient orcas</b> traveling slowly and surfacing regularly every few minutes in Chancellor Channel of <b>D'Arcy Point</b> in BC (Haro Strait) from <b>11-11:30am.</b> One male, the others females or juvenile males.

Western Prince joined up with <b>J Pod</b> at approximately <b>1:20 p.m</b>. They were headed south in Rosario Strait. We were able to parallel <b>J-14</b>, and <b>J-30</b> and the rest of the sub pod for about an hour! It was absolutely spectacular to be back on the water with the Southern Residents today! They were mostly traveling, but there was an occasional stop for foraging and a few tail slaps. I did see a few breaches in the distance, likely from other J Pod whales. We left them about <b>2:45 p.m</b>. as they were headed around the south tip of Lopez Island.

Deception Pass Tour saw <b>J Pod</b> about 1 mile off <b>Deception Island</b> heading west at <b>2:23pm</b>. They are spread out all the way across Rosario Strait.

We were with <b>J pod</b> off of <b>Iceberg Point</b>, moving west very slowly fighting the flood (incoming) tide. I felt great to be watching a group of whales I have been with for 23 year. I could almost read their thoughts and motives for what they were doing. There was a three to four foot chop. The whales would break through the crest of a wave and plow through the next.

<b>Five Transient Killer Whales</b> were spotted off of <b>Sooke Harbour</b> this morning! By the time Brett and I got out on our 2:30 trip, the five Transients were well into <b>Haro Strait</b> headed for San Juan Island. Our encounter with Captain Hook (T-40) and four other females started at <b>4:15</b> pm, just over half a mile to the Northeast of <b>Kelp Reef</b>. The five Transients were grouped together doing long dives as they swam to the North. For approximately 20 minutes, we paralleled these animals from quite a distance when all of a sudden, T-40 and company did a 180 degree turn and increased their speed! Within minutes, we noticed a large Steller Sea Lion was thrashing around in between the five whales. For the next hour we watched the five Transients batter and ram the Steller Sea Lion into oblivion. During the course of our stay, we saw many high speed lunges, breaches, dolphin leaps and tail lobs. Captain Hook seemed to stay on the outskirts while the four females did most of the work on the Sea Lion. (Very similar to how a pride of Lions work !!) Our encounter with the whales ended just after <b>5:20 pm</b> at which point the Steller Sea Lion was still alive but badly beaten up.

I went out with Maya's Westside Charters toward the south end of San Juan Island to hopefully meet J Pod, who was traveling down Rosario Strait. On our way we got word that <b>5 transients</b> were closer to our location, so we changed course and headed for them. T40 and who appeared to be 3 females and an juvenile, (just confirmed by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research as <b>T071, T071A, T071B and T071C</b>) were beginning to head north up Haro Strait, zigzagging their way back and forth across the strait as they continued north. Their dives were approximately 5+ minutes in length. Then they changed direction back to the south and with the next surfacing we could tell they had found some prey, a Steller sea lion- blog post from that encounter: 'Capt Hook is in Town!'

<br/>*<br/>
We heard a report this morning that <b>5 Orcas</b> had been seen near <b>Sooke </b>heading East at around <b>8.30am.</b> Despite a thorough search of the area in cooperation with another boat, we were unable to find the Orcas. However, as we headed out in the afternoon we reminded all the boats heading out to be on the lookout for these Transients and sure enough they were spotted near <b>Discovery Island</b>, just off Seabird Point! As we arrived on scene we immediately identified Cpt. Hook (<b>T40</b>), along with four females. We followed the Orcas as they crisscrossed up Haro Strait, obviously in hunting mode. In fact near the end of our trip we did see them make a kill! The Orcas were a little South East of Kelp Reef when we left them.

As we head south I find out that there are <b>Transient Orcas</b> over near <b>Victoria </b>headed our way. Much closer than the Js so we head over there. We find <b>T40</b>, "Capt. Hook" and family heading lazily north, zigzagging back and forth, looking for prey. As they get close to <b>Kelp Reef</b>, the water explodes and we know that they are after a sea lion. This continues for over an hour and a half. Right after we left, they killed it and ate it.

I saw whale spouts in the water off of <b>Pt. No Point WA</b>--between the Point and Hansville this afternoon. I saw at least 3 or 4 spouts and the back of one whale (probably a <b>gray</b>) between <b>4:40 and 6 P.M.</b> We have seen almost daily evidence of whales in this same area off and on since earlier this week.

April 27 - May 1 - Thought I'd better follow up on the sightings around <b>Point No Point and Hansville WA.</b> Last Tuesday, April 27th, then yesterday, April 30th and today, May 1st <b>a lone gray whale</b> has been feeding up and down Skunk Bay about 2 miles north of the Hansville store (N. Kitsap Peninsula). It's been showing up around <b>8:30 </b>and working the sandy part of the shore beyond the rocks while the tide is going out. I'd say at times it's no more than 30 or 40 feet offshore. The whale looks to be about 30 feet in length. It seems to be very slowly feeding his way north to the end of skunk bay, then turns and heads back south along the shoreline. It'll spout once or twice then turn on its side and do circles exposing its fins and tail(?). This all occurs over about 4 to 5 hours. I'll attach some shots I took from our place about midway low bank in Skunk Bay.
