Sailed South onto glassy waters <b>south of Lopez Island</b> and changed course for Hein Bank with news of transient orcas. We sailed back towards Lopez with the <b>T46Bs</b> alongside as the sun was setting. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. - A group of Orcas in Port Angeles</b>, they seemed like they were fishing. I tried to get picture of them, but they weren't surfacing...was able to see dorsal fins of about 5 or 6. It was around 2:00pm they came in and circled around the harbor starting by the Coast Guard station and down to the mill where they lingered for sometime and then back out. I am not to familiar with the area I was on the spit though. My first time actually seeing them in the wild. I was so excited. I guess they were traveling north, Iost site of them on the other side of the harbor behind an anchored ship. They seemed to be diving deeply, as they were heading out. -Kathleen Barker

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We received this message which sounds like could be <b>a humpback: 9:44 a.m</b>. - Just briefly spotted a whale hump about 200 yards off of the north end of Johnson point headed <b>SE towards Nisqually</b>. No fin noted. Black. -Tina Davis

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:13 a.m. -</b> Just drove across the <b>Tacoma Narrows Bridge </b>and saw blows beneath can someone please confirm if there is a whale there? -Beverly Varela
<br/>(<i>above May 31 humpback reports are unconfirmed, but most probable- ALB</i>)

Newbie alert!  <b>Little un' with T100B, fresh with fetal folds, at most 7 days old</b>. We saw T100B on May 22nd with no baby, and today <b>in the Strait of Georgia</b> she was with her new little one along<b> with the rest of the T100s and the T123s</b>. -Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

We saw breaching orcas <b>from the Nanaimo ferry</b>, close to shore as we pulled away <b>from Vancouver Island</b>, this morning at <b>11 AM</b>. No ID's but at least one big male, very active breaches as the pod (<b>about 4-5</b> I think) travelled along the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>. A lovely surprise encounter. -Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Calm seas were back for our Memorial Day trip, yay! We headed south, then west, towards <b>Discovery Island (almost to Victoria, BC)</b> based on reports of<b> a humpback whale and Transient/Biggs killer whales!</b> Unfortunately the killer whales turned west and headed out past Sooke, BC, but the humpback turned our way and we had some excellent views as the whale (no ID yet) <b>slowly headed towards San Juan Island</b>. We watched several tail flukes before heading back east, enjoyed all the Steller sea lions at Whale rocks, and found some very pregnant harbor seals near Castle Rock (seal pup season is fast approaching). An awesome Memorial Day trip! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 a.m. - a gray whale</b> spouted, surfaced, rolled a bit, and then dove with a huge fluke display just 150-200 yards offshore at <b>Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island</b>. It was headed south and seemed to be "en route" somewhere beyond us. Magnificent! Traveling and we assume eating as there is good supply off our shoreline!  -Dianne Bratz

Flying upside down orca pretty much made my day. Out with the <b>T75Bs &amp; T77s zig-zagging Hein Bank</b> - Juan de Fuca Strait, seas very rolly. I also got to "meet" T77's newest kiddo - T77E, and T077 surfing along a swell. Sunday off Port Angeles. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T077 tail lobbing with her oldest offspring, 16 yr old T077B</b>. Sunday morning off Port Angeles. -James Gresham

Spotted a whale (smaller and it had a small dorsal) traveling north west through Port of Washington Narrows passage into <b>Dyes Inlet at 0630 am</b>. -Will Grindstaff

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">May 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>2:30 p.m. - </b>Good afternoon, we were blessed on the water today with <b>a small pod of Transients</b> swim past us. My first time seeing them so close, they just swam up to us. Thought I would share with you. This was at <b>Freshwater/Crescent Bay near Port Angeles</b>. Lots of whale boats coming out of Victoria/Canada trying to catch up to them. Was a Blessing to us today to see these Majestic animals. They were heading out west. (<i>Photos include <b>T137s, T125A and 128</b> - ALB</i>.) -Sandy Thompson Watne

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had the <b>7 orcas with the T77s and T75Bs way up in Canada heading north today up by Sidney Island</b>. -Bart Rulon, Island Adventures

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>One Male Orca in the Siuslaw River, Florence OR. Saturday, the 28th, about 1730 hrs</b>, sighted male Orca breaching in river. Small fishing boat 'escorted' it at a distance until it went back over the bar and back into Pacific. Was sighted by someone else (before my video and sighting), about 30 minutes earlier about a mile or less up river, just south of the Siuslaw River Coast Guard Station. -Debbie Heldt Cordone

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:30 p.m. - Saw a whale swimming up the Washington Narrows and under the Manette bridge from the Boathouse restraunt</b>. This one had a small or irregular fin, couldn't tell which. What caught my eye was the lack of the large dorsal fin common to the Orcas which make periodic visits to the area. Also much larger animal What caught our attention was the large blow that towared 15 feet or more when he surfaced. -John Lorimer

<b>Humpbacks in Port Orchard Bay this morning</b>. The first few seconds of this video the humpback is between the boat and light post. At 15-17 seconds you can hear/kinda see both the humpbacks at once. I'm bummed I didn't get video from the other side of the marina, it swam right next to the fuel dock but I was way too excited to think about video then. -Brittany Gordon
<br/><b>11:30 a.m. - The 2 humpbacks are exiting port orchard bay</b> right now at a fast pace heading NE. 
<br/><b>11:19 a.m. - There are 2 humpbacks.</b>  I got a video of it swimming right past the dock so close to me. I'm still shaking. They are headed northeast now in ferry lane.

It appeared to be moving south or southwest. -Jason Lee Bell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0800 -  Gray whale South side of Southworth dock - it well could have been the humpback</b>. It just surfaced 3 times while I was waiting at the dock, all in the area between the dock and the northern tip of Colvos Passage.  A couple of people said it was a gray, but I didn't think it had the tail of a gray when I saw it, the back looked more like a humpback to me but I'm no expert, so I took their word for it. One of the ferry dock workers, Nicole I think, said it was hanging around the south end of the dock, seemed to be more when the tide was turning. She said usually they hang out between the north end of Southworth Dock and Blake Island. -Kristie Paylor

<b>4:00 p.m. - </b>Seemed every time I looked out across the water today I spotted this <b>Humpback Whale in Possession Sound</b> (North Puget Sound - South of Useless Bay). Earlier I watched as it surfaced for a few blows then it arched into a deep dive showing off it's huge flukes as it dove. It must have been feeding. Later this afternoon, when I again spotted the Humpback, it was at the surface for some R&amp;R time seemingly just enjoying a few sun breaks! Filmed from North Edmonds shoreline. Whale was ~5 miles out.

Trip report - a nice surprise when Sunday turned out to be such a beautiful day. We left the dock with no reports of whales in the area ...until somebody spotted two transient orcas known as the Twins <b>T093 (born in 1963) and T097 (born in 1980)by Partridge Bank</b> , west of Whidbey Island. These 2 whales have been travel companions for many years, and in amazing calm conditions we watched these two, leisurely milling back and forth. When we finally headed north towards home, we found <b>3 Minke whales near Smith Island</b>, tons of seabirds - including Tufted Puffins! On towards Lopez Island we had great views of harbor seals, bald eagles, and a California sea lion in Guemes Channel. What an exciting day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Report: These photos were at quite a distance (not detailed shots, even with a 600mm), but the orcas were so active, I wanted to share. It's a rare treat to get a pod that is in play mode, rather than travel mode, and <b>from 5:15-7pm</b>, these guys just toured around the the waters <b>mid-channel between Steilacoom, McNeil and Fox</b>. We spotted them from the Anderson Island Ferry Dock around 5:15pm in front of the Chambers Bay/Steilacoom waterfront, and watched breach after breach, tail lobbing, and lots of splashing. The ferry was coming in, so we jumped on the 5:40 ferry to Steilacoom and they continued to be pretty active until the ferry got closer. At that point, they went dark and swam further out into the water toward McNeil. At the dock in Steilacoom, we saw them again in front of the prison and the cliffs north of the prison dock. Amazingly, they stayed put in the area for another 20 minutes while the ferry loaded, and as we headed back toward them at 6:30, they meandered around the waters between McNeil and Fox. They became very active again, with lots of breaches. There was one small dorsal that mostly stayed close to an adult female - a baby or young juvenile. In one photo in the album, it appears that <b>there might have been 6, but there were 5 for sure</b>
<br/><b>6:46 p.m. - Between McNeil and Fox island</b>, trending west southwest
<br/><b>6:18 p.m. -They are just north of the McNeil ferry dock</b>, pretty stationary and milling.

<b>7:40 pm -</b> we made it to <b>Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island, just in time to spot the <b>Puget Sound transients heading north</b> with purpose, no milling, no foraging, passing Lagoon Point and continuing onward towards the glow of the setting sun. What a way to end another glorious day in the Pacific Northwest with nature at its best. -Sandra Pollard

Day report <b>T137s, T125A &amp; T128</b>. Awesome day on Puget Sound today! Spotted <b>a pod of Orcas in Elliott Bay </b>(between Seattle and Bainbridge Island) heading north. Paralleled the pod as I made my way back to Edmonds Marina (Homeport). A number of times the pod dove deep and for a long time only to come up and close in on me. I always stopped the engines and raised the props from the water! I soon found out why the Orcas were zig zagging and double backing / "stalking" me! <b>A sea lion was apparently using my boat as refuge / hiding place</b>. At one time I had the sea lion trying to get on my transom while up to six Orcas were surrounding my boat! These photos represent a sample of the encounters - I also have some video I'll post (YouTube) of the Orcas pursuing the sea lion.n
<br/><b>3:04 p.m. -</b> still shaking! S<b>ea lion hiding under my boat. Orcas all up to the sides and under.</b> I haven't seen the sea lion since and the orcas have continued north.  WOW -Stu Davidso

Here are a few photos from today's <b>transient superpod in Rosario Strait</b>.  The killer whales present included, at least, the <b>T11s, T65As, T65Bs, T93, and T97</b>!  T11 and T11A were very active! They both tail slapped over and over again. T11A got the acrobatics started with a breach, followed by a double breach with his mom, T11, and then she followed it up with a couple solo breaches of her own. After a break of a few minutes T11A breached another 4 times in a row, and T11 cartwheeled at the same time!! 4 of the photos attached are of big T11A breaching, and one is of his mom, T11, breaching. -Bart Rulon

After spending most of the day cruising the far reaches of Puget Sound, taking in this beautiful day - And, all the while keeping an eye out for reported Orcas - It wasn't until we returned home that I spotted an Orca Pod many miles west in Admiralty Inlet. Spotted this Pod of Transient Orcas this evening line of sight well east of Point No Point and South Of Useless Bay (South Whidbey Island). The behavior of the Orcas seems very likely they had made a kill and became very active! Long distance video from north Edmonds shoreline to subjects 4-5 miles out. -Stu Davidson

Bigg's killer whale encounter! It's such a humbling experience sharing this ecosystem with some of the most sentient beings on this Earth. We spent the day with nearly twenty mammal-hunting Bigg's killer whales and watched as they made predation event after predation event, and entered into a period of very social bliss towards the end of the day. Watching that many individuals, listing to the phonemail vocalizations through our hydrophone, and witnessing that kind of tactile behavior from this eco-type of killer whale is incredibly rare!! They're usually very quiet, inconspicuous, and stealthy to exploit their intelligent marine-mammal prey ...Pictured here are the <b>T036A's, T065A's, T065B's (sisters who were also seen here exactly a year ago to the date), T093, T097, T99's, and the T123's</b>. -Heather MacIntyre

For the past several weeks, <b>Bigg's Killer Whales or Transients have been hanging out in the Southern Hood Canal </b>area. Well, we were finally able to get a peek at them. Unfortunately, we were <b>at Triton Cove, and they were on the opposite side</b> heading North between Frenchmans Cove and Hood Point.

<b>10:00 a.m. -Whale sighting off the coast of Oregon. 4-5 orcas (possible male as one bigger than the others). North end of Heceta Bank</b>  44*11.779'N   124*48.721'W.  Birds and seals were feeding on a bait ball. Then the Orca's showed up and were eating the bait. Some of the seals left immediately. When the bait was gone the whale turned their attention to the seals. Most of the seals were able to get away except of a group of 25. These the Orca's seemed to be teaching the baby's (2) how to herd the seals into a tight ball. Then one of the adults would come out of the water and land on them. Then the seals would run and it would start all over. We didn't see the whale eat or bite any seals. There was no blood in the water. We were about 1/2 miles away halibut fishing. -Larry Smith

Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 44 Summary: The morning started before 9am with Jane Cogan calling to relay an earlier report of <b>20+ whales coming in off the Victoria waterfront</b> and that she was now hearing them on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone. Mark Malleson got out on the water and found the whales in Mike 1 and then reported to us that the <b>K12's and K13's were present along with J pod and L87</b>...

<b>Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca as many J's and a few K's foraged and socialized between Salmon Bank and Hein Bank.</b> So great to see them having some down time with each other! Southern Resident Killer Whale, <b>J19 Shachi</b>, born in 1979, decided she was going to give us a really close "swim by" off our stern! Sometimes, these animals are just as curious about us, as we are of them. Moments like this are so short lived. -Renee Beitzell

<b>9am-10am - Grey Whale encounter today off east side of Whidbey Island at Bells Beach</b> in Saratoga Passage. We had a grey whale come by feeding on the ghost shrimp close to shore while we were out in our kayaks. It was rolling and showing us its pectoral fins and staying in shallow water to feed.  It came within 40 fee of our kayaks while it was feeding. What an incredible experience. We were not able to get any pictures up close as we were focused on staying out of it's way and we were not able to identify it as it was too shallow to dive and show us its fluke. I will never forget this unexpected gift. In gratitude. -Kristin Carlson

There were reports of whales as we left Anacortes, so we took the scenic route through the San Juan Islands, then checked out Whale Rocks to see visiting Steller sea lions, and lots of harbor seals. Aha - received a report of Minke whales, so off towards <b>Hein Bank we saw two of the elusive Minke whales</b>, surfacing fairly frequently, in nice calm seas! As we headed back towards Lopez Island, several passengers caught sight of a blow and tail fluke behind us - YAY <b>a Humpback whale!</b>! So we turned around and caught several nice views of this whale (<b>possibly 2 whales</b>) .... before ultimately heading back to the dock with happy passengers. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 a.m. - I saw five and maybe six Orcas in Hood Canal</b>. They were traveling North, on the East side of the Canal, just before Hoodsport. At <b>Ayock Beach</b>, two hours later, (10:30) I saw one large male way ahead of five orcas all heading North. I gave up at Hama Hama River. There were two large ones, (males?), for sure, then two "normal" size and two juveniles. The best sighting was a <b>Lilliwaup Tide Flats parking area around 10 a.m</b>. just north of the Lilliwaup River. At this point they broke from their normal northward travel and turned toward shore, (west). Here the five started circling really close to shore in 10 to 12 feet of water for about 3 - 4 minutes. Close enough that you could hear their blows and see their movement under water. Amazing! No seals, fish or octopus seen. Then they just started swimming north again.  A lot of people observed the Orcas as they traveled north. One car would pull over and 10 would follow. A great day for whale watching on Hood Canal. -Harry Louch

<b>8:30-9:00 p.m. - 2 marine mammals black and white with fins.</b> They are breaching, tail slapping, making lots of noise out in the <b>middle of Dabob Bay</b>. There are two that we can see. Didn't have time to run and get binoculars to make better identification. To me, from this distance, looks like orca, but there are only two that we can see. Feeding. One went almost completely out of the water. Lots of tail slapping and heavy respirations. They were sort of apart, maybe 40 feet from each other, and then very close to each other and heading southeast as the light of day disappeared. -Kirie Pedersen

<b>7:00 p.m. - 4 Orca sighted , north end of Dabob Bay Hood canal</b>. 2 very large and 2 lesser, but still big whales. They moved rapidly south down the Hood Canal. They alternated swimming underwater and on top , spouting large plumes as the surfaced. -Todd Daugherty

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 a.m. - just north of Hoodsport.</b> Spotted <b>5 orcas on the far side of the canal</b> - at least one appeared pretty small. Watched them for 30 minutes - breaching, spyhopping, thrashing around (apparently hunting). They were moving north at a leisurely pace. Saw them again 3 hours later north of the Hamma Hamma River - still on the far side. The water was getting too choppy to see them well. -

I watched this <b>pod of 6 kill a sealion</b>. This individual mostly hung out, with occasional tail slaps while the smaller whales beat the sealion to death. Teaching the young orcas to kill a sealion. One large, and possibly another small male....They moved off northward with the body, which may have still been alive, but when I re-acquired them at <b>Malaspina Galleries</b>, I didn't see it any more. I did see the body drift past my location <b>(McConvey Rd, Gabriola, BC</b>) an hour or so later. (<i>The answer from Dave Ellifrit at the Center for Whale Research is: <b>T19B in the first pic and T19C with the long scar</b> on his back in the second</i>.) -Alan Daley, Gabriola, BC

This evening from <b>5:30 to 6:30</b> we were on scene with the <b>J16s in San Juan Channel</b>. First they were heading south, but then they did a big arc around, aiming momentarily for President's Channel before finally <b>heading north past Flattop towards Boundary Pass</b>. They were all traveling in a tight, slow-moving group. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The <b>J16's had been found off the west side of San Juan Island in the morning. By 1305, the J16's had moved slowly north past CWR </b>about a quarter mile off the reef. Ken and Dave left a while later to see the T's in Boundary Pass (Encounter 38-1). We ended that encounter at 1613 and decided to briefly check out the J16's who were reported to be heading east in Spieden Channel at that time. We arrived on scene at 1634 about a mile east of Battleship Rock. <b>The J16's milled some and went on a long dive before coming up on the north side of Spieden Channel just a little east of Sentinel Island</b>. We left the J16's soon afterward at 1652 as they moved closer to the Spieden Island shoreline and headed slowly east in a tight group. -Center for Whale Research Encounter 39

Half day sail with enthusiastic friends. Met the <b>J16's in Spieden Channel</b>. Close to shore swimming against a strong ebb. Steller sea lions grouped together and the J16's were acting like transients... silent underwater with a 180 degree direction change. Beautiful crisp blows and reflections in placid waters of Minke Pond. Clearing north of Flattop we headed home in the evening light. -Barbara Bender/David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

<b>3:35 p.m. - </b>We are out on a boat and spotted the <b>pod north of Lime Kiln</b>! Including at least one baby. -Kim Sharpe Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:05 p.m. - S4 calls &amp; echolocation on OrcaSound hydrophone</b>.
<br/><b>11:55 a.m. - just tuned in to Lime Kiln and hearing J pod</b>, loud vocalizations and echolocation. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spent some time with the <b>J16's on the west side</b>. J26 and J42 were bringing up the rear, south of Lime Kiln, while J16, J50, J36 and J52 lead the way, being very active and social, were heading north past Lime Kiln. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A large number of <b>transients had been found in the late morning off East Point</b>. Since the whales were still in the Patos Island area and seemed to be pointed toward Boundary Pass by early afternoon, Ken and Dave decided to go out and take a look. They left aboard Orcinus at 1355 and arrived on scene just a little southwest of the Patos Island Lighthouse on Alden Point at 1435. The T86A's, T100B's, T124A's, and the T101's minus T102 were in a fairly tight group heading slowly southwest pointed down Boundary Pass. The whales were active and were being social. A group consisting of T124A2A, T86A3, and T86A's newest calf T86A4 lagged a little behind... -Center for Whale Research Encounter 38.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>17 Biggs killer whales</b> being incredibly social. Started off with tons of tail lobbing and breaching from the kids, then they all got together in a big group and were almost stationary at the surface, rolling around on one another. We shut down and watched for a while and after a long dive they popped up right beside us! We got a really good look at <b>T86A's</b> overbite on her lower jaw and got to see one of the newest calves, <b>T86A4</b>. Won't forget that one anytime soon! -Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

There was a <b>T-party out in the Strait of Georgia today---and it included T86A4, the newest kiddo of T86A</b>.-Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>8:00 p.m. - Orcas in Hood Canal</b>? I just saw from the shore what looked to be about <b>4 Orcas just out from Potlatch</b> (Hood Canal), feeding. -Travis Hultquist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:10 a.m. - I saw two just North of Hoodsport</b>. Absolutely amazing!!! The first I have seen in the wild! -Chelsea Sendzik

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transients in Sansum Narrows about noon</b>, we encountered what looked like a family of <b>3 Orcas travelling south towards Burial Island</b> and beyond: Papa, Mama and Baby. I only had my lumix camera but managed to get one photo of the male. -Tamar Griggs

After the <b>J16's were found in Boundary Pass,</b> Dave left Snug Harbor in Orcinus at <b>1345 and arrived on scene off Bedwell Harbor at 1415. J36 and J52 were heading southwest toward Turn Point about a mile south of Tully Point on South Pender Island</b>. J26 was another three quarters of a mile to the east of J36 and J52 also heading slowly toward Turn Point. The other three J16's were reported to be much closer in to Bedwell Harbor...-Center for Whale Research Encounter 37.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

From today during our sail with the <b>J16's</b>. One of J36 breaching in front of the Center for Whale Research. They traveled rather quickly southbound with the ebb tide with occasional stops for fishing.
<br/><b>5:30 p.m. - We left the J16's off Pile Pt</b> - heading for home. We had the hydro in many times throughout the day. Very little talking - a few faint squeaks and echo.
<br/><b>4:04 p..m. - Passing Lime Kiln</b>. -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:15 p.m. - T18 and 19B's in Haro</b> today going north. Transients, aka "Bigg's Killer whales" (marine mammal eating ecotype)... <b>Two humpbacks were feeding the area</b> but the T's ignored them entirely.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>41 year-old, T018</b> She travels with the <b>T019's</b> with humpback 1/4 mile (if that) in background. We were with them today as they traveled north in <b>Haro Strait</b>. -Renee Beitzel

I took this on Monday from my Kayak:) I think there are<b> 4 of them 2 big ones and two smaller ones</b>. They were eating a seal, so I am assuming they are transient whales. They are so incredible!! They were at the <b>mouth of the Duckabush river between 2:30-3:30</b> on Monday. They headed up the canal toward Union about 3:40. -Jennifer Nehr

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/>
<b>8:15 p.m. - 4 orcas</b>. I was out paddle boarding on <b>Bellingham Bay</b> and was surprised by a pod of whales. They appeared to be casually traveling. I was paddle boarding, they surfaced near me (about 15-20 yards away). There was a young whale, 2 medium sized, and 1 large female. They seemed curious of me and were surfacing nearby. A powerboat approached approximately 200 yards away and they headed south. I then observed them approach a slow moving sailboat and surface near it. It appeared as if they were showing instructing the small whale. -Sam Stoner
