<h3><center>April 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>April 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>J Pod</b> came up Haro Strait past Lime Kiln Lighthouse in the mid afternoon. It was difficult to find the whales in the rough seas. Pictures are being sent to CWR for proof of presence. Some members of each of the J Pod family groups were seen, and babies and little kids seen and yes - Ruffles J1 (see above photo) and Granny J2. Blog post from that day: 'Checking in at the Light.'
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Making our way across the Strait of Georgia this morning, our ace whale spotter - Captain John - spotted blows in the vicinity of Deltaport and the Roberts Bank Coal terminal at <b>11:30</b>. As we have all been waiting anxiously for J Pod to arrive, we thought it might be them, however, it turned out to be a very active group of <b>7 Transients</b>. The group included <b>T99, T99A, T99B, T65A, T65A2</b> plus two other un-Id'ed youngsters (T65A3??), ??? The youngsters were very playful, with tail slaps, rolling around, lots of partial breaches, and several full forward breaches. Unfortunately, no vocals were detected on the hydrophone. No hunting was observed, although the group did several full changes of direction, and overall, seemed to be circling their way northbound through the Strait.

<b>J pod</b> foraging at <b>Turn Pt</b>, non-directional at <b>1800</b>.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach
<br/>*<br/>
I was at <b>lime kiln</b> and saw <b>J-pod</b> .... Ruffles &amp; Granny both present, and looked like a sprouter was on nursery duty!!. There was breaching, cartwheeling &amp; tail-slapping going on :)) Jeanne Hyde was also there taking pics and could literally ID them as they swam past ... very impressive!!! I still have goosebumps!!! Posted at <b>5:30pm</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:20 pm</b>: Just heard <b>S1's</b> on <b>Orcasound</b>.
<br/>Chrissy McLean, PTMSC, Pt. Townsend
<br/>*<br/>
Saw whales (<b>orcas</b>) off <b>Belleview Point</b> (NW San Juan Island), about <b>4:00pm</b>, but too far out to ID. Paul MacMahon (via facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Oh what JOY...to hear what I believe to be, our beloved<b> J pod</b> again (on the <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>) It is <b>3.30pm</b>, and the Orca are really serenading. Such a cacophony of brilliant sounds, some that I have never heard before. Love it !
<br/>Marie O'Shaughnessy, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
Picking up faint <b>calls </b>now <b>3:29 p.m.</b> PDT at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. Can they be SR's?!!
<br/>Suzy Roebling
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:28 pm</b>: Just started hearing <b>So. Resident calls</b> on <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b>! after nearly 2 months being gone, it's about time - listen to those whistles!!
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Members of <b>J pod </b>headed north close to shore---very close to shore!! <b>3:20 pm</b>...Nice!
<br/>Sandy Buckley (via facebook), San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/> 
I was heading west under the <b>Agate Pass [Bainbridge Island]</b> Bridge in my boat, and lo and behold <b>a gray whale</b> comes toward me just 50 yards in front of me. He or she was by himself heading east against the current. This was approximately <b>4:30</b> in the afternoon.
<br/><i>Update:</i> I notified you that I saw a Gray Whale underneath the Agate Pass bridge on April 30th around 4:30pm. After coming home and researching different whale possibilities within Puget Sound, I realized that I was wrong. It wasn't a gray and it wasn't an orca or a humpback. I don't believe it was a minke, because it seemed wider than a minke, more bulk. So I am not sure what it was. It had a small fin, it was dark gray, it was bulkier than minke's I've seen before and it was about the size of my boat which is 22 feet long.
<br/>Dianne Iverson
<br/>*<br/> 
John Herman called to report <b>a Gray whale</b> in <b>Skunk Bay</b>, N. Kitsap Peninsula, at <b>1:30 pm</b>. It was close to shore, in 20 - 30' of water moving very slowly north.
<br/>*<br/>
Stephen Hopkins of WA State Ferries and Captain of the ferry Wenatchee, called to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> in Puget Sound, 1/2 mile north of the mouth of the <b>Duwamish River</b> at<b> 12:10 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report of <b>a Gray whale</b> in <b>Skunk Bay,</b> N. Kitsap Peninsula at <b>7:55 am</b>, lounging around the bay. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 29, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
A single <b>gray south</b> of the Mabana Road (SW Camano Island) at <b>8PM</b>. It was out from shore and diving deep with the spout side lighted by the setting sun. Looked to be slowly moving south.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Two large marine animals headed north towards the opening of <b>Hood Canal</b>, spotted north of Port Gamble, about <b>5:30</b>. Gray whales? We did not see a dorsal fin and they were certainly much larger than the many harbor porpoises dipping through the sea at the same time. Harsh sun glare made it difficult to confirm.
<br/>Nancy Slick
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report of <b>2 Gray whales</b> cruising up and down the shoreline off W. Camano Island near the <b>Camano Island State Park</b> boat ramp at <b>5:26 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Chrissy McLean of the Port Townsend Marine Science Center relayed a report of <b>3 Transient orcas</b> at <b>10:45 am</b> off the NW side of <b>Patos Island</b>. There were also 10 - 12 sea lions in the vicinity. 
<br/>*<br/> 
A pair of <b>Dall's porpoise</b> just passed by the house traveling south from <b>Alki Point, 1:50pm</b>

<br/><br/>
The 12.15 pm Ocean Magic was out in all sorts of interesting weather this afternoon. Mika on board suddenly saw a dorsal fin at <b>Discovery and Chatham Islands</b>. It wasn't just one big dorsal fin of a male <b>Orca</b>, who appeared to be <b>T87</b>, but another smaller one popped up, a female, who possibly might be <b>T88</b>, based on the saddle patch. Perhaps others out there might know for sure. At first I thought it looked like T20 and T21, but T87's notch at the top end of his dorsal fin is much larger, so the consensus was T87. 
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic, 'Prince of Whales', Victoria.
<br/>*<br/> 
We found <b>gray whale #383</b> swimming closely with <b>another</b>, SE of <b>Gedney Island</b> around <b>10am</b>. The pair were then joined by <b>a third whale</b> who seemed a little on the thin side--looked to me like it had some hollowing behind the blow hole. Stayed with the three of them for close to an hour, during which time we also saw two or three other grays blowing in the distance. Just as we were about to leave, with #383 and company heading off to the SE toward Everett, <b>Patch </b>surfaced near us coming from the other direction!
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Victoria Clipper
<br/>*<br/>
Saw another solo adult <b>grey feeding</b> in <b>Elger Bay</b> around <b>7:00</b> last night. Several impressive blows this time. He motored off heading toward the south end of the island just before 7:30.
<br/>Peter DeLuca, Camano Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
I was working out in the yard along the bluff this afternoon about <b>4:20 PM</b> when I heard the familiar "whoosh". The tide was in and a single gray came by close to shore. He was traveling fairly fast until got just south of Mabana Road (<b>SW Camano Island</b>), then stopped to feed.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>2:15 PM</b>, I was flying towards Everett and spotted <b>two gray whales</b> feeding by the big marine marker west of <b>Everett</b>. The second sighting was again flying near Everett at 5 PM and watching 3 gray whales feeding off of Jetty Island (NW of Everett). I was not able to ID the whales. I've noticed since the last orca attacks we've had very little feeding activity in the Langley area. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the orcas or if the whales have just moved on?
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley
<br/>*<br/>
We had <b>a Gray whale</b> feeding from the <b>Pt No Pt</b> Lighthouse towards Hansville store this morning. Left the area about <b>10am</b>, heading west.
<br/>Patty Michak, MarineView Fisheries Consulting, Inc., hansville, WA 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
My neighbor alerted me to a whale just north south of Strawberry point (<b>Saratoga Passage</b>) around <b>6:30pm</b>. We followed it with my camera until around 7 and thought you might enjoy some of the images. 
<br/>Sandy, SandyByers.com PSA PSWC NPS AFC, Oak Harbor, WA
<br/>*<br/>
We were treated to quite a show, this evening at <b>Mariners Cove, Oak Harbor</b> [beach theatre] with featured attraction, <b>one gray whale</b>. Putting on quite a display for all in attendence. First, seen spout was at <b>6PM</b>; 1/4 mile southwest of Mariners Cove, located, N.E. Whidbey Is. It was feeding time. Watched, from the shoreline, gray, feed on ghost/sand shrimp in estimated 6 to 8 feet max, of water. Two "gray whale lengths" [new navigation term] or 75 to 85 feet out from beach. It would spout, then spiral/twist onto its right side to feed. Once, on its side, you could see most of its body a couple of feet above water, with only head and spine as it tapers towards fluke/tail submerged. Half its fluke and entire flipper exposed. Then, it would reverse spiral to right itself, spout, and repeat, over and over. Feeding was laid back, without much commotion/swirling activity. Gray, slowly moved N.E. to right in front of Mariners Cove, constantly feeding. Several times in the shallows, gray would display its entire tail out of the water. Have only seen this when they dive. Never in shallow water. At one point, gray came within/less? than one "whale length" from shore with its head up. At Cove canal entrance, it turned and headed out to deeper water. Then, came back in to feed for awhile, in front of our house. At around <b>8:20PM</b> of this 2 hour twenty minute feature show, saw one last spout, then full fluke deep dive good bye. In mid channel heading south towards Camano's Rocky Point.
<br/>Robert Stonefelt
<br/>*<br/>
Susie Richards of S.E.A. reported <b>two gray whales</b> in <b>Possession Sound</b> just before <b>noon </b>today, heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
Judy Roupe called Orca Network about <b>a gray whale</b> passing <b>Pt. No Point</b>, Kitsap Peninsula, headed north about <b>10 AM</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>9:30 this AM</b>, I spotted <b>a lone gray</b> spout in front of the house as it moved rapidly northwest to <b>Mabana</b>. The tide was out a ways so the whale was diving deep off the drop off. It stopped to feed for a short while off the Mabana Road, but didn't linger.

<br/><br/>
While in route to <b>Clinton </b>on the 8:30 a.m. ferry and singing out "Here Whale" repeatedly with my 2 year old grandson Myles, we saw a <b>single gray whale</b> spout but not enough whale to determine size, etc. Apx<b> 8:35 a.m.</b> The whale was in between both ferries heading towards Clinton.

Suzanne Grenager saw <b>3 orcas</b> in <b>Monterey Bay CA</b> (from a motel on Cannery Row) - 1 at <b>7 am</b>, <b>2 more at 8:30 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
This <b>[gray] whale</b> was feeding closely together with a second whale (both adult) in 6-10 ft of water from <b>11:30 to 6:00 pm</b> in a larger area off <b>Jetty Island / Snohomish estuary</b>. There was a third whale in their vicinity for all this time and a fourth joint just after noon to stay to the end of our sighting. All <b>four whales</b> moved into deeper water after <b>6 pm</b> and seemed to be diving and milling around between Jetty island and Gedney. There was a ton of plankton in the water - I went diving to see what they might be after. No visible sign of gauges in the sediment but my face was literally prickled with plankton, very poor visibility and I could hardly even see my view finder. Might be worth taking some water samples to see if there is any special development of plankton in the large estuarine area there... The whales definitely seem to like it there - feeding galore.... very stinky breaths....
<br/>Florian Graner 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Two gray whales</b> heading south from <b>Bells Beach</b> this evening <b>8:00-ish</b>. We heard them blowing and got to see some spines and then a tail in the air at one point-that was a thrill! 
<br/>The Bells Beach Neighbors 
<br/>*<br/>
I have a second hand report from <b>Pt. Defiance</b>. One of the regulars from the boathouse (Bob) was fishing off the clay banks when <b>a grey</b> surfaced next to his boat. About 15ft away. The grey was very skinny.
<br/>Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Beginning to hear <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> at <b>1:56 am</b> PDT, sounds like the Transients.
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Florida 
<br/>*<br/> 
I didn't see it myself, but passengers on the 6p Cathlamet (<b>Clinton/Mukilteo ferry</b>) reported <b>a gray whale</b> off its stern.
<br/>Sharen Heath, LANGLEY 
<br/>*<br/>
Barry Alsos called to report<b> a Gray whale</b> in Samish Bay, from <b>3 - 5 pm</b>. The whale made 4 circular passes and came close to shore.
<br/>*<br/>
Is this Patch! If so, he's heading north into <b>Port Susan</b> about 30 yards off shore. He's being very lazy today - strolling real slow and laying on his back for most of time:) <b>7:05 am</b>
<i>hmm - never heard of a gray whale laying on its back unless it was being attacked by orcas or was floating dead - are you sure of this description?!
</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>One gray</b> heading north through <b>Port Susan </b>at<b> 1:30</b> He put on quite a show for all the spectators at <b>Tulalip Shores</b>. Rolling around and sticking his tail out of the water numerous times. He appeared to have a chunk out of his back fluke that was capped with a white mark. <b>4:15 gray whale</b> coming back through Tulalip Shores. Now heading south out of Port Susan. Rolling and eating.
<br/>Tamra Nelson (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
Florian Graner also reported 5 Harbor porpoise mid-channel between Gedney/Hat Island &amp; Jetty Island from 11:15 - 11:30 am.
<br/>*<br/>
Ron Hirschi of Marrowstone Island called to report <b>one Gray whale</b> off the north end of <b>Marrowstone Island</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Jill Hein of Coupeville called to report <b>Gray whale #531</b> off <b>Camano Head</b>, S. Camano Island at<b> 2:52 pm</b>, heading N. <b>Three other grays</b> were observed off Everett, one of them possibly Patch. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 24, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Ron Hirschi of Marrowstone Island called to report <b>3 Dall's porpoise</b> off <b>Marrowstone Island</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report of <b>one Gray whale</b> heading north in mid-<b>Saratoga Passage</b> between Madrona, Camano Island, and Coupeville, Whidbey Island at <b>4:15 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Ann Casey, Carol Plunkett and Ann Moeller saw <b>a gray whale</b> cruise by the tip of <b>Marrowstone Island</b>, 50' offshore, feeding at <b>2:30 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>3:15 PM</b>, while hiking Lawson bluff on <b>Sucia Island</b>, [NW of Orcas Island] friends and I sighted two distinct groups of <b>Orcas</b>. They were traveling southwest from the direction of Alden Bank about a third of the way offshore from Patos Island. The 1st group was composed of about three females followed by another group of 3 to 4 females with possibly a juvenile and following them was a large male with one or two females. The 2nd group was about a mile behind them. They also were broken up into 3 groups with about 3 females, followed by four females and then a really large male with a female and it appeared to have a much smaller orca between or right next to them. They were traveling steadily and didn't appear to be feeding. We watched them with a monocular until they disappeared from sight . They were going in the direction of Boundary Pass.
<br/>Marianne M Banks 
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>Orca </b>whales are right out across from us off the east point of <b>Speiden </b>at <b>7pm</b>. We are no experts but it looks as if it was just 1 Orca with a calf as far as we could tell from here. They headed off to Orcas and Yellow island. 
<br/>Report forwarded by Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Horace, a Beam Reach student, called in a report of <b>12 - 16 unidentified orcas</b>, including 1 male, between <b>Jones Island and San Juan Island</b> at <b>6:30 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
A lone <b>[gray] whale</b> off the northern beach of <b>Marrowstone Island</b>. I spotted the lone whale on the eastern side of the north beach at about <b>1:40</b> and continued to observe it for 35 minutes as it slowly traversed the entire northern side of the island traveling from east to west. On a subsequent flight I observed it an hour later going the opposite direction almost to the northeastern corner by the light house. The attached pictures show how close to shore it was. It kept this distance the entire length of the island without stopping accept once when it stopped in even shallower water for about about 5 minutes. I presumed it was feeding during that period.
<br/>Randy Sprague 
<br/>*<br/> 
At about <b>1:30 PM</b> I spotted a lone whale, likely a <b>gray</b>, off of East Beach on <b>Marrowstone Island</b>. It swam slowly and parallel to the beach, maybe 100 yards of shore, heading north. I easily walked along and kept up with it. Fantastic.
<br/>Cheryl M.
<br/>*<br/>
Spotted a lone <b>grey whale</b> feeding in deeper water in <b>Elger Bay</b> around <b>noon</b>.
<br/>Peter DeLuca, Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
I'm doing some naturalist work for Victoria Clipper this season, and we went out today looking for <b>grays </b>en route to Coupeville. We saw <b>#383</b> and another whale surfacing and diving together just west of the <b>Possession Point</b> buoy between <b>10-11 am</b>. We ran into another pair off the mouth of <b>Penn Cove</b> around <b>noon </b>(one of whom *might* have been Patch but I couldn't get a positive ID), and as we left Coupeville at<b> 2:30</b> saw yet another blowing along the north shore of Penn Cove. We saw "Dubknuck" a little SE of <b>Gedney Island</b>. There were a <b>couple other grays</b> blowing in the distance, one toward the <b>Tulalip Reservation</b> and one way over south of the <b>Everett waterfront</b>.

<b>April 23, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
We saw <b>#356</b>, but I'm not sure whether that was off Possession Point or Penn Cove.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond 
<br/>*<br/>
Just received GPS notifications from Ken Balcomb &amp; crew conducting the above study - they are with <b>orcas </b>south of <b>Carmel Bay, CA</b>, heading south at <b>noon </b>today.
<br/>*<br/>
This morning at <b>5:00 AM</b>, we awoke to hear <b>a gray whale</b> feeding in the shallow waters NW of <b>Langley</b>. The whale stayed for about 25 minutes circling back for more. It then headed out to the deeper water past the drop-off swimming towards downtown Langley. We could see its fluke in the dawn, as it continued to dive deep swimming to the SE.

<b>5 transients T36A, T36A1, T65A, T65A2, T65A3</b>-(not in current ID book - born in 2007) were seen in <b>President Channel</b> (west of Orcas Is.). T65A3 has an interesting saddle patch for a transient. While most are closed saddles this whale T65A3 appears to have an open saddle on his/her right side. T64A has a distinct notch not only at the top of the trailing edge of her dorsal fin but also on the edge of her fluke.

Jeff LaMarche of Eagle Wing Tours called to report a pod of <b>4 Transient orcas</b> north of <b>Orcas Island</b> at Parker Reef, heading west at <b>4:45 pm</b>. The pod was all females, none of which looked familiar to him. They had been off Matia Island earlier and took down a Harbor seal.
<br/>*<br/>
The last time these <b>transients </b>came by our front window overlooking <b>Sucia Island</b>. It was during my morning cup of coffee a couple of weeks ago. Now I'm home for lunch (<b>2:25 pm</b>) and there they are. Earlier today they were off Yellow Island, traveling up to Sucia in about five hours.

Mira Lutz of Anacortes called to report a <b>small Gray whale</b> off <b>Rosario Beach, Deception Pass State Park</b> at <b>4:25 pm</b> - it had apparently been seen by others and had been there several hours. She watched it until around <b>7 pm</b> - it remained about 20' offshore in 6' of water, swimming back and forth but not feeding. At around 7 pm it swam off.
<br/>*<br/>
Florian Graner of Freeland called to report <b>7 Gray whales</b> in the <b>Everett/Hat Island</b> area! They had 5 Grays between Everett &amp; Hat/Gedney Island at <b>5:35 pm</b>, milling &amp; feeding in deeper water; and a mom and calf off Jetty Island at 4:15 pm in 6 - 8' of water.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:55 pm:</b> Just watched <b>a [gray] whale</b> from the beach on <b>Camano Island, Madrona beach</b> area - watched and listened and it was so cool - was just too far away for me to get a photo of it though.

While walking my dogs on the beach on Thursday afternoon at <b>2:30 pm</b>, we were entertained by a <b>large gray whale</b> about 20 yards away. It stayed close into shore for about 10 minutes, coming to the surface with spectacular blows half a dozen times. It then moved rapidly away to the north. We saw it near Greenbank at the foot of Labrador Lane.

I was out with Island Adventures today. We saw <b>five gray whales</b> feeding between the jetty and the Mission Beach marker about noon (<b>Everett area</b>). They were feeding in shallow water, so we saw lots of splashing, pecs and flukes. About <b>1 p.m.</b>, we got some good looks at another gray feeding in the tide line near the south end of Hat.

<b>Gray whale</b> sighting right off the Lakota Beach shore (between Dumas and Poverty Bays) in <b>Federal Way</b> this morning around <b>7:45am</b>. It appeared to be feeding and making its way South toward Dash Point. We rarely get whales through this channel and when we do they are often on the other side near Maury and Vashon Islands.

At <b>10:30am</b> we heard <b>gray whale</b> blows close in along <b>Tulalip Shores</b>. We heard blows heading south along shore for about 5 minutes. Then we caught sight of one gray as he moved out away from shore, reversed direction and headed north. We watched as the whale headed toward Spee-be-dah bay. There he followed the shore line, rolling around and feeding. At <b>11:30am</b>, we lost sight of the whale, as it rounded the point on the north end of Spee-bi-dah.

About <b>7 PM, 2 grays</b> passed by (<b>SW Camano Island</b>) heading northwest. The tide was fairly low, so they were out a ways. They stopped for a leisurely late dinner off the spit at Mabana Road. Lots of of spouts and rolling, with only occasional pec fins. Beautiful calm sunny evening so great visibility, but too far away for photos.

<br/><br/>
Mouth of <b>Quillayute River</b>, <b>single male orca</b> just beyond the end of the navigational jetty. The whale was sitting relatively motionless in 25 ft of water in one of the narrowest parts of the river's mouth. We presume it was hunting seals and/or sea lions, due to their abundance in the estuary. We were working from a small boat and as we turned the boat around to re-enter the river, a large dorsal fin rose about 3-4' up out of the water less than 20' behind our boat. As we continued up the river we saw the dorsal break the surface one additional time in the same location. It was late afternoon (<b>~4:30 pm</b>) approaching high tide.

Soon we had a confirmed sighting of <b>transients </b>in the area we expected and headed south towards <b>Partridge</b>. And then the waiting began. Transients can dive for up to 5-7 minutes and we waited - and waited - and waited. And then a burst of excitement from the passengers as they spotted one dorsal fin. And another, and another. We had found <b>6 transients</b>, and they were in no hurry to go anywhere, as they meandered this way and that. As we got a bit closer, we were able to identify the whales as one we have been seeing a lot of lately-<b>T87 </b>and family. T87 is a big male with a very distinctive square cut notch on his dorsal fin. Soon two juvenile transients got a little playful and began to roll on each other and slap the water with their tails.

Brad Hanson and Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC in Seattle were with a pod of <b>Transient orcas</b> in <b>Puget Sound</b> today. They found them at <b>12:25</b> heading up into Rich Passage. They went from Rich Passage up through Port Orchard to Agate Pass, then turned around and headed back south. At 3:30 pm they were back out in the middle of Puget Sound, west of Elliott Bay and headed south, then turned around and headed NE.
<br/>*<br/> 
I saw a pod of <b>orcas </b>today at <b>12:45</b> in Rich Passage at south side of <b>Bainbridge Island</b> - they were heading west toward Bremerton. It looked like there were 5 or 6 of them of various sizes, at least one male.

<b>Transient orcas</b> near <b>Partridge Pt.</b> (NW Whidbey Island) going south in <b>mid afternoon</b>. I was on Maya's Charters and when we arrived on scene we could see that T87 and T88 were ahead of and to the west of the other five whales <b>T124, T124D, T124E, T90 and T90B. T87 and T88 </b>turned toward the southwest while the other group moved further to the east and continued going south. We were there a short time and when we left I would say that T87 and T88 were at least 2 miles from the group of five.

<b>8:45 pm:</b> Just now began hearing a few <b>calls/whistles</b> on the <b>Pt. Townsend hydrophones</b> - maybe one of the groups of Transients that has been in &amp; out of Admiralty Inlet today? They don't quite sound like the usual Transient or Resident calls, but are definitely some kind of cetacean call/whistle. Calls stopped for awhile, then started again at <b>9:27 pm</b>, for another 20 minutes. And again at <b>9:55 pm</b>.

Jill Hein found the<b> Transient orcas</b> off <b>NW Whidbey Island</b> at <b>1:55 pm</b>, they were out off <b>Pt. Partridge</b>, heading south. By 2:35 pm they were off Ebey's Landing, Central/West Whidbey Island still heading south slowly, and at 3 pm they were about 1 mile N of Ft. Worden (NW of Port Townsend) continuing south. I watched 3 dorsals all the way past the Steller haulout east of Marrowstone, but they went right on by. She then sent this update: Two were traveling together, a single one several hundred yards behind. They were not showing themselves very often. I did not see T87 at any time from Pt. Wilson south. The three were heading south east, perhaps towards Bush Point, very hard to tell. 
<br/>*<br/>
On our 1st day out, Beam Reach student Kathryn spotted KW fins. We've ID'd them as about<b> 5 transients</b>, inc 1 male. They're headed SE so listen on Port Townsend hydrophone today.
From info transmitted by their SPOT tracking device, they were with the whales beginning at 8:38 am off the s<b>outh tip of San Juan Island</b> (Latitude:48.41964, Longitude: -123.09269) traveling SE with the pod until 2:20 pm, off <b>Central/West Whidbey Island </b>(Latitude:48.20447, Longitude:-122.80058).
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach
<br/>*<br/>
Saw <b>5 Orcas</b> off shore north of <b>Partridge Point</b> (at the end of Libby Road) at <b>2:00 PM</b>. There was one large male, others of normal size and quite a small one in the group, too. They were followed by some sort of whale watching boat, with lots of people standing up looking. The whale watching boat was literally right along side of the whales. Then there was a second smaller boat that passed the WWB and seemed to pursue the whales more closely as they disappeared from view. The Whale Watching Boat suddenly backed off and returned toward Anacortes about 2:20.

Port Gardner East of Hat Island: <b>2 gray whales</b> were slowly heading north, diving and one spyhopped a few times around <b>1pm </b>. They appeared to be a mother and a calf or juvenile pair. At <b>2:50pm</b> we were sailing south and encountered <b>a gray whale</b> (positive ID #723 - see above photo) in <b>Possession Sound</b> off Glendale travelling north at a good pace and diving. These whales were the first whale sightings for 3 of my friends and the spyhopping was definitely the highlight of the day!

We had more <b>Transients </b>(the mammal eating Orcas) and followed them almost to <b>Pt. Townsend</b>. The were beautifully framed by Mt. Baker. The number of Transient sightings this year has been amazing. We don't know why. Are there more of them than before? My feeling is that we are seeing them more often because of better communication between the members of the whale watching community. I include not only the commercial whale watchers, but the scientific community and any number of recreational whale watchers. The communication has increased through channels like Facebook (Yes!) and Orcanet. The hydrophones have helped and of course, more boats and people than ever before are aware that they might be out there. We are thinking of them more. The Ts have no shortage of food, like our Resident Orcas, the salmon eaters sometimes face. We have a zillion seals out there. Just some random thoughts.

I saw Ken's report on OrcaNet and thought I'd contribute some pictures of those <b>orcas </b>that were sighted today (in <b>Monterey Bay</b>). We kept our distance because we knew researchers were there, so the photos are not too great. I hope you can possibly get some ID's from them. A male has a pretty good nick about halfway down his dorsal fin (see photo above).

We received reports from the GPS on Ken Balcomb's Center for Whale Research boat that is currently in <b>Monterey Bay, CA</b>. They were with <b>orcas </b>from <b>10:54 am - 11:39 am</b>, in the middle of <b>Monterey Bay</b> off the deep underwater canyons midway between Monterey and Santa Cruise.

I was down on our beach doing a low tide walk about <b>1 PM</b> today, when I heard and saw the Mystic Sea stopped out in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>. They were with <b>one gray</b> (off SW Camano Isl). Later, about <b>4 PM</b>, I was sitting out on our deck and spotted a dark back out a ways off our beach. I watched it for some time and saw several rolls, but only one weak blow and no tail flukes. It was very calm and the gray's blows usually echo across the water. The whale was fairly dark, seemed small, but bigger than a porpoise and definitely not an Orca.

<br/><i>The 2nd whale does sound like it could possibly have been a Minke - we get them every once in awhile in Saratoga Passage, but it is rare - sb.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:50 am</b>: We just saw <b>Patch </b>between the south end of Hat Island and the jetty. Feeding in 30 or so feet of water. He appeared no worse for wear after being attacked by orcas last Sunday.

She posted a video of the whale feeding (it looks like the same whale reported &amp; photographed in Crescent Harbor over the past week), and another video after the tide went out, showing the feeding pits left by the whale as it sucked up mud and ghost shrimp, and she even found some shrimp it had left behind! Judging by the number of ghost shrimp holes in the video, it appears this whale has found a good spot to find food, which is always good news! These videos are also posted on our Orca Network Facebook Page - MANY THANKS to Mary Jo for providing this instant, wonderful look into a Gray whale having breakfast!

Joan Lopez sent me images that she took of the unidentified female who was associated with T103 off <b>Victoria</b>. Graeme Ellis thought that the unknown whale might be <b>CA58</b>. He is correct! CA58 was first photographed in Monterey Bay by Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whalewatch in May of 1993. Nancy has seen her in Monterey more recently. VERY interesting that CA58 was seen off your area. Quite a few of our California transients are showing up there!

On the way to the boat today, we got wind of <b>Orcas </b>off the <b>Victoria Waterfront</b>. By the time we got there, a few other boats were on the scene, but soon left. It's great to have so few boats out this time of the year. The male is <b>T103</b>, but the female is at this time unidentified.

I was out on the Ocean Magic vessel today and we found <b>two Transients</b> around <b>1 pm</b> traveling together, about 2 miles south and west of <b>Victoria</b>. They appeared to be resting initially then the female took off in haste chasing something then circled back toward the male. Their behaviour seemed to indicate that they had taken down a prey item and each whale would dive one at a time, and remain below the surface , while the other remained at the surface. Were they sharing their meal I wonder ? Looks like I had ID correctly, <b>T 103</b> as the male - confirmed by Jeanne Hyde.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>1458</b>:<b> Transient calls</b> being heard (on <b>OrcaSound hydrophones</b>). It's <b>Pender T-14</b> - he is the only one in here today as far as I know - more out in the Strait. I started hearing him this morning at about 8:30 then again at about noon. He ended up by Halibut Island and then has come back south. Is currently (3 pm) several miles from shore 1/2 between LK and OS Hydrophones - pretty cool!

We encountered the <b>T124's</b> this <b>afternoon </b>a couple of miles South East of <b>Albert Head BC</b> traveling tightly towards William head. As we followed the pod we observed a number of tail slaps, tail flukes, pectoral waves as the Orcas were in a very playful mood. We followed the Orcas for a while and left them at 4.00pm just off William Head.

<b>Orcas </b>observed at approx. <b>11:10am</b>, Whale Point Research Cabin, UC Big Creek Reserve, <b>Big Sur, CA</b> (North 36 degrees 1'30', West 121 31'26"). 11 individuals in a mixed sex group traveling north-northwest. Approx. 5 females, 6 males (2 males with very large dorsal fins) The animals were traveling abreast and surfacing more or less simultaneously. This occurred concurrent with a large (60-75 individuals) pod of Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) also traveling north. Another group of dolphins (likely Delphinus) were sighted at approximately 1:30pm feeding and breeching vigorously. This may have been the same group. There were also two males traveling together some distance from this main pod, also north. The main pod (11 individuals) was approximately 1.5-2km off shore.

We are watching a whale right from the deck of the WorldMark Resort (west side of Discovery Bay), near <b>Port Townsend</b>, WA. The whale is located in the cove just south of the resort. It has been hanging around since before <b>9:00 a.m</b>. We can only say that it looks to be a <b>humpback</b>, as we've seen the "point" on the back of it when it dives (this sounds more like a Gray whale to us). We believe there is only one, and it might be feeding here. It's just hanging out with us enjoying a beautiful Western Washington morning. Unfortunately it's too quick for us to get a picture of it yet, but we are trying. Sincerely,

We heard there was a large group of transients at <b>Race Rocks</b> headed east, towards Friday Harbor. We took the MV Sea Lion south past Long Island. Dorsal fins and blows were finally in the distance. Upon getting there, we identified about <b>12 transients</b>, a large group for stealthy marine mammal eating Orcas.

WOW what a day on the water for <b>Transients </b>again - we had a BIG group south and west of<b> Race Rocks</b> initially and they weren't going anywhere. They were seen lolly-gagging around with behaviours that looked like Southern Resident behaviours. They were breaching, spyhopping, tail-lobbing, backward swimming, and generally greeting one another socially. <b>T63 </b>was really into greeting all those females out there. If we hadn't been able to ID 'Chainsaw, T63, right away and Pender, T14 off by himself it would have looked like SR's as there were four big male Dorsal fins among all those females and youngsters. I believe we had at least <b>T30's</b> again and <b>T172</b>, and the <b>T124's </b>and the new calf. <b>T10 </b>and <b>T10B</b>. There were others, but hard to count. <b>Perhaps 25+</b>.

Oh those <b>Transients </b>just keep showing up. Amazing to see <b>15 or more</b> traveling together from the west, Albert Head area, where they were originally picked up this <b>am</b>. They were moving fast toward San Juan Island when we in the yellow zodiac, picked them up around <b>2pm</b>, south and east of <b>Trail island</b>. They seemed to be very happy socializing with several tail slaps, and spyhops. There were two big males, one easily ID as <b>T87</b>, with that familiar divot out of the trailing edge of his dorsal fin. <b>T30's </b>came to mind when I looked at the other male, but not sure as we were more than 150 metres away.

T88 was also in there, but I'll leave the rest of the IDs to someone else who is more familiar with transients than I am! They were fairly active with several big spyhops and tailslaps as well as some rolling at the surface. See more photos on Monika's blog here.

Heard from two neighbors, <b>a gray</b> passed by <b>Mariners Cove</b>, near Oak Harbor at around <b>6:30AM</b> this morning. I saw a full length gray whale on its side with both its flipper and fluke/tail, out of the water right out "IN THE FRONT YARD." AMAZING STUFF! Time was <b>3:15PM</b> with a 10.6' high tide at 6:30PM. Got boat out to whale watch. What started as an afternoon snack, became a full on 4 hour feed. It is a right sided feeder of sand shrimp. Meaning, when it feeds/suctions shrimp, it is always doing so on its right side. During the entire 4 hour feed, there was only a handful of swirling activity. Always, close to shore within 100' at all times.
At <b>7:30PM</b>, after 4 hours of feeding, gray made it down at a bay near <b>Polnell Pt.</b>

We live at the south end of <b>Camano</b>, facing south to Langley. Today at <b>12:30</b>, we saw <b>two greys</b> swimming west/northwest, very close together. They were so close together, I thought they were one until I blew up the image on the computer. After this photo, one at a time would come up for air. They were moving so slow, sometimes they did not move at all between breaths, and many time they did not blow at all. They seemed very lethargic; we have noticed this behavior the last 3-4 days. Sometimes they don't even dive, they just hang on the surface of the water. Driving northwest to the beach at Wilkes Gary (about 1/2 way between our place on Gull Way and Pebble Beach), we watched them continue in the same direction, still moving extremely slow. In the third photo, there are once again two whales, I think, but so close together they look like one. What is the meaning of this behavior, moving so close, so slow, and staying on the surface?
<br/>Peg Boley, Camano Island
<br/><i>Our guess is that these whales were resting, rather than actively feeding or traveling. We do have other reports and photos of two or three Grays moving very close together. But it is interesting that in Robert's report above, the feeding whale he was watching was also moving slowly - sb </i>
<br/>*<br/>
Just before <b>11 am</b> we saw a <b>Gray whale</b> close in to shore along the boach launch at <b>Redondo</b> [near Tacoma] heading south to north.

Orca Network received a call from Jennifer Barwick at <b>3:50 pm</b>, she was observing <b>a Gray whale</b> 30' off <b>Arroyo Beach</b> in West Seattle in very shallow water. She said it was breathing and its tail was moving, but it seemed to be staying in one place. We called Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales who is also a NOAA Fisheries trained Marine Mammal Stranding volunteer who lives near there, and he arrived on scene at approximately <b>4 pm</b>. He and Jennifer continued to observe the whale, and it <b>stopped breathing and moving</b> by around 4 pm. The initial exam showed it is a <b>33' long female</b>, looking thin, but no obvious signs of trauma or cause of death. This is the 3rd Gray whale to die in inland waters over the past 5 days, two others washed up on April 4th - one in Shelton, WA and one off Sooke, B.C. So far, it appears all five of these whales were undernourished.

We spotted what appeared to be <b>four Orcas</b> in mid-channel of <b>Port Susan</b> off Tulalip Shores around <b>4:30 PM</b>. We watched two animals traveling north, together, porpoising repeatedly and quickly, then diving for several minutes at a time. They also seemed to stop, circle along the top of the water for a few minutes, then continue their northward travel. After perhaps five minutes watching them, we noticed a third and fourth animal that seemed to be herding anything in the vicinity back toward the two we first spotted. The distance only increased while we watched, as the group neared the cliff north of Spee-bi-dah. They then reversed direction, and headed south where we watched them repeat the porpoising, then diving behavior. None ever breached the surface to show us their whole body, but they appeared significantly larger than Dall's porpoises that we have previously seen. We wondered if this was part of the infamous gang that may have attacked Patch, as previously reported. We will watch for other reports to see if we get any further confirmation of what type of cetaceans we have been observing.

They estimated the location to be just north and east of the Burton Peninsula and closer to Maury Island than to Vashon proper (so just inside inner Quatermaster Harbor). They saw only the one plume but guessed that the whale was heading south. No binoculars. 
We rendezvoused with them at Dockton park. Approximately 30 minutes after the first sighting, the five of us saw a single tall spout/plume emerge from just south and east of the Burton Peninsula, about equidistant between the peninsula and Maury. The plume was approximately 15 feet tall. No further sightings were observed. Conditions were sunny and somewhat windy. Can't help but wonder if this was the Arroyo Beach whale.

One, very small <b>Gray Whale</b> (estimated about 20 ft). <b>Sinclair Inlet</b> by Right Creek (west of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard)from <b>6:50 to 7:15pm</b>. Visible from freeway. It appeared to be circling, but would have needed to be traveling out as the other way toward Gorst is a dead end. It appeared to be feeding, but I'm not sure exactly. It was diving and spouting often. My family has lived in this area for about 20 years and have never seen any whales in the area, it was very strange. As I've heard, usually they only appear here when sick or abandoned. Something else to note is that the area it swam in was known to be fairly shallow, the whale area past the shipyard toward Gorst at deepest is about 30 feet.

I saw <b>a Grey whale</b> just off <b>Bremerton Navy ship yard</b>. I clearly saw it as broke the surface 3 times breathing each time at maybe 2-3 minute intervals. It was heading away from the ship yard toward the inlet.

Around <b>230 pm</b> we (Greg Sivertsen, Eric Rogers, and I) spotted two spouts within 40 yards of Lovejoy Point in <b>Penn Cove</b> while paddling our surfskis. The <b>[gray] whales</b> were within 100 ft of two female kayakers. We were about 300 yards away and approaching from Long Point. We paddled our surf skis quickly toward the last spotting but did not see any more activity. We spoke to the two female kayakers and they were very excited as one of them had a gray surface within 20 feet of her boat! Based on your reports, it seems the two grays probably went right under us and back around to feed later in the day at Snakelum Point.

<b>12:30 PM</b>. Spotted <b>a grey whale</b> surfacing about 150 yds. from the boat launch on Monroe Landing. Was sitting on my deck putting my shoes on to go play tennis and got "delayed". We saw it several more times heading West towards the end of 
<b>Penn Cove</b> where we saw a grey whale a couple weeks ago. Lost sight of it I think near the mussel rafts. Still to see the whales at my work place but jealous of the many sighting at Seaplane base last week ! Our harbormaster took some great shots and I got them forwarded to me. I will try to attach them. They were taken last week near the Navy Marina in Crescent Harbor (see above photo).

About <b>12:30 p.m.</b>, my first spotting was a weak blow at the northern tip of Cooper Point (<b>Olympia, WA</b>). The <b>[gray] whale</b> then did a very slow surfacing series heading north toward Harstene Island/Squaxin Island. It then turned around and headed back toward the south - but I lost track of it about halfway between the islands and the tip of Cooper Point. It never surfaced much - only slightly cresting the water. I have not seen it since, but keep looking. I have a few far-away photos that show the spine, but they aren't very good - because it was too far away. I sent them to Cascadia Research.

We left the (<b>Transient orca</b>) whales about <b>1845 </b>mid-Saratoga Passage - they were in the middle of preying on a harbor seal - this was at least the second one since you got us on them a little after 1400 - we observed the first harbor seal predation just before they headed into Penn Cove. Then they split up in Penn Cove for a while with one sub-group killing something small - we collected tissue fragments and will have to run the genetics.
Not surprisingly, it was the same group seen on Saturday: <b>T87, T88, T90,T90B, T124, T124E, and T124D</b>.

We received good news that one of the Whale Watch boats had spotted <b>Patch</b> off <b>S. Gedney Island</b> with <b>3 other Gray whales</b>, and he seemed to be ok!. 
<br/>*<br/>
I was out there watching the transients on Island Explorer 3. We picked up the <b>orcas </b>at about <b>11:30</b> - just south of the <b>Clinton ferry dock</b>. There were two groups - one consisting of six or so whales (including a youngster); the second "group" was a large male (T87, we think) and at least one smaller whale. T87 and friends lagged a half-mile or so behind the other group. We left the orcas just north of Camano head - - right before they encountered Patch. We heard about the encounter and tried to zip back up there, but didn't make it in time to see any action - or even to see Patch. On our way back to the marina, we did find <b>another gray whale</b> mid-way between the south end of Hat Island and the entrance to the jetty. He was feeding in about 20 feet of water. He surfaced a number of times, but never showed us his full fluke.

<br/>*<br/>
Here are photos of some of the <b>transient Orcas</b> about 20 minutes before they attacked Patch the <b>Gray whale</b>! Orcas were traveling North in 3 groups with the largest group about 5-7 including a very small/young Orca. T87 was hanging back with 1-2 smaller Orcas and the larger group was way ahead of him. I was on the Island Adventures tour. Our tour turned South to look for Grays away from the transients when we got a call that the attack was happening further north.

I was aboard the Mystic Sea and witnessed the <b>Orca attack</b> on the <b>gray</b>. My observation was that it was a planned attack and that the Orcas had no intention of eating the gray. It seemed more like a human-style gang "mugging" than any type of self preservation behavior.

<br/>*<br/>
About <b>6:15PM;</b> we noticed a stationary boat [NOAA?} out aways, at the entrance of <b>Penn Cove</b> [between Snakelum and Polnell Points]. As, we got closer, saw spouts. ORCAS, 2, THEN 3, THEN MORE. Counted <b>7 orcas</b> in all and it certainly seemed, they were feeding. Two females, would always come up together. Large male would always surface with another smaller orca by its side and were usually away/separate from the other 5 orcas. No breaching, but, several hard side rolling splashes. Along, with a few tail splashings. Watched for 30 minutes until <b>6:45PM</b>, then, it seemed like everyone/thing; knew party was over. At same time, as, NOAA and we were readying to leave, so were the orcas. On the move, headed toward, Naval base in Crescent Harbor. No sign of the Snakelum gray, as reported. But, then, again, was preoccupied with the activity of the orcas.

At <b>1.15pm</b> the Prince of Whales 'Ocean Magic' caught up with <b>T14 </b>, affectionately known as Pender. I just love seeing this big Transient Bull which seems to be on a regular basis through out the year. He was seen traveling slowly just off shore of Vancouver Island, around the <b>Sooke </b>area. He looked as though he was searching for prey but we never saw any behaviours that indicated he was consuming anything. We left him heading west. Apparently he had been seen the day before in the company of T87 and other Transients in USA waters. I guess, eventually he likes his own company, so wanders off !

I got a call early in the morning that there were Orcas over in <b>Rosario Strait</b>, near Bird Rocks. (Bird Rocks are a group of rocks in the middle of Rosario, a mile or so south of the ferry route. They often have sea lions hauled out and always seals.) We finally got there about <b>noon </b>to find <b>six transient Orcas</b> attacking a sea lion. They spent the whole day in the same spot. Lots of gulls feeding on the leftovers, with a resplendent Mt. Baker in the background. Today is gorgeous, and there were Orcas near Whidbey and west of Victoria, but no passengers, so I went fishing.

This morning we received a report of a <b>lone Male Orca</b> being sighted near <b>Constance Bank</b> at <b>8.30am</b>. By the time a boat caught up with the orca it had traveled west to Race Passage. Not long after the first boat arrived on scene it was confirmed the Orca was<b> T14 "Pender"</b>, who had last been seen yesterday in Rosario Strait. We continued to track T14's progress as he slowly made his way West throughout the day. By the time we headed out on Fastcat for a 2pm tour, Pender had traveled almost to <b>Sooke</b>. Just as we were nearing Sooke we discovered T14 had suddenly tracked south deeper into the Strait of Juan De Fuca and it was soon apparent why as we started to see multiple blows! We wondered at first if it was J-pod but it turned to be over <b>15 Transient Orcas</b> including the T100's) The Orcas were traveling close together at 8 kts towards Race Rocks. We finally left them just south of race Rocks still traveling East.

<br/>*<br/>
The afternoon tour today started out just to the Southwest of Secretary Island (just offshore of Sooke Harbour) with <b>T-14 (Pender)</b> on his own traveling West at about 5.5 kts. We followed 'The Big Guy' for over 35 minutes until we were almost in line with <b>Otter Pt</b>. For the entire time we were with Pender, he had been traveling in a straight line with very consistent surfacings, when suddenly, he did a hard left and increased his speed to over 9 kts. Based on this change in behaviour, I thought that maybe he was chasing his dinner or something.... However, it turned out that he was trying to catch up with a large group of Orcas (15-20 animals) which were Eastbound towards Race Rocks at a high rate of speed. Preliminary ID's included the T-100's with baby, T-30's, T-102, and possibly T-103 along with a few others that were not identified. Great job Val and Danny for spotting these animals way to the South of our location !!!! Nice work guys :) Once Pender caught up to this large group, all animals continued East towards Race Rocks. Our encounter ended at <b>1630 </b>hrs. 1nm West of <b>Race Rocks</b> Lighthouse.

Jill Hein of Coupeville called at <b>6:15 pm</b> to report the <b>Transient orcas</b> were off <b>Polnell Shores</b>, east of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island. She saw at least 6 of them, circling and tail slapping right off the NOAA boat!
<br/>*<br/>
Sarah Schmidt of <b>Coupeville</b>, Whidbey Island, called to report that while watching a <b>Gray whale</b> (#44 - see report below) off Snakelum Point, they spotted the <b>Transient orcas </b>at <b>5:05 pm</b> heading north in N. Saratoga Passage, going past the N. end of Camano Island, the NOAA boat still with them. Then at 5:08 pm the orcas had turned around, and headed back toward the entrance to <b>Penn Cove</b>, passing Polnell Pt. heading SW. By 5:20 pm, the orcas were off Maylor Pt, still heading toward Penn Cove, and Gray whale #44 was still feeding off Snakelum Point, just across the cove from the Transients. She called back at 6:20 pm - the Transients went almost into Oak Harbor, then were off Polnell Pt., about 1 mile away from the Gray whale off Snakelum Pt.

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called at around <b>1 pm</b> to report a pod of <b>~7 Transient orcas</b> in Saratoga Passage, mid-channel off <b>Langley</b>. The pod included the male T87. They were off Sandy Pt, and heading N/NW toward a Gray whale. He called back a bit later to report that <b>several of the female Transient orcas had rammed the Gray whale hard</b>, rolling it up out of the water and onto its back. It lay there awhile, then rolled over and was swimming again, but listing at a 10 - 15 degree angle. By <b>1:20 pm</b>, the Transients had left the gray whale and continued NW up Saratoga Passage, and the Gray whale had turned toward the beach at Langley.
Passengers on the boat shot some photos and video, which will be broadcast on KING 5 TV News tonight.

About <b>1 PM</b> today, I was watching a whale watch boat just a little north of <b>Langley</b>, I think it was the Mystic Sea. I was watching through the binocs as they were quite close to a spouting <b>gray</b>. All of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving fast. I thought is was a power boat, but then I twice thought I saw a tall, male orca fin roll twice, then it was gone. I wasn't sure what I had seen, and was hoping the Mystic Sea would report on the encounter. Sounds like it may have been the encounter you just mentioned.

Veronica von Allworden of Langley called - she had just taken a flight over Saratoga Passage, and saw <b>3 Gray whales</b> at <b>1 pm</b> off <b>East Pt</b>, near the entrance to Holmes Harbor, actively feeding. She also saw <b>Patch </b> between <b>Langley </b>and Bells Beach, in shallow water by a B&amp;B on Saratoga Rd, near where the Mystic sea reported the gray whale that had been attacked by the Transient orcas had last been seen. Patch was surfacing to breathe, but not feeding. When she flew by again 15 minutes later he was gone. 
Later, she wrote: We found Patch (49) in shallow water half way between Langley and Bells Beach at about <b>12:50 pm</b>. He was not feeding just laying on the bottom and then coming up for a breath. Fifteen minutes later he was no longer there. I hope that is a sign that he is going to be alright! At 1:10 we circled 2 aggressively feeding <b>gray whales</b> in the shallows off of <b>Fox Spit</b>. They had headed off by 1:20. We did not see which way they went.

I was on a Deception Pass tour boat out of <b>Cornet Bay</b>, Whidbey Island. Three other tour boats were also watching the <b>orcas </b>so this may be a redundant report. There were approximately <b>four-six orcas</b>, seen at <b>1:30 pm</b>, apparently feeding, the tour boat operator thought on a sea lion killed earlier. The male has a chunk missing near the top of his dorsal fin (that would be T87). The tour boat operator said they were <b>transients</b>.

This afternoon from about <b>1:15-2:00</b> we had about <b>six transients</b> feeding on a Steller sea lion half a mile south of Bird Rocks in <b>Rosario Strait</b>. Included in the group were <b>T87 and T88</b>, and they were all doing lots of circling with the sea lion (or remnants thereof) visible at the surface or in the mouths of the whales on several occasions. Many gulls were following the whales and taking advantage of feeding on scraps near the surface. In addition to the large male T87, there was another male by himself quite a ways off that I heard was later identified as <b>T14</b>. The setting was perfect, with the whales surfacing in front of Mt. Baker in the background.

I was on Capt. Jim Maya's boat on Saturday <b>afternoon </b>to see the transients who had been at Bird Rocks in <b>Rosario Strait</b> most of the morning. As we arrived Pender T-14 had left the group and was heading off by himself. The whales were feeding on a Steller sea lion and were in the same location. My photos revealed that there were <b>7 transients</b> in the group. I have sent the pictures to the Center for Whale Research for verification. In the meantime this is who I believe I saw. <b>T87, T88, T90, T90B, T124, T124D and T124E</b> (ID's confirmed by CWR). I posted some images on my blog from the day.

I live on Whidbey Island overlooking the S<b>aratoga Passage north of Langley</b>, just south of Bells Beach. This morning at <b>8:15 am</b> I was using binoculars to look for grays. Instead about a half-mile out from the bluff I saw 2 or 3 animals heading north in the passage. They were swimming directly north, not stopping or deviating from their line. All I could see was intermittent surfacing dorsal fins sliding through the water. There were at least 2 going side by side and appearing one after another, but I think there were actually 3 of them. I was only able to track them visually for a couple hundred yards before I lost sight of them. If I had to guess I would say they were <b>orcas </b>because of the formation and way they were swimming, and the dorsal fins. Approximate Lat/Long values where I first saw them: 48.06006, -122.44345 Thanks,

I saw <b>a Grey Whale</b> in <b>Crescent Harbor</b> (near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) again today at about <b>3:20 PM</b>. He was feeding and QUITE close to shore. My girls and I walked down on the beach and got to see a fin and his tail come up out of the water many times. We actually meandered down the beach with him for a few minutes. The folks who pointed the whale out to us indicated that they had seen him yesterday as well. And on a walk down to the beach on Monday afternoon I saw a whale spout several times. It seems as though one may be returning each day to feed or kind of 'camped out' down there.

At about <b>2:45pm</b> we saw a spout just off the beach at <b>Cama Beach</b> on Camano Island. We saw it again a few times, it was heading north. The last time we saw it we could just make out the flukes as it headed down. Probably <b>a grey whale</b>, but we were too far off to see for sure.

Jim Somers called Orca Network from the <b>Whidbey Naval Air Station Exchange</b> Lot where he was in his car watching <b>a gray whale</b> rolling in shallow water about 50 feet from shore.
<br/>*<br/>
A whale was sighted around <b>3 pm</b>, heading west, in <b>Penn Cove</b>, on Whidbey Island. It may have been <b>a gray whale</b>, and was definitely not an orca. The cove was extremely choppy, due to high winds, but the whale was easy to see, because of its size. It was a lone whale, fairly close to the shore, swimming against the current, heading west, until it apparently reached the end of the cove. We then observed it heading east, back out of Penn Cove.

Today, about <b>12:15 PM</b>, <b>a gray whale</b> was in front of <b>Beverly Beach</b>, Whidbey Island, circled the bay area, and after about a half hour started heading North towards Baby Island.

Mark Malleson and I did a survey of <b>Monterey Bay CA</b> today and found <b>600+ pacific white-sided dolphins</b> just south of Monterey Bay around <b>0900</b>. About three hours later we covered the same area and found <b>three transient killer whales</b>. These turned out to be <b>CA138 </b>(confirmed by Nancy Black) and her juvenile <b>CA138A </b>and a brand new calf (<b>CA138B</b>). The whales had just made a kill and milled in the same area for about an hour before they ditched us in deteriorating weather conditions. We're not sure whether they killed a pinniped or small cetacean. We ended the encounter at1255.

More on the <b>T's</b> in <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>: Heavy seas and rain made todays 1:00 trip a little challenging as we could not locate the <b>4 Transients</b> that Radar found this morning a few miles Southeast of Race Rocks. Brett and I spent close to 2.5 hours searching the area with 4 other boats with no success. Things changed for the better at <b>1530 </b>hrs., when Russ Nicks from Sooke Coastal Explorations stumbled across the <b>T-30's</b>, 0.5 nm Southwest of the <b>Bedford Islands (Becher Bay)</b>. The four transients had just captured a large Sea Lion and were staying in the same area for over 45 minutes as they were having a late afternoon snack !!! As the animals circled around, we could see a large oil slick forming on the surface of the water and the gulls were gathering to pick up the scraps that were left behind. The T-30's have been hanging out in this area for a few days now, as they were seen the same day that the juvenile Gray Whale washed up at East Sooke Park. Our encounter ended at 1630 hrs., just 1.3 nm to the Southeast of the area where the dead Gray Whale was located (Aylard Farm).

Mary Bond of Seattle saw a whale that sounds like <b>a gray whale</b> from her description, at Meadow Point, N end of Golden Gardens Park in <b>Seattle</b>, <b>2:30-3:00 pm</b>. She said it was rolling around in the shallows on it's back, and it had a clear dorsal ridge and flipper marks. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Jeff Lamarche of Eagle Wing Tours called in a sighting of the <b>T30's</b> taking a sea lion a half mile SW of Bedford Islands, near<b> Beecher Bay</b>, at <b>3:30</b> today.
<br/>*<br/>
I snapped these photos today near the <b>southern tip of Camano</b>; just below our bank, I saw a fin come up out of the water, and lots of bubbling. I rushed for the camera, and snapped a couple more; looking at the first one, blowing it up, it almost <b>looks like an orca tussling with a grey</b>. The second two pics are obviously a grey, swimming away to the west-northwest towards Pebble Beach. There were two greys total. I read previous reports of an orca to the south of us swimming with greys, and I'm wondering if this is also one. If it was, we did not see it follow the two greys. Once the greys traveled NW from our home at the south end of Camano, we drove to <b>Pebble Beach</b> to watch them continue up Saratoga passage. The two greys came very close to the beach. Once they had traveled up towards Mabana, <b>a third whale followed,</b> feeding with a seal following it along. They were at Pebble at <b>10:00 am.</b>
<br/>Peg Boley, Camano Island
<br/><i>The consensus is that the markings on the Photo of the Day are on a gray whale. -hg</i>

I saw at least two <b>[gray] whales</b> spouting in the <b>Saratoga Passage, Bells Beach</b>, about <b>2:50</b> this afternoon. They swirled about and spouted several times. My guess is that they were feeding. Only saw a miniscule part of one of their spines. I believe they were headed south.

I saw a single <b>Gray whale</b> 1/2 mile west of the<b> Keyport Naval</b> Base at <b>1015</b>. The whale was heading South between Bainbridge Island and the Kitsap Peninsula towards Brownsville. It's probably close to the Brownsville marina by this point.

Spotted maybe <b>a small grey</b> feeding off the green buoy at golden gardens park in <b>Seattle </b>this morning about <b>10am</b>. A few spouts and rising slightly above the surface every few minutes, staying in that area.

Jim Winship called in a report at <b>9 AM</b> of a <b>gray whale</b> at the entrance to <b>Oak Harbor Bay on Whidbey Island</b>, feeding in mudflats.
<br/>*<br/>
Pam Allen called Orca Network to report <b>a gray whale</b> moving back and forth near <b>Similk Bay</b>, north end of Skagit Bay, north of Whidbey Island.
<br/>*<br/>
My wife and I are new residents of <b>Poulsbo</b>. This morning from roughly <b>6:45am to 7:30</b> we saw about six spouts in Liberty Bay and the profile of a surfaced <b>[gray] whale</b> in the far distance. Too far to identify but the Kitsap newspaper says there have been gray whale sightings in the Bay over the past four days. I assume it's the same critter(s).

<b>0930 Bells Beach (NE of Langley) One gray</b> slowly moving toward Langley, close to shore, feeding on and off. I thought his head either had beige-pink spots or barnacles when he surfaced close to my viewing, but he was back down fast, so not positive.
<br/>Peggy Sullivan 
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan called at <b>5:30</b> to report <b>orcas </b>just off Fort Ward, SE tip of <b>Bainbridge Island</b>. Jeff counted <b>7</b>, including one sparky little one that was acting up a lot.
<br/>*<br/>
WA State Ferries called with a report of about <b>six orcas</b> seen at <b>4:40 pm </b>from the <b>Fauntleroy ferry</b>, headed north in the northbound shipping lane.
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>1500 </b>near the VH buoy South of <b>Victoria</b>, Strait of Juan de Fuca, <b>5T'S</b> going more or less South West. Strong winds and 2+ meter seas made for poor viewing but it appeared to be <b>T103 and the T49's</b>. Last seen nearing Race Rocks heading S.W. <b>1620</b>.

The <b>Gray whale</b> activity has been amazing this morning! <b>NW of Langley</b> a gray whale (looked like #531) was feeding in the shallow water at about <b>7:30 AM</b>. At about 8:15 it was in front of downtown Langley when another gray whale (#49) came from the NW and was feeding just west of our house (NW of Langley). #531 stopped feeding and swam very fast toward #49. #49 stopped feeding and started to swim fast toward #531! It looked like they were going to ram each other. When they were about 15-20 feet away from each other both of them rolled and started feeding side by side! It was very interesting to watch! Both whales continued to feed and headed off to the NW. <b>10:00 AM</b>. #531 just came by <b>NW of Langley</b>, feeding and by itself, heading to downtown Langley onto the southeast along Whidbey. I have great ID pics of both whales and will be sending them along.
At <b>11:45</b>, gray whale "Patch" #49, returned to feed in the shallow water NW of Langley. Its <b>12:00</b> now and the whale has turned to the NW and is in deeper water headed in your direction (Greenbank).
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley
<br/>*<br/>
Likely you heard from ace whale-spotter, our neighbor Veronica Von Allworden, about the appearance of <b>[gray] whales</b> feeding off upper 1st St on the west end of <b>Langley</b>, beginning about <b>7:40a</b>. Well, I watched <b>ANOTHER pair</b> (or the same pair returned?) beginning 8:15a until about 8:35a feeding in the same area - the bottom of my yard! One large with powerful blows, and a smaller (juvenile?) whose blows were much less powerful. They were very close to shore, and circled unhurriedly whilst feeding. Lost of shore birds picking off the floaters. In between both these appearances Langley's whale bell rang resoundingly!

<br/>*<br/>
I saw what looked like a <b>Gray Whale</b> off of <b>Keyport, Washington</b> this evening at about <b>5:00 p.m</b>. It was traveling south out of Liberty Bay toward Bremerton. It surfaced near the point of land that marks the northwest entrance to Agate Passage. There were several of us watching it and one of the ladies said that she saw two whale spouts but I only saw the one. It appeared to be a Gray, as it did not have much of a dorsal fin and no white markings on the tail fluke. It was traveling near the surface for about 5 minutes, blew twice and then submerged. It was mottled gray in color with what appeared to be growths on its back near the tail, so I'll assume those were some barnacle deposits.

Amy Carey called Orca Network about a <b>"big whale"</b> reported in <b>Quartermaster Harbor</b>, between Vashon Island and Maury Island, around mid-day today.
<br/>*<br/>
You probably know all about this <b>dead Gray Whale</b> already. If you haven't heard here is a picture taken this afternoon at 2.30pm from the Prince of Whales, Ocean Magic vessel out of Victoria. It had washed up on the rocks at <b>Beecher Bay, East Sooke</b>, Vancouver Island. No doubt due to the very stormy w/e here. It doesn't look very big so no doubt a young one.

<b>Four Transients</b> were sighted just offshore of <b>Sooke Harbour</b> today at approx. <b>11:30am</b>. Brett, Danny and I spent almost 4 hours out there pounding through huge seas on ''Goldwing' but only came up with seeing a<b> dead juvenile Gray Whale</b> on the beach in Becher Bay (East Sooke Park). The animal looked very similar to the curious little Gray we had a few days ago in Enterprise Channel. Poor little guy.

Just after <b>6PM </b>2 hours before 11.4' high tide, another <b>gray </b>visit. Right, in front of dining room window; while my folks and I were eating dinner, a gray came rolling by. Really close in, with a good look at its large mauve/gray color back. Along, with splashes of white. Then, 30 seconds later, a feeding stop; only, 50 feet or less, out from shoreline. After, a 10 minute snack, a trail of spouts, headed N.E. towards <b>Strawberry Pt.</b> With, yesterday's short pass by, along with this evening; makes 9 out of 10 days, since March 23rd, we have seen this same? single gray.
