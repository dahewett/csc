<b>Onyx (L87)</b> was a rockstar today! He breached many times as he passed<b> East Point, Saturna Island, BC</b> with members of <b>J-pod (group A) and the K14s</b>. It was nothing short of an amazing day! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30 pm - Lots of calls on Lime Kiln</b>! -Angela Barrat

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:17 pm - Orcas approaching Lime Kiln</b>! -Cayley Coulbourn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:21 pm -</b> sweet and loud <b>vocals of Js and Ks</b>.
<br/><b>7:11 pm- </b>our orca friends are near the hydrophone... <b>echolocation on Lime Kiln</b>. -Alisa, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Onyx (L87) at East Point</b>, Saturna Island with members of <b>J-pod (group A) and the K14s</b>. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Hey Guys! We were out today with<b> Group A of Jpod (without the J16's) along with the K14's</b> as they made their way towards E<b>ast Point (Saturna Island, BC)</b>. <b>J49, T'ilem I'nges</b> just couldn't stop breaching out of the water!! Then everyone got in on the action. -Cheers, Ashley Keegan, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Gorgeous day today! Winds have been a real pain for us this month but today gave us a little lull in the big northwesterlies to get out there to enjoy <b>group A of J pod and the K14's</b>. They were heading for East Point but took their time getting there fighting a 7 knot current near Boiling Reef! -Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Lobo, K26</b>...One of many, many breaches today along the south shore of <b>Saturna Island, BC</b>! -James Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

June 30 We saw<b> four [Bigg's/Transient] orcas</b> where we hang out at the beach at <b>Cormorant Pass </b>(between Steilacoom and Ketron Island, Puget Sound). We have been at this spot for 30 years and never have seen them this early in the season. -Cindy Prusso 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Minke whale "Nick Jagger"</b> came cruising past us while we were listening for killer whales in the fog at <b>False Bay</b> in the morning. -Mark Malleson 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

As we headed west in Spieden Channel we got the word---there were whales up ahead! Behind those two came the towering fin of <b>Lobo (K26)</b>, which told me we had members of both the <b>J14s and the K14</b>s...As we followed the whales we realized they were heading somewhere they don't normally go---they were pointed right for the <b>topside of Spieden Island </b>where they got serious about foraging. CWR (Center for Whale Research) says they haven't been seen in that spot for over 15 years!...We left them still on the north side of Speiden and later I heard they continued north towards East Point through Boundary Pass. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw behavior from member's of <b>J Pod's Group A and the K14's </b>that has never been witnessed by researches before! The Southern Resident's went through the <b>Cactus Islands</b>! It's been seven years since researchers have seen them on the east side of Spieden Island, but they've never actually seen them go through the Cactus Islands. It was very interesting indeed. After they passed through, <b>J2 seemed to circle the J14's, J19's, and K14's</b> back around to forage some. They formed a lineup and seemed to be foraging as the North Atlantic whales would! It was incredible. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Residents busy doing the <b>west side shuffle</b>. Spotted them at <b>San Juan County park </b>mid channel heading south around <b>4pm</b>. Were still mid channel going south <b>past Lime Kiln slowly around 4:30</b> then did a close pass by porpoising past Westside Landbank around 5pm. Baby in tow. Currently approaching <b>Grandmas Cove very spread out at 6:38pm</b>. -Ariel Yseth

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:43 pm -</b> I'm hearing a lot of <b>calls on the hydrophones. Lime kiln</b>. -Lore Borras

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Been hearing quite a bit of <b>vocalizing on OrcaSound hydrophone</b> this morning since about <b>1:45am</b> (PDT). -Cydnie Simons

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:16 pm -</b>  Its been  long time since I had a report but we just had <b>two minke whales at Hannah Heights</b>- they came south and turned north again. Rather close to the shore- nice to see them around! -Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island  

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>12:30 pm - </b>Just reporting a sighting at Pender Island, Thieves Bay. There were 2 main groups (9-10 orcas) with babies heading north along the shore. Just traveling.
Scott Pickwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J42 Echo breaches just off East Point</b> on Saturna Island, BC. -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J2 (Granny) and her granddaughter J14 (Samish) in the lead this morning at 9:15 </b>at the Center for Whale Research, heading north a mile <b>north of Lime Kiln park</b>. They were spread out for miles. The J<b>16s didn't pass Lime Kiln until 10:30</b>. -Howard/ON (See the Center's full report Encounter #57)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We've had a week of amazing mornings on the water and today was no exception. We met up with <b>J-Pod Group A and the K12s, K13s, and K14s at Pile Point</b> heading north at 8:30 AM. They were very spread out; by the time we left them at 11 AM the leaders were well north of Kellett Bluff and the trailers were off San Juan County Park. -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute, San Juan Island, WA

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found those amazing <b>T075s</b> today - here's a photo of T075B with calves T075B2 (left, born in April) and T036A3 in back. <b>Between Waldron Island and Doughty Point, Orcas Island</b>. Lots of breaching, and they had seal for lunch. -Jill Hein, <i>ID by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research </i>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
It's been a crazy few day's lately! On Sunday we saw the <b>T075B's</b> play with a harbor seal, carry it around, but not eat it! These Orcas have been notorious lately for playing with their harbor seal prey. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I spotted a group of<b> three orcas in the San Juan Channel</b> near Mineral Point around <b>11am</b> traveling north <b>toward Waldron</b>. Looked like a male female and calf but I could not id them. I would be curious to hear if anyone else living on the channel saw them and was able to id them. They were in no great hurry and seemed to be finding food but they were also spyhopping quite a bit. -William Radcliffe

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

This evening from <b>5:45 - 6:45 PM</b> I watched as <b>Js and Ks went south past Lime Kiln</b>. Present were the K13s, K14s, K12s, J19s, and J16s in that order, with the J2s/J14s offshore towards the end. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Big spyhop from <b>K33 Tika this evening off Lime Kiln Lighthouse State Park</b>, San Juan Island. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:30 pm - </b>While on the road along the <b>west side of San Juan Island at the West Side Preserve we saw orcas</b> out a half mile or so moving generally southeast. Upon disembarking the car and scrambling down the hill I applied binocs to eyes and was able to tentatively ID <b>J16 and her baby J50</b>, which made sense since they had been seen earlier that day a few miles north. Other orcas were seen fanned out across Haro Strait in various modes of traveling and splashing. -Howard/ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:43 pm - I hear them now! Lime Kiln</b>. -Susan Wickland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:05 pm - Loud echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>.
<br/><b>5:25 pm - echolocation and calls, sounds like some Ks on OS</b>
<br/><b>5:15 pm - start hearing SRKWs on OrcaSound hydrophone</b>. -Alisa LB/ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:30 pm - </b>Maia of WA State Ferries reported <b>6 orcas headed south in Haro Strait</b> near Mandarte Island.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Four-year-old <b>K44 Ripple (L) with mom K27 Deadhead in Boundary Pass</b>. -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:00 am -</b> ...What a sight to see! I was on tour with Sooke Coastal Explorations. <b>All of J pod &amp; some L pod</b>. Heading West! Spanned out from Vancouver Island and <b>across the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. -Deanna Brett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>8 AM</b> this morning we picked up the <b>K12s and K13s</b> heading north just north of <b>Pile Point</b>. (While it sounded like more whales than this were headed "in" last night, I believe the others were westbound out the strait again.) Over the next 2+ hours we followed them slowly north, leaving them at <b>Kellett Bluff still going north at 10:45 AM</b>. For the most part they were spread out and in slow travel mode, with occasional stops to forage. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:36 am - Echolocation &amp; faint calls on Lime Kiln</b>. -Jill Clogston

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:13 am - Tune into Lime Kiln</b> now! Great vocals! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:12 am - Hearing vocals on Lime Kiln</b>. -Casey Fitzgerald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:41 am - </b>sounds like <b>J Pod on Lime Kiln</b> hydrophone. -Connie Bicketon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

WARNING: June 27th PREDATION EVENT PHOTOS  (and ID NOTES)
<br/>The next part of this section includes many photos submitted by several people of a female carrying around a Harbor seal she had killed. It is not bloody but we understand is upsetting to some people and out of respect wanted to give notice.
<br/>There was some confusion circulated about IDs and which pods/individuals were present, here are ID notes by Melisa Pinnow (Naturalist and volunteer with Center for Whale Research): "<b>T077A </b>is a loner male and hangs out with other matrilines instead of his family. I think people assumed it was the T077s because of T077A but really it was the <b>T075Bs and T036As</b>. That spy hop there with the freckles on her chin is <b>T036A</b>. The female with the seal in her mouth that has the eye patch with freckle like dots at the left end side is <b>T075C</b>, who is not the mom of anybody."
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:20 pm -</b> <b>One orca </b>being followed by boats on <b>north side of Lopez island</b>, across from Orcas island. Does anyone know which one it is? -Forest Chick

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:15-5:30pm - Between Shaw and Orcas Islands</b>. 
I saw her (<b>T75C</b> ID by Melisa Pinnow) come up four different times w/this seal.  Lots of spy hops, tail lobs... -Cathy Miller Scott, June 27, 2015

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We had a very memorable encounter with transient orcas near Shaw Island in the afternoon on the Island Explorer 3.  <b>T75B, T75C</b>, and two family calves chased and caught a harbor seal while <b>T77A</b> swam about a quarter mile away.  The orcas played with the seal by throwing it around like a rag doll at times and spyhopping with it in their mouths over and over again.  It was an experience we will never forget! -Bart Rulon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

...An incredible whale-watching excursion (w/Outer Island Expeditions) I went on in the San Juan Islands of Washington state! ...We watched and gently followed this <b>pod of transient Orca whales  between Lopez and Orcas Islands</b> in the San Juan islands...there were <b>about seven whales</b>, plus a very large male (<b>T77A</b>) in the distance...The portion of the pod we were following were the adult females with their calves...We saw them play with each other: tail slaps, jumps, spy hoping, belly rolls, back flips, so incredible! As a nature photographer its very rare to witness wildlife acting like this, and I will never forget what an incredible experience we all had on the water on this day! -Jim Stiles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T75C</b> with a harbor seal she had just killed near <b>Lopez Island ferry terminal</b>. Members of the <b>T36As and T75Bs</b> were cruising inshore along <b>Blakely Island</b> in a beautiful, peaceful prelude to an incredibly intense predation event we were to witness a few minutes later. -James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T075B with her calf T075B2</b>, born in April of 2015. -Melisa Pinnow, Naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had <b>at least 5 humpbacks in the waters north and east of Race Rocks</b>, (MMY0006 'Windy' (left) and BCX1068 'Split Fluke' (right) swim in tandem past
Race Rocks) and then <b>Big Mama out by Beecher Bay</b>. MM20004 (ID by Boat Naturalist) -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 26</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>9:00pm - Orcas just passed Point Roberts</b>. Approximately 10 whales heading north and moving quickly. Some breaching, charging, and feeding behaviour. At least two large males and one calf. So exciting! -Sandra Scott

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Evening </b>of June 26th we saw a number of <b>Orcas </b>heading north in front of <b>Lighthouse Park in Point Roberts</b>. -Ronald Hansen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K &amp; L Pod</b> at sunset, here, at <b>Lime Kiln</b>. Mmmmm...mighty fine. -James Taylor

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:50 pm - </b>the chatter is starting up again - really fun conversation! -Susan Berta, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:23 pm - </b>I was about to give up as I didn't hear anything for a while except boat noise but now <b>they're back and lovely</b>! -Debbie Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:10 pm - </b>Hearing great <b>calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> - Southern Resident orcas off west San Juan Island! -Susan Berta/ ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We headed off to the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> again today, where members of <b>J-pod </b>were spread along the coast line for several miles, from <b>False Bay to Battleship Island</b>! Almost a carbon copy of Thursday's report. We saw some breaching close to shore - a lot of foraging - and <b>J-2 Granny</b>, matriarch of J-pod - gave us a close pass by. A few harbor seals checked us out as we headed back to port, another incredible day in the Salish Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:10 pm - </b>hearing a variety of <b>vocalizations, S4 calls and sounds like some typical Ls</b> calls in there too.
<br/><b>7:48 pm -</b> hearing e<b>cholocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. Love the sounds of SRKWs. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 am  - </b>A group of at least <b>10-12 orcas </b>were seen in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. Tail slaps, pec waves, and one breach. Adult males present.  Viewed from the Victoria Clipper. -Lauren Ryan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:11 pm - Minke</b> headed north towards<b> Lime Kiln on SJI west side</b> just now. -Mary Ann Rice 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 25</font></b></center>
<br/>

Another beautiful sunny day with the lovely <b>J-16 resident orca group</b> and others, around <b>Andrews Bay north of Lime Kiln state park</b>. Some great close passes by big Blackberry, J-27, the J-16 group, J-16 Slick, J-36 Alki, and two of the calves,and most likely the rest of the that family group, plus J-19 Shachi and J-31 Tsuchi. Some big breaches, a spyhop, and some intense porpoising and fishing behaviors. Great encounter, with a few bald eagles for good measure! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 
 
Being a mom isn't easy, and it must be a little extra tough when you're a first time mom as in the case of <b>J36 "Alki". Her little boy, J52</b> seems to be quite the curious little guy and lately I've seen him do all sorts of strong willed behaviors and actively watch mom correct or guide him in another way. He also has some rake marks now, not sure when these happened but it's the first I recall seeing them. These are likely marks from play or even mom making a corrective statement to kiddo. There is so much to learn for a new Killer whale calf, and their mothers are essential to that learning process. J52 spyhopped several times to check us out before mom came by and guided him back to where she was fishing. Beautiful encounter with wonderful evening light! -Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J50 tail slaps beside her mother, Slick J16</b>. - Melisa Pinnow 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:32 pm - </b>Hi all, <b>Calls and echolocation on OrcaSound</b> right now. -Lori Robinson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Echolocation on LK, starting at 11:22...and again at 12:17</b>. -Gayle Swigart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:15 am - Orcas heading north on SJI west side</b> just past Edwards Point, moving slowly. -Mary Ann Rice

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

We continue to have amazing whale encounters almost every day. Even better, the pod associations are constantly changing so we're getting lots of opportunities to make hydrophone recordings of unique groups of whales. (One thing Michael is hoping to look at for his thesis is how call types change with different social associations.) This morning, however, we had one of more most magical encounters yet. We were off the <b>south end of San Juan Island with members of J and K Pods.</b> We were the only boat with the whales in glassy calm waters when they started breaching - 10 breaches in a row by different whales!  Photo 300mm zoom and about 100-150 yards, decently cropped here. We were shut down making a hydrophone recording when they started going off breaching. Most whales were about 200-250 yards off but<b> K26 Lobo</b>, the whale shown here, came a bit closer. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were the only two boats with the <b>J14s and J16s through Active Pass </b>yesterday, and as usual, they really ramped up the action in there. It seemed the babies needed some help through some of the currents, but the orcas all went nuts playing around in and surfing the wake of ferries and yachts, rolling, breaching, propoising - just having a great time. -Andy Scheffler

I spent the day on San Juan Island and had some fabulous orca sightings. After arriving at <b>Lime Kiln in early afternoon</b>, several<b> Southern Residents</b> traveled by between approximately<b> 2 and 3PM </b>and were spread out. The last group that I saw was the<b> K-7s (K13s)</b>  with the fabulous<b> K-44 Ripple</b> (one of my personal favorites). Many people enjoyed the passing from the rocks and also several kayakers watched from the near shore kelp beds. Later in the day I went out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching and we encountered the <b>L-4s, L-47s and L-95</b>. They were in a resting line <b>heading north on the west side of SJI</b>. When they got to the north end, one of the lead whales spyhopped at which time all in the group promptly did an about face. They stayed nearly stationary for a very long time doing dozens of spy hops, rolling, tail slapping, and playing in the kelp. The spy hops were a little unusual in that the whales were staying above the water for very long looks. They eventually broke up into two groups moving back south down Haro Strait. One group stayed closer to SJI and the other group west in Canada. Several made their way down to Kelp Reef and did more spy hops and tail slaps. We watched this behavior under beautiful skies and soft light while a great blue heron contemplated his evening meal perched on a kelp bed. The waters were calm and the air was still with backlit blows hanging in the air like a spider web on a dewy morning. Both groups joined back up and gave indications they were possibly headed back out to open sea. It was a magical day. -Debbie Stewart

Some encounters are so very special, and get ingrained in your memories that even if you pass a certain location over and over again, those memories come back. I think whenever I see the Whidbey island bluffs, I will see this little girl playing and breaching on a sunny calm day. What a treat. This is lovely little girl <b>J50, Mom is Slick J16</b>. I particularly think this female calf holds so much hope. We need more females to continue breeding to help bolster the population. So when I see her, I can't help but he hopeful she will help bring a brighter future for the Southern Resident Killer whales. -Traci Walter

<b>2:30 pm - From Biz Point (Rosario Strait, Anacortes) </b>Maybe  <b>6-7 orca including 2 large males and a few smaller ones</b>, with one much smaller than the rest.

Man, I just can't get enough of the<b> J16's</b>. The orcas made a big circle out on the banks then headed straight <b>back for San Juan Island</b>, trending north up the island. And who did we find at the north end of San Juan? None other than the group that headed north last night that had already come back down south. They must have heard each other in the large acoustical corridor and wanted to join up (which I saw on my evening trip)! It was a blustery day out there, but it was nice to see the orcas socializing.

The large whale breached clear of the water on at least two occasions and there was also tail slapping and head bobbing behavior. We believe a cruise ship altered it's north bound course to better view these whales. The whales were close to shore and headed north. Lots of other people saw them. -Robert Gray

On Friday we saw the <b>T065A's who were still traveling with the T077's down Rosario Strait</b>. They were being very sporadic, zig-zagging as they hunted for marine mammals cooperatively in the straits. The T065A's are the "social butterflies" of the Transient orca community. It's so interesting to see who they've team up with day to day! It was also nice to see the T077's since I haven't seen them much! -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Another fantastic encounter with the <b>T65As this afternoon</b>. This fun little family group rarely disappoints. They are always up to some kind of antics. When we first arrived on scene with them, they were heavily harassing a harbor seal with the help of another family group, the T77s. They could have easily eaten the seal at any moment, but instead decided to play with their food - not unlike a cat with a mouse. It may seem cruel and it can be hard to watch these sorts of interactions, but it is necessary for the younger whales to learn hunting skills and techniques. After they were finished with the seal, all kinds of other above-surface antics commenced. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Quintessential Pacific Northwestern days to watch the <b>T065A's and the T077's near Maple Bay, BC</b> northwestern Salt Spring Island. It was uncharted waters for Captain Spencer and I, but it sure was worth the extra time. Just the scenery alone would have been worth it for me! The rock formations that were shaped by the British Columbian continental ice shelf, and the thickly lined Douglas fir forests that shadowed us the entire way north were beautiful! When we got on scene the <b>mammal-hunting Transients had already made a kill </b>and were working on prey sharing the kill. Then they continued south and made another kill, engaging in lot's of social activity! As if that wasn't enough adventure for us, we also went back out on a second trip in the rain and mist to watch a lone Transient, <b>T049C traveling north just south of Sidney, BC.</b> -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
A couple of beautiful days with the <b>T65A's and T77's</b>. We had them around <b>Crofton </b>today and they were moving very slowly and taking down seals every chance they got. It was pretty incredible. -Gary Sutton

Tonight we had the most amazing encounter with the <b>J16's</b> traveling south through <b>Boundary Pass</b>. However, it's no surprise that the one claiming all the attention was none other than little six-month old <b>J50</b>.

Around <b>8 PM </b>we watched a group of transients head north in San Juan Channel from Reuben Tarte county park. It turned out to be the <b>T65As and the T77s</b>. They turned into <b>Spieden Channel</b> and from a friend's house we watched them milling around right off the rocks for almost an hour. They nailed one, probably two, harbor seals in that time. Just as it was getting dark around 10 PM they finally decided to move on, heading northeast out of Spieden Channel. Since it was too dark for photos, I took video instead, and I'm glad I did, because I think it captured the essence of the encounter even better! As if orcas close to shore aren't enough, the background landscape and sunset were the icing on the cake. -Monika Wieland

About 8:00pm they were hugging the north shore and it looked like they found the Harbor porpoise, then I lost them again.  At 8:12 they appear to be heading east and north. Perfect conditions.

<b>5pm - </b>Fred Michelson called in a report of <b>2-3 orcas mid-channel traveling west between the south tip of Anderson Island and the Nisqually delta</b>. He said they have been covering the same route almost every afternoon since June 6. He says one male has a distinctive dorsal fin. He writes: "2-3 orcas were in front of our home during late afternoon June 6 and 7 swimming in mid channel between Anderson Island and south shore of the Nisqually reach moving east to west. Watched them for about 30 minutes till they went out of sight to the west heading toward Johnsons Point. The same occurred the next day June 7. Another sighting was made on late morning of June 8 off the southeast tip of Anderson Island and they moved toward the DuPont shoreline and toward the Nisqually Delta but didn't see them again."

<b>8:40 am -</b> We believe these are the same whales I reported today from the weekend and this week which I reported earlier today. Now they came again today (it appears 2 and I am thinking one is young) but not a new born. They seem transient because no pod is seen. They are on the same course and same exact spot and heading the same direction. It is as if they like the chances of catching prey so the cycle that brings them back here everyday is productive. It is in the Nisqually Reach from the outer Delta of the Nisqually River Delta traveling east to west past the south shore of Anderson Island toward Johnsons Point or Devils Head. We lost sight of them as they moving westerly about 2-3 miles from where we live on 52d Lane NE Olympia Wa. -Fred Michelson

There were some <b>orcas just off County Park</b> (San Juan Island) about +/- 2 Pm. Super pod of J's &amp; L's? -Peggy Strickland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1 pm - </b>got a call from the WA State Ferries of about <b>6-8 orcas heading west in Spieden Channel</b>, just north of Roche Harbor.

Saw <b>a lone dolphin</b> while kayaking at Dick Gilmore park, <b>Tacoma/Browns point area</b> around <b>8 pm</b> tonight. Very close to the shore. Wasn't very active. Maybe lost/sick. (There have been several sightings of two, and now a lone <b>Pacific White-sided dolphin</b> in the south Puget Sound for about a year). -Tim Larson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:39 - </b>Headed back north. But still south of <b>Kingston</b>. I couldn't even begin to tell you who it was but there was probably <b>at least 10-15</b>. I lost them after they turned north.
<b>8:23 - Kingston - Edmonds Ferry riders... Orcas</b> are on your right! Looks like they're just milling around. Just south of the ferry lane. -Laura Finch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:28 pm - Pod of at least 6 </b>individuals heading generally south off of <b>Jefferson Point in Kingston</b>.  Going forward, then sometimes heading back close to other individuals.  Maybe cruising (or feeding?) -Teri Munter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:23 pm - </b>Just saw <b>a pod of 4+ orcas while on the port Townsend ferry</b>...Looked like they were headed west, maybe slightly northwest. -Jason Weigner

L's came back in today! Just a quick clip of the<b> L55's off Edwards Point</b> on San Juan Island. We had the <b>L4's, L47's and L95 on the west side of San Juan Island</b>. Encounter #40 Video by Center for Whale Research

7<b>:52 pm - </b>still hearing them and getting louder
<br/><b>7:33 pm - </b>Hearing some clicks and a couple <b>calls on Lime Kiln Hydro</b>! -Nicole Soulodre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Great day (and even better evening) spent with the <b>L4's, L47's, and L95 Nigel</b>! They were very social tonight, as opposed to this afternoon where they were very serious about foraging. It was lovely to see them socializing before sunset. So grateful to have seen some of L Pod today, it's been a while. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:38 pm - Off Pile Pt and Hannah Heights following Nigel, L95</b>, and two more whales. Possibly Fluke and Racer? -Chris Grams

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:58 am - </b>There they are! <b>L pod on Lime Kiln</b>. -Gayle Swigart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:20 am -</b> Some <b>L pod members were seen off the west side of San Juan Island</b> this morning, their first appearance in the Salish Sea this year. More later as info comes in. -Howard Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Surprise! <b>L-Pod showed up on the west side this morning!</b> June 3rd is the same day the first Ls came "in" last year, too. Here's <b>L27 Ophelia with L82 Kasatka - L116 Finn</b> was with them too. It's just like catching up with old friends to see these guys after so many months! -Monika Wieland

Very unique <b>T encounter yesterday. At least 20 whales</b>, including the exotic <b>Ts and fan faves T65As and T137s. PLUS!!! The T124As, T86A1, and T100B</b>.
Their behaviour was very cool and perplexing. Social milling is the only way I could describe it. They barely moved a quarter mile the entire time we were with them, they were basically all in one clump, but not necessarily touching each other like you might expect from social KWs. Very little surface activity like spyhops or tail slaps. They were just spinning around each other in a big clump. Maybe somewhat of a cautious greeting/inspection toward the T125s? Lots of playful speculation that the ladies were drawn in from far and wide to meet these handsome strangers from Alaska to help maintain a strong gene pool down here if you know what i'm saying~ -Tasli Shaw

It was that kind of evening! <b>T127, Strait of Georgia</b>. -James Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

So so exciting to see the nearly-mythical <b>T125s </b>finally! Them and the <b>T65As </b>were on form chowing down in nearly the same spot for the whole encounter. Lots of activity and great vocals on the hydrophone! -Andy Scheffler

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I am beyond stoked that I got to see these guys!<b> T128 and T127 near Saturna Island</b> today. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>11:04 am - A pod of orcas</b> is just swinging by our place now, <b>Boundary pass, South Pender</b>. -Jennifer Conkie

Izzy Menendez who works for the Quilieute Tribe reported seeing<b> 2 orcas about 100 ft. from the mouth of the Quillayute River this afternoon around 2 - 3 pm</b>. Visitors at the resort there got some good photos.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

About 6 pm Tuesday there was another sighting called in by Ronald Lindbelom of probably the same <b>three orcas</b>, <b>about 2 miles north of Klaloch Lodge</b>, again about 100 yards off the beach. That's about 20 miles in about 3-4 hours.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:30 pm: West Beach Rd, NW Whidbey Isl.</b> between NAS Whidbey &amp; Partridge Pt, John Hartley reported one whale heading south, with a light colored small dorsal fin, possibly a <b>Minke</b>.

<b>L Pod </b>was reported <b>traveling South off Blunden Island</b> (off Tofino BC, west coast of Vancouver Island) around<b> 2:15 pm</b> today. They were off Wilf Rocks an hour later. Around 4:15 pm they were off Frank Island. When we caught up to them just after 5, they were past Cox Point. Despite their fast travel they were having a blast in the chop and were breaching, spyhopping, tail lobbing and cartwheeling. <b>L121</b> was sighted and was even seen in the care of <b>L41, Mega</b>. Also identified with the pod was <b>L25</b>, the presumed mother of Lolita, who is in the Miami Seaquarium. We left the pod as they reached Long Beach, around 6:20pm. -Marcie Callewaert/VMSC

Photos of<b> J Pod traveling north through Boundary Pass</b>, heading for Active Pass. J50 sandwiched in between her sister J42 Echo and mother, J16 Slick. You can really see the rake marks on her tiny little fin here, which is why I cropped it so close. I'm so grateful she survived whatever experience she had to go through to be brought into this world. -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Spent some time with <b>J pod </b>in Canadian waters which was very spread out, very choppy so hard to get nice clear shots, but confirmed <b>J27, J28, L87</b>...also got 2 babies, possibly J50 and J52....not 100% on that yet. Looks like they were all up there, I think I got Granny, too, she was leading the way with Onyx a little way behind her. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A good start to Orca Month - off we went to find orca. We traveled in <b>between the San Juan Islands out towards Stuart Island, and found J-pod!</b> They were spread out in small groups - our first whales were the <b>J16's with 5 month old J50</b>. Even though the seas were a little choppy, we had great views of them, and also caught up with <b>Granny, Onyx, Doublestuf, Princess Angeline</b> and many other whales. What a privilege to see these amazing whales, and the light rain we encountered didn't faze our enthusiastic passengers. A great day again. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

A couple of shore based shots from encounter with <b>J Pod</b>.  All <b>J16</b> matriline whales, but pretty cool that you can see these guys up close from the beach! -Jeff Hogan, Killer Whale Tales

I played a hunch today and caught the early ferry over to San Juan Island and caught <b>Big Mama (see humpback section) and J pod at Lime Kiln</b>. Then I headed out on the water in the afternoon and saw J pod again. It was a lovely, lovely day---if a bit damp. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:14 am - Just heard some calls on Orcasound</b>. -Jill Clogston

<b>10:40 am - </b>Freighter fading into the distance and silly<b> J Pod calls on Lime Kiln</b>. -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>S4 calls at 10:38 and whistling starting at 10:40</b>. Intermittent <b>echolocation starting at 10:23</b>, along with approaching cargo ship. -Gayle Swigart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:06 am - </b>echolocation now on OrcaSound hps.
<br/><b>10:39 am -</b> Loud <b>S4 calls on Lime Kiln hps</b>.
<br/><b>6:05 am - </b>turned on Lime Kiln and pretty sure hearing distant <b>J pod calls</b>. Heard them for about 15 minutes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:20 am -</b> I heard them (orcas) pretty loud on Orca Sound. -Connie Bickerton

Received a report from Nadja Baker - Deception Pass tours boat was with <b>two humpbacks (mother and calf) a few miles south of Deception Island, heading south around 2:30 pm</b>, then seen milling around Lawson Reef buoy.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The big surprise of the day. <b>BCY0324 Big Mama from Lime Kiln around 12:30</b>! I was sitting at a bench eating breakfast when I heard a very loud blow and ran to the rocks to find her close to shore and cruising south. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
