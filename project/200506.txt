<h3><center>June 2005 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>June 30, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
My husband and I spotted <b>orca</b> activity while crossing the Hood Canal bridge (east to west) to day. At about <b>3:50 pm</b> I looked toward the south while on the bridge and saw several splashes and black fins. There was another person watching and said he had seen five orca, including a small one. We watched this small group for at least 45 minutes. They were ranging north and south and appeared to be hunting. They spent several long periods underwater. A couple times one of the larger animals jumped almost completely out (horizontally). One appeared to be much smaller and there did not appear to be any bulls with the group. At least three of them had dorsals about the same size (medium). They ranged back and forth over the same area while we watched and appeared to be no more than halfway between the county park and Lofall on the east side.

<b>Grey</b> whale about 28-32 feet long feeding in a cove 1/3 down the East side of Lopez in inlet. Would surface about 4-6 times in 10-20 second intervals and then submerge for five to seven minutes. <b>J1 and J2</b> transiting about 1 mile N of Patos head SE. Rest of the J pod spread out about 3-4 miles.

We caught the <b>gray</b> whale still feeding just south of Lopez Pass around <b>1030</b>. Then we saw <b>L Pod</b> on the south end of Hein Bank just milling around. At <b>1230</b> we spotted the <b>humpback</b> that was hanging out, presumably feeding at the north end of Hein Bank. It was taking very long dives, but we did see it do a cartwheel. Then on the way home we spotted a <b>minke</b> on McArthur Bank at <b>1330</b>.

<b>J's &amp; L12's</b> were spotted several miles offshore of San Juan Island. Whales were spread out over several miles, with small groups here and there. J26 Mike did a wonderful tailslap display by doing almost a dozen in a row! Shortly after that we saw another whale pop up from under him, so we weren't sure what was going on there. Here's the latest from The RUMOR MILL:  We heard from a boat, who heard from a boat that heard from another boat (you get the idea) that there is yet ANOTHER L-POD baby!

<br/><br/>At about <b>5.15 pm</b> the <b>Six</b> were moving slowly towards (Maple Beach). No focused direction, no real traveling, no chasing.. with one adult female lying consistently on top of the water which was like glass... she appeared to be in a rest mode several times throughout our watch! When the older juvenile joined up first, the youngsters were rolling all over each other with Mom doing an occasional deep dive with fully arched back and coming up in the same place... like as in resting. The "kids" however were making splashes with dragging their flukes sideways across the water, some actual tail slaps. It was so peaceful their blows could be seen and heard but when the other three-some from further north came to join up we actually heard one of the younger ones' high-toned vocalizations which sounded like excitement. They continually rolled, porpoised, tail slapped a great deal, breached (backwards, sideways, etc.) and there were a lot of laying upside down with pec fins in the air and holding it for a long time it seemed. They usually were visible with part of 5 or 6 of them out of the water for periods of 15 + mins and longer. They eventually went out of sight southward, then picked them up heading into the Duckabush delta about 7.45 pm but they came back almost immediately round Quatsap Pt. doing lots of huge splashes from breaching, spy-hopping and tail slaps.

The slippery six (Hood Canal <b>Transients</b>) were sighted in front of Holly at about <b>8:50 pm</b>. They were quite active. I had about 25 seals close to the bank also aware that the "6" were in the area.

<b>J's &amp; K's</b> near False Bay, heading out towards Hein Bank. Once out there they milled about for awhile before deciding to head back into shore. Once at False Bay, they got very active for a brief time, then back to the slow milling towards Eagle Cove. Keeping to tradition of the West Side Shuffle, they changed direction several more times as they slowly milled North towards Lime Kiln. K-7 Lummi showing a couple of young'uns how to fish. Back and forth in bursts of speed within 20 yards of the Soundwatch boat! As the whales passed Lime Kiln near shore, they put on quite a show of breaches and other percussive behaviors for those waiting on shore. Then it was onwards towards Kellett Bluff.

HJ Carroll (WSPR) Marine Park, Dabob Bay, Hood Canal, <b>noon to one</b> in the afternoon, halfway between Pulali and Whitney Point, the six transients. The whales spent about forty-five minutes within in a small area of about 200 feet, moving in close formation. They travel a hundred feet south, then north, sometimes side by side, and sometimes closely passing each other. The babies appear to stay very closely beside
the mothers. At least two spyhops from one of the large (fe)males, and much tail-slapping. Appears to be a "kill" given small debris and attention of gulls. Group then moves slowly south towards mouth of Dabob Bay near Pulali Point. A larger transient group appeared in this spot frequently during the eight-week 2003 transient incursion to Hood Canal.

The <b>Slippery Six</b> (some or all?) spent an hour out in front of my home on Hood Canal (milepost 333 on Hwy 101, Potlatch) VERY early this morning. At about <b>3 am</b> there they were. I could not catch a glimspe of them.

<i>Number of animals seen</i> - 2 (<b>orcas</b>). 1 one was a baby 18 -23 feet long &amp; the other was big, so i am guessing it was the mom
<br/><i>Where did you see them?</i> there is a marker out front of La Push (the farthest one out) &amp; there is Destruction Island, I was heading to Destruction on a 155 degree heading going about 13-14 knots avg, about a half hour past the La Push marker, the Orcas were heading northish on the EXACT opposite heading of mine, just tooling right along
<br/><i>What direction were they traveling?</i> 335 degrees from destruction towards la push
<br/><i>When did you see them?</i> Just <b>after noon and before 1300 hrs</b>
<br/><i>What were they doing?</i> just getting right along, like they had somewhere to get, just porpoising, &amp; they were fast, on the exact opposite headin of mine, their speed &amp; time between coming up to the top &amp; going back down never changed, nor did their heading, for the 3- 5 minutes i watched them come at me, &amp; then I turned my head to look back &amp; they were gone
<br/><i>Playing</i>-no <i>Feeding</i>-no
<br/><i>Were there any males (very large fin on their back)?</i>- i don't think so, there was a "little" one about 40 to 50 feet off to her right and just slightly behind her nose as they moving along
<br/><i>Any unusual markings?</i> couldn't tell, i saw the black &amp; white on both of them, but, they moving right along, just popping up blowing &amp; going, Scars? - no time to tell
<br/><i>Have you seen whales in this area before?</i> no, and the guy i was on the boat said they weren't usually in the is area, that's why i'm reporting it
<br/><i>Did you get photos that may identify individuals?</i> no time.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J's &amp; K's</b> passing through Cattle Pass on towards American Camp. The whales seemed to be in absolutely no hurry as they gave us what is in my top 2 passes of the year---lots of what appeared to be play activity (or perhaps it was mating activity?), lots of rolling around on top of each other, tail slapping and tail lobbing. A nice breach by Cappucino, followed by breaches by other whales all around. J26 (Mike) spent a lot of time on his back with his pectoral fins sticking straight up! At first, there were sporadic vocalizations, then as the got closer to the boat they started vocalizing like crazy! Towards the end of this pass (it took nearly 20 minutes for them to go by they were so slow), a nice spyhop from we think it was J27 (Blackberry). Several times we also observed what appeared to be feeding activity with quick lunges (although we didn't see them eat any fish).

We saw a lone <b>grey</b> at about <b>8:30AM</b> just south of Lopez Pass on the east side of Lopez.  Looked like the same one reported there on the 22nd.  Only in about 7 fathoms, appeared to be feeding.

<br/>*<br/>
Spent some time with <b>K pod</b> around Eagle Pt. around <b>midday</b>. They were milling around quite slowly, quietly, changing direction often. About half of K pod went down for a deep dive about 200 yards away from the boat moving south, then surfaced within 50 feet, swimming right up to our boat; literally inches away. They circled underneath for a minute or so, surfacing often, before heading back the way they had come.

I was going to Dosewallips State Park for a beach walk this morning and about <b>9:10 AM</b> as I was driving just south of Hoodsport on 101 (headed north), I could see a number of wakes and all a sudden a "woosh" and a dorsal fin about 100-200 yards offshore! (Hood Canal <b>Transient</b> pod). They were slowly headed southward.

<b>L pod</b> on their way to Victoria in the <b>am</b> trip and then on the <b>afternoon</b> trip we caught up with them again nearing Race Rocks and booking for the Pacific.

Elaine Wiley of Ayok Pt. reported the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> mid-channel at Ayok Pt at <b>8:20 pm</b>, headed north in a tight pod.
<br/>*<br/>
Paul Shaumberg of Great Bend Charters in Union reported seeing 2 of the adult female Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at <b>3 pm</b> off Potlatch, on the Kitsap side, while two of the calves were off by themselves further south, near a lone seal......maybe learning to hunt on their own? The HC Transients had also been seen at <b>10 am</b> at Hamma Hamma heading south.

<b>June 21, 2005</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>9 am</b> we observed a pod of orcas (<b>K pod</b>) heading south past False Bay. From 9:30 - 10 am we watched the pod from American Camp - they turned &amp; were headed north.  At 12:30 pm they again passed False Bay heading north. From <b>4 - 6 pm</b> we were out with Tom McMillen with <b>K pod</b> between Lime Kiln &amp; Hannah Heights, west side of San Juan Island. At around 5:15 pm, about a mile off Hannah Heights, 19-year-old male K21 (Cappucino) came toward us and breached twice within a hundred yards. He's nearly fully sprouted now and is a very big boy. Soon he came up from behind us to about 30 feet away. At that point, his sister and only sibling,  K40 (Raggedy) just over 40 years old, suddenly turned and bee-lined directly at K21's head, as if they were going to butt heads. The water frothed and it was impossible to see what happened, but immediately K40 turned around and streaked away from K21 with a large salmon between her teeth. It's only speculation to assume that K21 gave K40 the fish. Their mother, K18 (Kiska) died about a year and a half ago.

What I think was <b>K pod</b> going south off the west side (San Juan Island) at <b>7 am</b>. Caught them again going south off the west side in the middle of a storm and rough seas at about <b>5 pm</b>. Many breaches, tail lobs, cartwheels and porpoising leaps. At around <b>6 pm</b> as the water was calming, I was watching who I think was K21 Cappucino and K40 Raggedy forage with a mom and calf about 1/2 mile off the Pile Point/Hannah Heights area. Suddenly a huge <b>minke</b> whale did 7 full breaches within several hundred yards of the orcas. Each time it went straight up with its full body out of the water, turned, and then slammed down. It was definitely a minke, since I could see the white stripes on its pecs, the white belly, and even the throat pleats. I did not notice any change in the orcas' behavior--even the calf kept leaping and porpoising without any noticeable change. When the minke was done breaching it swam rapidly towards K21. The last I saw it, it dove within what, from my perspective, looked like about 50 yards from K21. I saw K21 again, but  was not able to see the minke. As I was leaving, I saw several other orcas change direction and head towards the area where K21 was foraging.

Watched the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> mosey around Maple Beach at a slow pace heading north today. They were milling around a bit but for the most part were underwater for long periods of time. I spotted them around <b>4:30pm</b> south of Scenic Beach Park in mid channel heading north. Lost sight of them heading around oak head towards Bangor around 5:15pm.

As we headed towards Cattle Pass, we encountered <b>K Pod &amp; L-Pod</b> together! The leaders were a good two miles in front of the trailers, with whales spread across several miles from side to side as well. Good to see L-57 Faith. And we spotted a few of the new calves as well. As the whales approached Lime Kiln, they veered off from shore and most of the L's stayed down south while the K's continued North. They were in 2-3 tight groups until they passed the Turn Point Lighthouse. There they got into two tight groups and milled in Boundary Pass for awhile. Then they decided to head back down to Lime Kiln.

Kathy Cole had some hard core evidence that the <b>Six</b> had not left and Josh &amp; Co spent a good few hours with them in late afternoon and early evening. Kathy had been with the Six south of Triton Head for about 30 mins prior to <b>12.45pm</b> where they were last seen traveling north. Josh picked them up east of Hazel Point nearer the Kitsap Penin south of Bangor Base as far as Thorndyke Bay on the west side where they had to leave the transients just starting dinner... they were killing a seal.... at about <b>7.10 pm</b>.

We caught up with a very spread-out <b>J-Pod</b> near Moat Point, and they were fairly active with tail slaps, tail lobs, and breaches. We saw J-27 Blackberry off by himself, and just as we were leaving, it appeared that J-1 Ruffles may have been fishing as he changed direction several times quite quickly.

Hood Canal <b>Transients @ 7:15 PM</b>, very close on the west side (could hear them breathing), just off Duryea Point, just north of Dewato Bay.  They then moved slightly northeast, breeched a couple of times due west of Liliwaup, then circled and tossed a seal, and another unidentified animal.  Everything happened within 20 minutes. They headed north toward Ayock Point.

<b>Transients</b> in San Juan Channel, passing by Speiden Island towards Sentinel. They headed on over to Stuart &amp; the Turn Point Lighthouse and then onwards up Boundary Pass. Down the West side of San Juan Island where the <b>K's &amp; L's</b> were doing their thing. As we headed down, the whales decided to get their aerobic exercises in and started porpoising at about 10 knots towards Port Angeles. A rumor of J-Pod near Sooke headed inbound may explain their speed swim. Then a report of abundant minke whales at Salmon Bank had us heading south. We only saw one very large <b>minke</b>.

I watched the <b>HCTransients</b> for about an hour. They were first spotted south of Pleasant Harbor at <b>6pm</b> in travel mode. They were heading north very close to the west side. The Orcas passed by the Dosewallips and kept going, trying to make headway against the current in very choppy water. Then the group stopped near Seal Rock to make a kill with seagulls picking up what was left. Lost sight of them heading north up into the mouth of Dabob Bay around 7ish.

It appears they made a kill here as they were doing there after kill play routine. Also there were several seagulls overhead. By the time I got around to Union they had switched from their feeding routine to their travel mood. They were staying under for up to fifteen minutes. I followed them to Twanoh St. Park.

Again they were fairly active with some spyhopping and showmanship. We caught up with them at the San Juan County Park where some circled the little offshore island. By this time it was probably 4 pm and we continued to observe them move north.

<b>L Pod</b> decided to come back and do an early morning "west side shuffle" while they waited for J's &amp; K's to arrive.

We saw large numbers of <b>orcas</b> in the <b>evening</b>, as many as 10-12 from our viewing site at the Westside Preserve overlooking Haro Strait. The group was traveling north and came into view about <b>7:00 pm</b>. They swam around in the area immediately in front of us doing lots of tail slapping and pectoral fin flapping, a couple of spyhops and one spectacular full breach over the course of about 30 minutes in the area.  There were so many spread out over the vista that it was difficult to know which way to look. They were close enough to shore that we easily could hear their blowing. They left heading south again.

In the <b>afternoon</b> we had a SUPERPOD (<b>J, K, &amp; L Pod</b>) coming towards False Bay from BC. The whales were spread out over a large area for most of the day, until they got near Open Bay (San Juan Island).  Waves were 3-4 feet at times, making observation tricky at times. There they began grouping up and we saw a lot of percussives--multiple breaches, tail slaps, tail lobs, cartwheels, and several "sea snakes". We even had 4 double breaches (2 whales breaching at the same time!) Good to see J-1 (Ruffles) wasn't the only big male around as the L Pod males were struttin' their stuff as well. Towards the end of the day we heard a rumor of a baby orca in possible distress and swimming a bit listlessly, but it turns out that it appears that L-47 has a new baby! The baby was observed by Robin &amp; Candy with Cascadia Research to be swimming in close attendance of L-47 and an auntie.

I usually don't write in a redundant and late sighting report, but the behavior I watched <b>J pod</b> perform was awesome yesterday. We had J pod just southeast of Point Roberts, traveling south in their family groups at about 3 knots. Then all of the pod grouped up and slowed to a crawl. All of a sudden at least 15 whales breached, multiple times, at the same time for about five minutes! They were breaching and tail slapping but no spyhops. Then they spread out in a line and started moving south at a quicker pace with an occasional breach. Looked to me that they were organizing to begin foraging. This had to be the best I have ever seen in 15 years. It's always really nice to see J-1 (Ruffles)  and J-2 (Granny) put on an aerial display. I heard K pod was a couple of miles behind the J's but couldn't confirm that.

After crossing over Salmon Bank headed west, we approached the distant blows cautiously about <b>6:30 pm</b>, slowing to near idle speed and moving away from shore. About a mile outside of False Bay there were <b>orcas</b> all around us, but all of them too distant to make any IDs. Suddenly a whale breached 200 yards away, followed by a taillob, then one pivoted on its rostrum in a full cartwheel, then a juvenile rose in a high spyhop, belly side towards us, where the its best stereoscopic vision faced directly at us. A few came toward us, one flying by the boat a few feet under the surface, upside down, as if to inspect us. They were spread a mile or two apart without much consistent direction except that gradually the whole disorganized blob of whales moved due south toward Dungeness Spit. There seemed to be a lot of foraging, with occasional breaches and lobtails raising white splashes further and further away.

Howard just called in a report from the Passport to Puget Sound Cruise taking place tonight - they are way out off False Bay in Haro Strait, <b>7:30 pm</b> and are seeing <b>orcas</b> spread out all around them, breaching, tail-waving.
<br/>*<br/>
Approx <b>12:45 pm - 1:00 pm</b> I spotted the <b>Slippery Six</b> just North of Potlatch, about 1/4 of the way in the canal off the east bank. Then again at 1:30 pm - 1:40 pm they were just north Dewatto, breaching, spy hopping, rolling and just having a good old time. Again about 1/4 of the way in the canal off the east bank. Then starting moving closer and closer to the shore line, making diving movements in a circle formation. If I didn't know better I would swear they were on the beach. This continued for about 10 minutes. They then started heading north again in a single file with their dorsal fin just breaking the surface.

We observed the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> around <b>8:45 am</b>. They were traveling south. We initially noticed them splashing a lot off of Lilliwaup then they began traveling south past the Glen Ayre resort. Our final observation was them off of the Finch Creek Hatchery at Hoodsport. We observed the orcas again at around Noon, this time heading north, closer to the eastern Shoreline.
Lots of surface play in one area for about 30 minutes just south of Cougar Spit, then they continued with regular travel north.

Kathy Danworth of MAKINPICZ called me and said the <b>Slippery Six</b> were passing the front of the Holiday Beach area at <b>8.30 am</b>. They were pretty playful Kathy said, with some breaching etc. yet moving towards Hoodsport.

At <b>12.15 pm</b> Brian McLaughlin, and his crew from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab called to say they had seen a few blows of the <b>transients</b> in the area. About 10 mins later George called again and said the orcas were interested in a geoduck harvester boat (which was stationary) and the Six in fact had surrounded it! The crew could see blows on each side and then a good-sized harbor seal had jumped up on the dive steps and actually got behind it. Apparently the boat crew tried to dislodge the seal but couldn't. They said the orcas appeared to be traveling north after the boat.

Well, with the return of <b>K-Pod</b> yesterday, we thought now if only L's would show up. We heard that the <b>L12's</b> did indeed come back in and were between False Bay and Open Bay (San Juan Island) most of the day. We were coming down the back of Henry when J-Pod decided to go back North, so we were happy to wait for them. And Ruffles, that 54 year-old rascal did a beautiful spy hop, followed by not one but TWO breaches! We also noticed that J-8 Speiden appears to have a new nick at the base of her dorsal fin. The whales were very active until they passed Kellett Bluff, then they settled back down into travel mode.

Judy Dicksion called to relay a report of the Hood Canal <b>Transients</b> at Case Shoal off Squamish Harbor just before <b>12:30 pm</b>. A boat out harvesting Goeduck had been surrounded by the whales, &amp; a seal jumped on the swim step of the boat &amp; they were trying to get the seal off, to no avail......

<b>J-Pod</b> returned to the area with some "friends"--<b>K-Pod</b>! As we waited for the whales to arrive near Moat Point, we could see orcas spread out in large groups, with lots of breaches, tail slaps, and other percussive behavior. And once we dropped the hydrophone in the water, we were treated to the most incredible array of vocalizations I have ever heard. They were so loud and ranged from simple notes to complex combinations of squeals, whistles, and grunts. We watched the whales continue on towards Active Pass.
