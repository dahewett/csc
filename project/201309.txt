<br/>ents)	

 Had a nice (if rainy) encounter with the <b>T60's in Haro Strait </b>this <b>afternoon</b>.  - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 29</font></b></center>
<br/>

Rescuers save humpback from a tangle of ropes. When whale watchers found <b>Foggy</b>, about<b> 1 p.m</b>., the <b>humpback</b> had rope wrapped around her head and across her blowholes, and around her peduncle (the narrow part of her tail, just ahead of the flukes) and was dragging a mass of old lobster traps beneath her.
The whale disentanglement crew from Campobello Island freed Foggy from a tangle of ropes and gear. Grommet never left the side of Foggy, a humpback whale entangled in fishing gear, and the instant rescuers cut the ropes from Foggy, Grommet breached.

The Peregine and Maya's Westside Whale Charters saw <b>Transient Orcas today</b>. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>14:26 -</b> hearing faint <b>calls and whistles</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:52 - </b>Now it's becoming more <b>orca</b> like. Maybe the distance is making them sound more like dolphins. Should be around Constance Bank, based on the report from when they were off Race Rocks. 
<br/><b>1:51 - </b>I am starting to pick up some faint <b>vocals on LK</b>, but they don't sounds quite like orcas to me... Can anyone else hear this? - Marcie Callewaert   

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I spotted <b>a Grey or Humpback off Duwamish Head</b> around <b>11am</b> this morning, heading west out of <b>Elliot Bay</b>.  - Peter Sergeeff

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

Picked up the <b>T-60's just outside of Cowichan Bay</b> and watched them slay Stellar's Sea Lions. Great end to a great year, doing the greatest job on the planet... - Lance Underwood

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T011s sighted off Sooke BC</b>. I was able to ID T011A.  - Josh McInnes  

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

It was a long trek, but it was worth it. The<b> T60s west of Race and a Humpback </b>on the way home. My passengers were five lovely ladies from Minnesota who are working on a reality travel TV program, THE TRAVELING YA YAS...Great fun! - James Mead Maya 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 26</font></b></center>
<br/>

A magical, glass smooth, sunshiny day with <b>almost all of L-pod</b>, with many family groupings, tail slaps, a few breaches and spyhops, a glimpse of both babies Joy and Cousteau....lovely day!  Thank you whales! - Bonnie Gretz 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4 Transients </b>travelling in Canada south from the <b>Westshore Coal Terminal towards East Point</b>. They were <b>T037 and T037A</b>. And most likely T037A3 and T037A2. I did not see the T037Bs.  DFO's Jared Towers told me "The T037Bs have been known to disperse as has T037A1. T037 is also often found separate from the rest of her family. This group is really quite fluid compared to most, even though the dispersal behaviour is quite common in transients in general." - Peter Hamilton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
  
A group of <b>about 7</b> came in fairly close to <b>San Juan County Park</b>. They moved out past the island off the shore.. but they were about equal the distance of the island by the park.. a couple of them lingered around the kelp bed. - Vicky Doyle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were with <b>5 transient killer whales</b> near the <b>Southern Gulf Islands. T109 A's</b> - a mother with 2 babies and a calf and T12 A an enormous male. They were eating a harbour seal, their main source of food. After feasting the whales became quite active and naturalist Jen noted at least 15-20 breaches and the two juvenile whales breaching simultaneously. Transient orca aren't generally this active, and it was noted today was so spectacular it was better than a show at Sea World. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 pm - </b>On walk on <b>False Bay Rd</b>. South of the actual False Bay... too far for any ID's... counted <b>3-5 dorsals</b>, one for sure a male. Lots of splashes, very exuberant activity. Headed North... but as I headed back home... splashes way out on Haro at that point. Big splashes, probably from breaches. - Cher Renke 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 25</font></b></center>
<br/>Resident orcas - Skipper Rush on our 12:15pm tour towards <b>San Juan Island met up with the J and K pod killer whales</b>, over 40 whales, including five spy hops and five breaches before the whales started to disperse!  - Prince of Whales Whale Watching 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:16 am - Js and Ks passing San Juan County Park</b> northbound! - John Boyd 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:33 - Whales on lime kiln</b> right now. - Katie Snyder

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:24 -</b> hear clear faint <b>calls</b>. Earlier about 7:15 thought I had heard really faint calls but never got louder for confirmation, but here they are. - Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 24</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>4:00 PM - Pods of Orcas</b> were travelling east near shore north of <b>Freshwater Bay along north shore of the Olympic Peninsula</b>. I was fishing from a kayak 2 miles north of Observatory Point, Freshwater Bay. Several Groups of Orcas passed between me and shore travelling east from Salt Creek to Angeles Point. Two groups of whales following about 1/2 mile apart. Then two larger whales passing closer to my boat. Some were breaching. The groups were very tight. One photo shows 7 fins and one blow hole in close proximity. I kept my distance, but 2 passed within 25 yards of my kayak. I stopped moving upon sighting of the whales. - Dan Kuwitzky 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Fantastic encounter with the <b>T10's off Victoria</b> today. What a great day! - Lisa Jellison

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
Tom Elwok called to say he saw <b>a humpback whale</b> several times in <b>Georgia Strait</b> just north of Patos Island at <b>2:20 pm</b>.	

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

LOTS OF <b>ORCAS OFF LIME KILN POINT</b>!!! Saw numerous orcas at Lime Kiln Point from <b>12:22 until around 2 p.m.</b> At least 15 in all. A few moved by fast but several stopped to play and feed. It was amazing! Also saw 2 dall's porpoises, 2 harbor seals. - Cindy Hannon 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We got to see members of <b>L Pod and a few K Pod Killer Whales</b>, very spread out. <b>L92, "Crewser"</b> decided to come near and check us out. This image was taken when he was behind us and is very cropped to show detail. - Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

3:12 PM EST (<b>12:12 Pacific</b>) - Listening from Pittsburgh, hearing faint <b>orca calls on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone</b>. - Peter Moe

Whales got timing - and my ED and others were thrilled.  <b>Most of L pod and K pod were in Puget Sound</b> Saturday. They went <b>almost to Vashon</b> then turned around. We left them heading north by <b>Alki Pt around 5 pm</b>.  We had Friends of the Earth's Executive Director in town from DC - made his day for sure. - Fred Felleman 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b> K &amp; L pods journey to Puget Sound</b>. A little bit of tail lobbing, lunge feeding, &amp; breaching as they traveled past Edmonds and Richmond Beach. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Amazing day on the water with <b> Southern residents K pod and L pod in Puget Sound.</b>. - Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
   
We saw <b>whales on the ferry between Seattle and Bainbridge Island</b> in the afternoon.  Not only is it great to see the whales, it is such a communal experience on the ferry.  People put down their ipads and phones and go out on deck and with 5, 50 or 75 others, everyone is excited. - Jane Allan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:53...</b>we leave them in the waning light, a breach mid channel sightline <b>Fay Bainbridge and Golden Gardens</b>. Magical day! - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><b>2:21 - </b>I see them from <b>West Seattle</b>, just north of Eagle Harbor - looks like the ferry is running at slow speed either to protect them or get a look! - Kim Sharpe Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The season is getting better everyday. We caught up with most of the<b> Southern Resident Orca population in Boundary Pass</b> today. They were in huge resting groups, slowly moving along the rocky shoreline of Saturna Island. More fins than you could count, all at the surface in tight groups. We moved slowly along with them until they reached East Point, at which time they started to wake up, spread out, and pick up speed as the backdrop changed to open water and mountain tops. I love September! - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 18</font></b></center>
<br/>

Transient <b>T020</b> was spotted off <b>Victoria</b> today. I was told T021 was not with him! Lets keep an eye out. T021 is a close companion of T020. - Josh McInnes

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:59 pm - T20 &amp; T21</b> vocalizing on<b> Lime Kiln</b>. Transient vocals are so spooky! - John Boyd

<br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 17</font></b></center>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>T41A's new calf</b>. Looks to be only a few weeks old. - Gary Sutton.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K33 Tika was off of Lime Kiln</b> this windy, rainy afternoon. - Monika Weiland,

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">September 14</font></b></center>
<br/>

Spent about a half hour with private <b>whales off Williamson Rocks and Allan Island before they vanished in Allan Pass</b> (NW of Anacortes).  There were 4 of what I perceived to be transients: an adult male with a slightly floppy dorsal fin, an adult male with a straight dorsal, an adult female, and a sprouter.  The two younger whales split off to play in a kelp bed off Allan Is, then treated us to a tandem breach!  I've never seen that happen before.  They continued to have boisterous play behavior, breaching, motor-boating, and peeking around above water in the kelp whilst the grown-ups were more serious off the shore (right next to our kayaks).  - Mira Lutz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Whales, whales, whales... Rolling and playing, breaching and cartwheeling, milling, socializing, foraging and finding salmon, it was all happening near <b>Pt. Roberts </b>on Saturday afternoon. So good to see the southern residents relaxed and mellow (as Tasli Shaw mentioned in her September 13 report), an especially heartening sight considering their absence this summer and heightened concerns about their welfare. There were few boats on scene, contributing to a quiet and peaceful encounter with the whales as the fog lifted over a calm, glassy sea. A truly special day for passengers on "Mystic Sea". - Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We spotted the same group of resident killer whales that have been spotted off the <b>Vancouver</b> mainland throughout the week. Naturalist Karen identified the group as <b>L-pod</b>; one way to identify a group is by spotting a familiar whale--such as she did today, with the large male, <b>L88 "Wave Walker"</b>. There were other large males in the group being very active; with spy hops, breaching, and tail slaps!  - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

<b>J, K, L pods way up north by Point Roberts</b>. Amazing spy hops and breaches! This was my first time seeing orcas in the wild and it makes me super emotional...a very happy emotional. - Jamie Grundhauser

On the <b>Victoria</b> side of things, we had <b>transient killer whales that ventured right into Victoria harbour!</b> Early yesterday morning our Skippers Mark and Bo found the whales, known as the <b>T10s</b>, as they were traveling along the shoreline of <b>Beecher Bay in Sooke</b>. We met up with the whales near Albert Head as they continued to swim East towards Victoria. <b>By 3:00pm, the whales were at the breakwater to the harbour</b>, and minutes later were right in <b>Victoria Harbour</b> at the famous Fisherman's Wharf! They then made their way towards <b>Race Rocks</b>. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Less than two weeks after their last visit, the <b>TO10's</b> were at it again today as they visited <b>both Victoria Harbour and Esquimalt Harbour:)</b> The three Transient Orcas that make up this pod, <b>T010 a female born in 1963, and her 2 sons TO10B (born in 1983 and TO10C (born in 1999) </b>were first picked up in the fog west of Race Rocks this morning and made their way towards Victoria during the morning.  - Andrew Lees

My son just came home from fishing, and told me he saw <b>2 orca's off Possession Bar (S end of Whidbey) </b>around<b> 1:30 or 2pm</b>. He saw them come up once, and they disappeared. - Connie Bickerton

Its hard to explain, but based on the whales' behaviour it really did appear that <b>they were in a "mellow mood"</b>. I'm not sure how else to explain it. They would break apart and forage for a time (which they did successfully, as I personally saw three examples of salmon in their mouths), then come back together and be very tactile and mill around with each other. It gave me the impression that they were enjoying time with full bellies, not worrying about rushing to the next feeding spot. It filled me with joy to see, not once this summer have I seen them so laid back. They were not diving very deep (lots of "sharking" behaviour) and the salmon were jumping all around (mainly pinks). It was as if they had the luxury of just letting the salmon come to them. It was wonderful to see them expend energy on socializing and playing, which they did when a freighter past by (the <b>K13s expertly rode the pressure wave</b> for a surprisingly long time, and the<b> J14s came speeding in</b> from over 600 yards away to join the surf club).  The sport fishermen that were in the area catching the same fish the whales were after seemed of little consequence to the orcas, as they ever so coolly passed between all the small boats. All in all, a very special day with the whales. I wish that they could always feel such food security as they must have had today.  - Tasli Shaw

Not far into the fog, at the <b>mouth of the Fraser River</b>, dozens of Resident Orca from <b>J and L pods</b> magically appeared!!  The orca playfully jumped and lob-tailed, spectacular displays of playfulness with these beauties.

We saw members of <b>J, K and L near Victoria</b>. We were out with Puget Sound Express. The orcas put on quite a show, full out of water breaches, spy hopping, tail slapping, thrilling.

Do you sometimes eat your dinner too quickly? Are you looking for a sure-fire way to slow down? My wife Lynn and I have discovered the perfect solution. We have discovered the perfect solution. In the middle of dinner yesterday evening, I saw something out of the corner of my eye - <b>a humpback in Georgeson Bay (Active Pass)!</b> We put down our forks and knives and quickly wandered down to the shoreline to watch this magnificent creature surfacing a half dozen times. Although we often get orcas coming through, this is only the second time in 15 years that we have seen a large whale in our lovely little bay. The photos hardly capture the majesty of the event. - Peter Reiner, Galiano Island

I had an incredible day on the water! <b>Minke Whale, Humpback Whale, and Bigg's (Marine mammal eating) Killer Whales!</b> We were with the Humpback Whale, when a bait ball formed in front of him. The birds suddenly launched and the Humpback came up almost in a spy hop maneuver with his<b> mouth wide open</b>. I've never seen a feeding Humpback in the area, this was so cool to see!!! - Traci Walter

Lots of <b>Transient Orcas</b> today. The <b>T130s</b> this <b>afternoon</b> outside of <b>Active Pass</b> and the <b>T137s and the T185s</b>. We left them near <b>Hein Bank at 7:00 PM</b> this evening headed toward Middle Bank. - James Mead Maya
