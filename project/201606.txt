With an early report from a ferry captain of <b>Transient (meat-eating) Biggs orcas north of Orcas Island</b>, we headed out into the sun/clouds, hoping they wouldn't continue north too far. We caught up with them just south of Matia Island, west of Bellingham. This group was identified as the <b>T100s</b>, and included a large male (<b>T100C</b>, who is only 14 but quite big already!), <b>about 4-5 females, a very young orange-tinted calf, and another calf who was approximately 2-3 years old, T100B &amp; T100B2 (First seen May 30. Mom was seen May 22 with no baby)</b>. They were extremely active, spy-hopping, breaching, obviously hunting though we didn't see any actual prey. The male must have tail-slapped at least 50 times during the time we spent with them! They were swirling around, changing directions, grouping up together, then split apart a bit to hunt some more. Very exciting to see these magnificent predators going about their business while we watch in awe! Also saw 5 bald eagles and some chubby harbor seals with their pups. On the way back to the marina, we stopped to admire the beautiful and varied landscape of the islands. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

My mom Karne Burke Behling just spotted <b>four common dolphins off West Seattle from the Bainbridge Ferry around 9am</b>! Eastbound! -Shawn Behling

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:10 a.m. - The common dolphins (15-20) are still in the Olympia area</b> - or they left yesterday and came back. They are just heading north out of Budd Inlet, very near Boston Harbor. They are very active. -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:14 a.m. - </b>WA State Ferries reports <b>3 orcas in Rosario Strait</b>, heading north near the east side of the ferry lane.
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:00 p.m. - Orca/albatross Monterey Bay CA</b> - Our whale watching boat found these albatrosses feeding on carcass in vicinity or orca sighting. In the general area of the bay there was <b>one male slightly apart from a group of five</b>. The group of five included one younger male and two young, according to our naturalist. -Jane Gelder

Coastal killer whales  - <b>1:30 p.m. - I saw 2 Orcas in the Columbia river at the Astoria bridge</b>. Playing. -Brent Davis 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">June 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>T137A. He and T100C (both 14-years-old)</b> were having a breaching contest last night. <b>North Rosario. Neptune Beach/Sandy Point</b> in background. (The T137's have become one of my favorite families in recent years, as we watched this young male try to attack two adult grays this spring (#56 and #531) near Camano Island. This family also skinned a harbor porpoise and launched it out of the water several years back right next to our boat.) -Michael Colahan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around <b>12 noon</b>, while in town we got word that <b>two bulls were northbound in San Juan Channel</b>. Marilyn Armbruster and I headed for Reuben Tarte County Park on the north end of San Juan Island where we arrived in time about <b>12:35 to watch these two big guys</b> navigate the waters headed north at a steady pace. We could see they were <b>angling west towards Speiden Channel</b> so we Reuben Tarte around 1:00 &amp; headed to a friends place on Spieden. From shore we watched them continue westbound maintaining a steady pace on the north side of the channel. At one point they looked like they might head south but eventually turned northwesterly and we lost sight. We left around <b>1:30 p.m</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Possible <b>humpback sighting at Talequah ferry area (Dalco Passage) at south Vashon Island</b> today approximately <b>8:30PM</b>. Lots of fluking and tail slapping. Exciting! -Ann Melone

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:20 p.m. - Two humpbacks spotted about 50 yards offshore of Marine Park near Point Ruston in Tacoma</b>, heading toward Quartermaster Harbor. Big blows, big sounds, lots of tail flukes. -Ranell Nystrom

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:10 p.m. - We found the 2 humpbacks south of Three Tree Point</b>. 
<br/><b>4:01 p.m. - They are in the path of the ferry between Fauntleroy and Vashon</b> now. Possibly heading North. -Eileen Wolcott

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:30 p.m. - Humpbacks are near Elliott Bay</b>, we can see a Harbor Cruise vessel with them. 
<br/><b>11:34 a.m. - These two humpback whales are movin'! Passing Discovery Park </b>now, still east of channel, heading south.
<br/><b>10:23 p.m. - Humpbacks heading south past Richmond Beach</b>, Humpbacks are one from last year and a smaller one...
<br/><b>10:02 a.m. - And 2 humpbacks between Kayu and Richmond Beach</b>, right by the beach. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:40 a.m. - Two large whales just sighted off Jefferson Head in Kingston heading North</b>. They did have dorsal fins. Both were blowing. Irregular surface, not smooth. Dorsal fin not remarkable. Blows were sizable. I would say humpbacks. -Nancy Langwith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We found <b>one of our very well known "Saratoga grays", #723 "Lucyfer", heading south just off Edmonds</b> on June 29. If I am not mistaken, he was the first of a small group of grays to arrive this year and was spotted in late February (February 17th by ON staff- ALB). The grays are usually gone by now as they will feed on the outer coast for the summer and have only been known to come in to Puget Sound for about a month and a half (Feb/March-April/May) to feed on ghost shrimp. It is now July, so this is rather alarming since he should be gone by now. Hoping his reasons for staying behind are that he's finding plenty of food in here still. The fact that he was not in Saratoga and heading south toward Seattle is a little worrisome. Generally, when a gray whale is found around Seattle or south of it, they are juveniles that are lost and/or already dying. We headed south on our second trip and found humpbacks again, but not "Lucyfer". Hoping we will see him again and that Cascadia is able to monitor his condition if he stays. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:56 a.m. - The humpbacks are heading south towards Shilshole</b>, still on East side of channel, <b>Gray whal 723 Lucyfer was mid channel between Point Wells and Kingston heading South</b>, we will try to pick him up again later.
<br/><b>9:59 a.m. -</b> We (Chilkat) are with<b> Lucyfer #723 grey Whale off of Point Wells!</b>! He is currently heading South. -Janine Harles 
  
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:44 p.m. - dolphins</b> are still out. Just to <b>north of Southworth ferry</b> right before the turn to Vashon. -Joslyn Cynkus Mintz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Common dolphin mom and calf central Puget Sound</b>. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Common Dolphin in the Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry lanes</b>. There were about a dozen, so cute, and had a baby with them. -Janine Harles, 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

(<i>reported as orcas, but more likely this is the pod of <b>Common dolphins</b> seen later in the same area. We had no other reports of orcas in Puget Sound</i>)
<br/><b>11:52 a.m. - </b> just sighted several Orcas moving across in area of Portage and Vashon Island..north of Point Robertson. Just saw them moving across surface, no breech. Looked like 3 or 4. Nothing moving now. -Laurie OBrien

San Juans - Ken called Dave at home in the morning to relay a report of <b>transients heading north at Land Bank</b>. Dave headed over to CWR and could see the whales off Bellevue Point from the porch a little before 1000. By about <b>1025</b>, the whales moved in and the young whales hunted briefly at the reef <b>in front of CWR before continuing north</b>. These whales were the <b>T36's, T99's, and T49C (nine whales total)</b> and they were loosely spread out as they passed CWR. We later heard that the <b>T73A's passed Lime Kiln about an hour later</b>...Excerpted from CWR Encounter 60 -Center for Whale Research 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Sightings of transient mammal-feeding orcas have been astounding this year..Another incredible day with <b>approximately 7 different matrilines (over 20 whales) doing some crazy socializing near Mandarte Island!</b> -Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Afternoon <b>T-Party at Mandarte Island. 23 whales: T36, T36A's, T36B's, T49C, T73A's, T75B's, T99's, T123's, T124C</b>. -Barbara Bender

<b>8:50-10:30 a.m. -</b> We first watched the <b>T36's, T99's, and T49C from shore at Land Bank</b> (west side of San Juan Island, WA) who looked to be finishing up a kill. They then moved northbound at a slow-medium pace, as they continued on we could see from the distance they cut in very close to the rocks at Lime Kiln. We missed them there but got ahead of them at <b>County park</b> and watched them pass slowly northbound - some nice lazy tail lobbing, looking to be winding down into resting. We left County Park as they were in front of the Center for Whale Research around 10:30am.  (per CWR: <b>T36's, T99's, and T49C (nine whales total)</b> -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network.

...San Juans - On our evening trip at approx <b>6:30pm</b> we caught up with <b>a big group of transient orcas coming south from White Rock. We saw T36As, T75Bs, T123's, and T124C.</b> We observed lots of milling/hunting behavior <b>between Flattop Island, the Cactus Islands, and Spieden Island</b>. At one point two of the orcas began high speed chasing after something - presumably a harbor porpoise. We also saw a couple distant orcas between Flattop and Jones Island, but didn't get a chance to see who they were. T124C was mostly separate from the group. The others ended up heading south down San Juan Channel and were <b>aiming at Yellow Island at 9:30pm</b> when we left them. -Barbara Bender/David Howitt

<b>Approx. 10:30am</b> I thanks Leslie for the phone call that there were <b>Orca seen from the Bainbridge Island I ferry</b>.  Approx 11am, I started watching from Rockaway Beach, Bainbridge Island with Sue,<b> a group of Orca, Seattle side</b>, with research boat and Chilkat. Then, we spotted <b>another group, BI side, just north of Eagle Harbor</b>. Headed north to watch them from Rolling Bay (4 - one male) booking north at a very steady pace. Watched for about 30 min, until about <b>noon</b>. Then, decided to go to Bella Luna (Suquamish). As we were eating lunch and watching for them, they were spotted again heading north about mid-channel, almost to Kingston/Edmonds. Thought they were gone, nope! They turned west and headed right for us! We watched as <b>they entered Agate Pass and headed to the bridge.</b> We packed up our lunch and headed back to BI. Goal was to get in our kayaks at Manzanita Bay and head out into the pass. Ended up just me and I paddled out to the middle so that I could see Agate Pass bridge and watch for them to enter. (Now approx <b>1:30pm</b>) As I got about 1/2 mile from shore, I heard an unmistakable WHALE BLOW FROM BEHIND ME!!! As I quickly turned around, shockingly I found<b> a HUMPBACK</b>! It was about 300 yards behind me. Took a couple of breaths and then a deep dive, heading west. 
I continued to paddle toward the middle of the channel and then met Susan Marie Andersson at Battle Point in search of the ORCA, but only saw the <b>Humpback surface 3 more times </b>and then disappear. Never saw any signs of the ORCA west of the bridge. Gorgeous day on the water!!! Sadly I have no photos. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

San Juans - Sunday morning we started our trip with sunny skies and warm weather. We had a light northerly wind and flat, calm seas. We cruised inner islands and caught up with <b>a large group of orcas off Java Rocks, in Canadian waters</b>, off Saanich Peninsula. We encountered transients <b>T123A and the T75s</b>, as they fed. The first spyhop of the day showed a female with a harbor seal in her mouth. Passengers watched intently as these stunning creatures breached, tail lobbed, and porpoised, perfect photographic opportunities with Mt. Baker as the back-drop. -Amy W. Mystic Sea and Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<b>7:55 p.m. - At least 7 orcas (3 male, 4 female) sighted passing Fort Worden, headed east toward Pt Wilson</b>. 2 large males in front and less than 200m offshore. At least 4 females, possibly with juvenile, farther out. Male in rear. Females lob tailing and breaching. -Rebecca Mostow 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We were at Botanical Beach, just o<b>utside of Port Renfrew. A humpback whale</b> slowly swam by; the back came out of the water, but the tail never did. It lingered for a couple dives at one spot, south of the access trail, off a couple rocks off the main shelf. Tide was 0.8 at 1245. Sighting was at approximately <b>1330</b>(I believe). We did not get any photos of the tail, for identification. Hope this is enough information. I've never seen them that close to shore, however I believe it drops off very quickly beyond the botanical shelf.  There are kelp beds directly off the shelf and the whale was only 20 meters off them.  Impressive! -Frank Gee (staff of Gulf Islands National Park Reserve)

<b>9:15 p.m. </b>Sunday evening. Active common dolphins in Budd Inlet feeding in front of Mt. Rainier. The <b>common dolphins in south Sound decided to head south into Eld Inlet</b>. Dolphins in Budd/Eld inlets. Lots of action during the feeding frenzy. All was quiet, except for their blows and surfacing series, and splashing around. Then, a few gulls screeching. Here is some very dark and grainy video as they passed by my house after having spent most of the last many hours north of here, feeding. -Kim Merriman
<br/><b>9:00 p.m. - they are still in the same area. S.E end of Squaxin Island</b>. They stalled in the area mentioned in the original post and began a feeding frenzy. They (15-20) of them were joined by their opportunistic friends.  -Kim Merriman

Tonight was a beautiful evening spent with the <b>T137s &amp; T124C between Orcas Island &amp; Peapod Rocks</b>.

The <b>T036A's and T075B's</b> never disappoint in the evening! These two family groups, called matrilines, make a deadly combination for any harbor seals in the area they're traveling through. These individuals are notorious for playing with their food ... punting a seal some forty-ish feet in the air, blood splattering everywhere, insane vocalizations, incredible social behavior, sunshine, engines off, and enjoying this without any other boats on scene for the majority of the time...Between Blunden Island and the Saturna shoreline. After already killing this Harbor seal, one of the Ts punts their prey some 40 feet in the air. Shows the power and precision of these mammal eaters. -Heather MacIntyre

We caught up with the <b>T123s near Skipjack Island around 2:15 PM</b>. They were looping all over the place. First they seemed to be aiming for President's Channel, but then they followed <b>along the north side of Waldron to Sandy Point</b>. Just when it looked like they might aim south to San Juan Channel, they flipped north again, then went west, and finally <b>east across Boundary Pass</b>. For whatever reason, they decided not to intercept the other group of transients that had just made their way down Swanson Channel. At 3:30 PM we left the T123s and headed over to the other group heading east along Pender Bluffs, made up of the <b>T36As and T75Bs</b> - six whales including two one year-olds. They were all slowly traveling in a tight group, and with their more predictable surfacings it was easier to get a good view and snap some photos. When we decided to peel off and head home around 5:15 PM, they were just at the bottom of Plumper Pass, seemingly undecided as to whether to head north or continue east. -Monika Wieland

<b>T049C in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on Saturday afternoon</b>. He's been swimming with 42 yr old female, <b>T091</b> who has no surviving pod mates for the past several days. When we got on scene with him she was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly he breached and began pounding the water with his flukes. He swam over near us and submerged. A couple minutes later she appeared in a strong tidal rip on the opposite side of the boat from where he'd been. She took a breath, submerged and they disappeared. Sneaky T's. Here one minute, gone the next. -James Gresham

Downwind sail against the flood through Cattle Pass to meet incoming transient orcas, <b>T46's and T73A's</b>. We all ran the flood up the west side. (San Juan Island)  We observed the kids playing with their food, a harbor seal lifted into the air. A great kerfuffle of bait fish, gulls, and rhinoceros auklets as the orcas surprised everyone surfacing from below the bait ball. Male orcas <b>T46E</b> was close alongside of <b>T73A1</b> all day, with frisky playful contact. <b>T46</b> born estimated 1964 was in the last live capture in Puget Sound's Budd Inlet, Olympia, but was released.

Gary and I are camping off <b>Point Wilson at Fort Worden - Admiralty Inlet</b>. Tonight we were perched in our truck by the lighthouse watching for <b>possible T's</b> that may be heading that way. We spotted 3 distinctive blows from 3 whales: two bigger blows and one smaller. A pattern of 3-4 blows then they would dive and resurface approx 4-5 minutes later as if feeding. The blows would appear about 5-10 seconds apart in separate vicinity but close together as if traveling together. We watched them until they traveled north out of our view. The behavior reminded me of grays as we have watched grays off the Oregon Coast for 30 years. But they could have been possibly humpbacks? Never saw dorsal fins. Anyone report any sightings??

We were on the search for killer whales, and hadn't found any after an hour and a half of our trip. That all changed when <b>J Pod, (and parts of K Pod</b>) found us! There's no better feeling then having the animals you want other people so badly to experience, and be inspired by to find you coming around the corner of Turn Point Light as you're about to start talking about the light house. It's a romantic notation, but it sure made my day.
On another note, at the end of the day, I caught a glimpse of <b>J53 with what looks to be a young halibut in her mouth</b>. This had a somber note to it because these orcas should be feeding on Chinook salmon right now. They should be plentiful, and coming into the Salish Sea to spawn in the thousands, or would have been doing so now historically. The fact that this little calf was eating halibut only means that there's still no fish for these big blackfish. -Heather MacIntyre

<b>05:15 PM - Two orcas -</b> My wife and I were watching the seals on <b>Cobble Beach on the Oregon coast</b>, when I noticed a large dorsal fin and then spout in front of me. I thought it was a porpoise at first, but then it skimmed the surface and I could see the head was much larger and the <b>dorsal was maybe 4-5 feet from water to tip</b>. Then my wife spotted another one as it peeked up out of the water to look at the seals on the little islands/rock formations in the channel. We watched them circle one more time before they went out to sea again. We were probably 50 yards from seeing the first whale. They were definitely <b>orcas</b>. We couldn't get a picture to turn out unfortunately. The dorsals blended in with the black rocks. Looked like they were hunting the seals in the shallows. <b>NW Lighthouse Dr, Newport, OR</b> 97365, USA Latitude: 44.674757 | Longitude: -124.078345. -Kevin &amp; Joanna Nesgoda

Beautiful! So many tail slaps, spyhops, pec slaps. At least 4 large males, 1 baby, and a slightly larger baby. From <b>Land Bank/Westside Preserve, San Juan Island</b>. <b>J14 Samish </b>continues northbound while other <b>members of J and K pods</b> slow to socialize and engage in tail lobs, breaches, pec slaps during their mid afternoon northbound pass off<b> Land Bank on the west side San Juan Island</b>. -Cher Renke

<b>3:00 pm. -  Whales at Lime Kiln.</b> Just a quick update, there were tons of whales everywhere mostly inshore. But I did see <b>K12s, L87, J2, J14's, J17's, J10's, J11's</b>. <b>All of the J's plus L87 were headed up Haro</b> - but there were loads of whales offshore that we didn't see. We heard lots of J calls. Maybe a few Ks. But I didn't see any Ls that I know of unless I got some far distant photos... In going thru my photos, I found the <b>K14's and I also saw K21, K16 and K35</b>. <b>5:24 p.m. - Passing Battleship. J2 Granny</b> in the lead. -Barbara Bender

The Southern Resident drought is over! <b>Members of all three pods came back into the Salish Sea</b>, and I think many of us breathed a collective sigh of relief as <b>one group headed up to the Fraser River while another did the westside shuffle</b>, indicating that perhaps there are enough fish to keep them here for a least a while. This evening I was lucky enough to get out with members of J and K Pods near Stuart Island... -Monika Wieland

<b>Approx. 1:00 p.m. - Out on the water with J &amp; K pod. Haro Strait, west side San Juan Island</b>. Whales were traveling north and south throughout the trip. The highlight, not pictured, was when <b>J39 Mako </b>breached RIGHT next to the boat, so close he splashed the front of the boat getting people wet. Beautiful, beautiful day. <b>K21 Cappucino -  Haro Strait</b> - West side San Juan Island. -Rachel Haight

<b>3:16 p.m. -</b> it's still in a northerly towards <b>Scatchet head </b>direction. Unbelievable breach and arch into a dive (never seen that before with this large a whale!). 
<br/><b>2:56 p.m. - Whale blow !! Must be a humpback or Gray</b>. Line of sight east of Point No Point and south of Scatchet head. Moving north towards Scatchet Head. As seen from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Approx 3:45 p.m. -</b> I was watching orcas off <b>Henry Island</b>. Just as the boats and whales moved east and behind the island so that I couldn't see them anymore, I heard 2 loud blows. <b>Then a large whale surfaced, blew, and dived with tail coming up, heading toward the same spot where the boats had been</b>. It was very close to shore which is how I heard the blow. I was on my deck at 45 Marian Pl. It seemed to be either a gray or a humpback. It was so exciting that I forgot to use my camera. -Jan Hare

<b>Approx. 4:45 p.m. -  from Lime Kiln on their return southbound</b>. Here's a special little photo to me, my favorite of the day. <b>Little L123 with mom, Lapis (L103), L122, and Muncher (L91).

Nugget (L55) and Takoda (L109). </b>Last fall a dear friend and I were the first to notice a new little fin and it turned out we weren't crazy and seeing things - Lapis had given birth to her first calf, L123! It was so thrilling to see this little one again knowing that it survived the winter and has grown so much since we first saw it last November. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

(<i>Below is observations by Capt Barbara Bender on an interaction between residents and transients</i>)
<br/>Sara- We caught up with the <b>T60's by Mandarte after we left the L's.</b> Thanks for Id'ing the two by LK. ...But before that, there was <b>a scuffle between R's and T's! We saw a female and male coming north in Haro while Ls we're going south. L92 made a drastic sudden direction change towards them. Then the L47's with L122 in the mix started high speed swimming toward them too in a tight group. Meanwhile they had been spread in loose groups beforehand. The T's took off porpoising the minute L92 turned toward them! It was intense! It was very brief before R's continued south again while the T's kept porpoising! I am not sure if the two T's were T60 and T60C who caught up with the others near Darcy or if it was others.</b> I would love to put these puzzle pieces together! Were there only two T60's in on the seal kill? Were the other family members near? Because the 2 T's were just two in mid Haro all alone. And per the CWR website the J's chased them away a few years back! -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw <b>J11s, J17s, and J22s.</b> -Katie Jones

Really nice to see the residents back in town! SPREAD OUT across the Strait of Georgia foraging. So nice to see a couple of the "Jabies", <b>J51 and J52. We had K12s, K14s, K16s but no K13s. Most of J pod too but didn't see any J17s or J22s.</b> -Gary Sutton

With Orca Month, as officially proclaimed by Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, well underway, it was with a sense of celebration that we welcomed <b>members of the Southern Resident community back to the San Juan Islands today</b>. With reports of J and L pods in the vicinity, we encountered <b>part of L pod off the west side of San Juan at around 12:15 pm</b>. Although initially traveling in ones and twos, we witnessed the whales grouping up close to shore as they headed north. To say that it was a privilege to see them in their natural surroundings on such a glorious day would be an understatement. Shore-based whale-watchers must have enjoyed a treat as the <b>whales passed by Lime Kiln State Park</b>. Passengers were also fortunate to see both a California sea-lion basking on the rocks and Steller sea-lions swimming near Whale Rocks, where two bald eagles were resting. How lucky we are to have such a diverse selection of marine life among these treasured islands. -Sandra Pollard (Author/Naturalist).

More notes by Monika: <b>J Group A with all Ks but K13s made it up to Georgia Strait</b> so they were all here too. I haven't had a chance to go through my photos but were L47s in there with L4s, L26s, and L43s.

<b>T60 and T60C</b> surprised us at <b>Lime Kiln </b>yesterday with a hunt on this harbor seal just north of the light house. At one point the seal made an attempt for the rocks but the whales cut it off and came in so close I'm pretty sure some people got splashed as T60 threw her tail around during a quick maneuver to intercept the seal. What an encounter!...It's always a privilege to see the top predators in our oceans and to see them hunting is both gut-wrenching and incredible....While the Bigg's killer whales do prey on marine mammals,  they're hunting the way they've evolved to and it doesn't mean they're mean or more vicious than their fish-eating cousins. It means they're a predator and they're feeding themselves and their families the way they've done for thousands upon thousands of years. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

On board the Peregrine with Captain Jim he had a report of <b>T124A's Biggs killer whales in Canada</b>. <b>Up Haro Strait, up Swanson Channel and into Trincomali Channel</b> where we caught up with the still northerly bound<b> T124As off Wallace Island</b>. They appeared to have prey with them as they would travel a bit and then pause for predation behaviors such as directional changes, tail slaps and deeper dives. This pattern continued most of the time we were with them until at last they picked up the pace as we bid adieu. Beautiful backlit blows, calm water, and great looks at a wild and free family. -Debbie Stewart

We were with <b>L pod </b>today! This is the first time they have been in the area this season so it was very good to see them. They were really <b>spread out and foraging off Victoria, BC</b> so it was a challenge to know where to look or point the camera. Again, a good problem to have! Two of the most recent calves born into the pod, <b>L122 and L123</b> were there and look fantastic, in my very un-expert opinion. Two adolescent boys hanging out - L105 Fluke (born 2004) &amp; L106 Pooka (born 2005). <b>L103 and her 7-month-old offspring L123</b>. Also got to see one of my favorites, L92 Crewser, who was having his very own photo shoot with Center for Whale Research. -Renee Beitzel

<b>L pod</b> is back! Here is a highlight of today's encounter with <b>Lpod off Victoria</b> during our morning tour. This was the first time Lpod had been seen in the Strait of Juan De Fuca this year! -Andrew Lees

<b>Transient Orca pod off Crescent Bay</b>, Washington... just west of Port Angeles. Seen about 9am. Slowly heading west. There were <b>about 8 of them</b>. 1 big male, looks like a sprouting (juvenile) male, 2 maybe 1-2 year old calves and a brand new baby (still dark orange) as well as 3 females. (ID'd as <b>T75Bs &amp; T77s</b> by Sara Hysong-Shimazu). -Don Baker

Juan de Fuca - As we left the marina (Anacortes), we heard of <b>L pod heading west off Victoria</b>. Captain Monte decided to make the long run and hope to catch up with them. It was a magnificent day, warm and sunny with flat glass smooth water. We made good time, but as the tide turned, the whales sped up and eluded us! The good news is that <b>L-91 and her calf, L122 were seen</b>, as was most of L pod. This is the first sighting of L pod this spring. We did spend time with <b>a lovely humpback on Constance Bank</b>, due south of Victoria, BC. His/Her tail fluke looked to be 100% black, making identification very difficult, although he/she had a very distinctive gray patch behind the dorsal fin. On the way back, a large group, perhaps 15+, of harbor porpoises were also feeding. It's unusual to see so many together! Also seen was a mature bald eagle, enjoying lunch on the edge of Lopez Island. Another lovely Salish Sea day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

I was taking the ferry from <b>Vashon to Pt. Defiance on the 8:00 pm ferry</b>, and saw three splashes...It was clearly a whale. But it was far away - <b>between Pt. Defiance and S.W. side of Vashon</b>...Then I saw all the boats turn and gather round. I never got any images. And, there is no way I could have ID's the species. (<b>unconfirmed humpback</b>, but one was reported same area next morning). -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30-8:00 a.m. -</b> My husband &amp; I were treated to an amazing humpback show of one this morning....with a lazy pattern of antics - on its back and slapping its fins on the water, frolicking, diving, then breaches. We are located <b>just north of Edmonds</b>... Whale was in between us and Possession Point on the <b>south end of Whidbey</b>. He/she was slowly heading north. -Laurie &amp; Paul, Edmonds

<b>7:10 a.m. - Humpback whale juvenile sited at Olympic View Dr and Sunset way. (Edmonds)</b> Was not moving for at least 10 minutes in same place rolling over a bit no breaching. Saw tail. Very very slow moving. From our home 9100 block Olympic View dr looking north west on Puget Sound. Pretty close in, could see easily with naked eye. -Starla Sage

<b>1:30 p.m. - Orca at Swiftsure bank.</b>...it was hard for me to determine that age of the orca, not that experienced, but definitely a young one.  As this juvenile went by our boat, there was another whale that passed on the other side of the vessel, presumably mum (?).  Also observed at least one other orca in the vicinity but too far to see much other than the dorsal, which was crescent shaped.  All were traveling westward out Juan de Fuca Strait as we were moving from the east end of Swiftsure Bank towards Port Renfrew.  All whales were traveling east rapidly, not feeding.  The fin and markings on the juvenile hopefully help with ID, photos with an iPhone. ("While I'm not 100% positive, this little whale looks like <b>it could be L117 of the L54's.</b>" Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research) -Kevin Neary

We spotted <b>a juvenile humpback </b>while boating in <b>The Narrows area</b>. First sighting was around <b>1pm</b>, just off of the north end of <b>Chambers Bay Golf Course</b>. We tracked the whale as it swam north, hugging the east shoreline, up to Pt. Defiance. Last sighting was <b>at about 4:15pm</b>, halfway between Pt. Defiance (Owens Beach side), and the south end of Vashon Island. We were hoping the whale might steer to the west side of Vashon, avoiding the POT shipping lanes, but we lost sight of it. :-( I sent a report with photos to DFW &amp; Cascadia Research later that day. -Julia Hurley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:15 p.m. -</b> I heard a blowing sound, looked &amp; saw a long dorsal spine and a large tail flip up, just like the <b>Humpback Whales</b> I recently saw in CA. I saw it twice and Kayakers came by from <b>Sunnyside Beach</b> (SW of Tacoma) confirmed they saw it. -Carolyn Adams
