<br/>

Well July finished with a bang! We got to watch group A of <b>J pod move from East Point to Blunden Island</b>. They were quite spread with<b> "Granny" leading the way </b>but the best part was watching the<b> J14's</b>, who were trailing, interact with one other. The kids, <b>J40, J45 and J49 </b>were doing lots of coordinated breaching and spy hops......it was awesome! The rest eventually joined in and I managed to get a picture of J37 breaching. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:26 - </b>Hearing more <b>calls</b> with echos. Very haunting. - Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:50am - </b>I just turned on <b>Lime Kiln</b> and they are echolocating. - Kelly Burns Keenan

Yesterday while cruising from <b>Gig Harbor to Tacoma</b>, we spotted in this <b>whale</b> in the distance.  At approximately <b>12:30 pm</b>, we were in Dalco Pass, near the ferry route.  The whale appeared to be heading NW toward the bottom of Colvos Passage.  The boater stayed stationary and must have had quite an experience as the whale appeared to dive immediately behind the vessel.  - Vicki Brown, Seattle, WA

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Three Humpbacks on the east side of Fox Island at 8:30ish</b>. They traveled south from the Day Island area and then turned around just before reaching Chambers Bay Golf Course. Last seen just north of the Fox Island Fishing Pier. Pictures to follow I hope! - Glenn Hansen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Well we found the <b>Humpbacks</b> in Puget Sound! Sounds like <b>Point Defiance Park in Tacoma</b> (5400 N. Pearl St., Tacoma, WA 98407) is the best place to spot them! - Whale Scout

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:05am -</b> A couple of <b>humpbacks</b> are just off <b>Point Defiance</b> near all the fishing boats! Seen them surface 4 times all in the same vicinity.
<br/><b>10:17 -</b> They have headed towards <b>Dash Point</b>.
-Michele Riley Campbell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8pm -</b> Kari and I saw a single lag (Pacific white-sided dolphin) working the rip off <b>Smallpox Bay &amp; Low Island </b>(just north of Lime Kiln State Park) tonight. - Doug McCutchen

<br/><br/>

<br/>

This evening from <b>5:00 til 6:30</b> I watched the<b> K14s</b> (four whales) head very slowly past<b> Lime Kiln</b> - in fact they were still there when I left, bucking the strong flood tide. In the continuing saga of the unexpected groupings this year, the rest of the whales that <b>had come down Boundary Pass earlier </b>in the day (at least part of J-Pod including <b>J2, and L87</b>) went back north up Boundary Pass. The whales (some Ks, some Ls, and maybe some Js too) that spent yesterday hanging off the south end of San Juan Island were westbound in the morning. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

From today alongside <b>Saturna Island, BC</b>! Was just a stunning day with beautiful flat water, and very happy popcorn type whales! In the course of 30 min, we saw nearly every type of behavior you could hope to see, what a day! - Traci Walter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Ls at Sheringham Light, near Sooke</b>. - Sooke Coastal Explorations.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas</b> passing our place on <b>Galiano Island</b>. - Gary Cullen.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

"Look Mom! I can walk! I can fly! I can blow bubbles!" <b>Echo, J42, today in Boundary Pass</b>, just north of Stuart Island, San Juan Island, WA. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 am</b> - We spotted <b>two orcas</b> a half mile off Gordon's Beach (Strait of Juan de Fuca, <b><b>between Otter Point and Sheringham</b></b>, about 20 miles west of Victoria). They appeared to be feeding. They were working the same deep water dropoff the fisherman work religiously out here. - Robert Johnson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:09pm - </b>Spotted <b>a pod off the southeast side of Whidbey</b> - can see them across the sound from Richmond Beach. Beautiful! - Jacquelyn Hanson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:35pm - </b>Just south of <b>Kingston</b>, mid channel at buoy Sierra Foxtrot <b>two humpbacks</b>. - John Slomnicki

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>A humpback at Turn Rock in San Juan Channel</b>, east side of San Juan Island. - A. Hammer.

These two have been awfully photogenic this year! It's <b>J37 Hy'Shqa with calf J49 T'ilem I'nges</b>, right off Lime Kiln this afternoon. If you're wondering about the names, all the descendants of J14 Samish have been named in traditional ceremonies by the Samish Indian Nation. Hy'Shqa means "blessing" or "thank you" and T'ilem I'nges means "singing grandchild". - Monika Wieland.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orcas</b> graced us with their presence in Active Pass twice. One group came close by us on the shore of <b>Galiano</b> around<b> 5 pm and around 9 pm</b>, a second small group stayed along the shore of <b>Mayne Island</b> on the far side of the Pass from us. Many boats, ferries and tugs hanging around both groups. - Karoline Cullen.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Whales just south of Henry Island</b>, San Juan Islands, WA. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It looks like <b>T34</b> with a new nick. - Gary Sutton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:07 pm - Whales on the Lime Kiln hydrophone! L-Pod calls</b>. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>3:00 PM - between Scatchet Head and Point No Point</b>. There were three whales at a distance feeding we think one was a small whale. One had a light swirl on its back. There was tail slapping and circling. A large Navy ship was going by at a high rate of speed and the whales were gone. Then suddenly they appeared next to our boat having gone a good distance to get there. - Vicky Turner

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:40 AM - 2 Humpback Whales sighted in Salish sea Between Race Rocks and Becher Bay</b>. Appeared to be feeding. As they returned a couple of times before moving off eastward. - Nieve S

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

We were in the ferry line in Friday Harbor to leave when I heard the <b>whales on the hydrophone at Lime Kiln</b>. We raced across the island and caught about <b>50 members of K and L pods</b> making their way north past Lime Kiln. They were so close to shore. An unbelievable experience! - Katie Snyder

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A crazy day. Some Orcas went north, then south, but other Orcas continued north, while some continued south...Very unusual day! We started the day seeing <b>Orcas ten minutes off the dock at Snug Harbor Resort</b> and Marina and ended the day with Orcas, ten minutes from the dock at Snug Harbor. - Capt. Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:06 pm. - Whales on Lime Kiln hydro</b>. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The "rogue"<b> L54 sub-group</b> finally decided to make their first appearance of the year in inland waters yesterday! I was surprised and thrilled to see them. Here's L54 Ino and L117 Keta, giving you a perspective of just how close these guys can come to the rocks at Lime Kiln. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:45 PM - Ls</b> were northbound past Lime Kiln at <b>9:30 PM</b>...definitely hearing Ks now, who had gone south when they "hit" the island a couple hours earlier. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:25am - Calls on Lime Kiln right NOW!</b> - Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:50am - pretty sure I heard faint vocals on LK.</b> - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:45 - Had J-pod with L87</b> at Beaumont Shoals, <b>south of Victoria</b>. - Corey Vink

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around<b> 8:00 pm</b> my husband was out fishing about<b> two miles north of Kingston </b>near the shipping lanes and he spotted <b>5 orcas</b> traveling east towards the Possession Buoy. He observed them traveling in a group and watched them slap their tail flukes on the water and raise them up in the air as they dove down. - Linda Bartlett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Orca pod on south end of Whidbey Island.</b> I was out fishing at around <b>8:00pm </b>saw a pod of orcas on the south end of Whidbey Island. There were<b> at least 6 whales</b>, but there certainly could have been many more. It was awesome. They were swimming East towards Edmonds. There were a few minutes when they were jumping and whipping their tails.
Nate Lord

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Amazing encounter when<b> 4-5 Transient Orcas</b> decided to swim east along the shoreline at <b>Point No Point</b>. I first spotted them 200-300 yrds out in the tidal current heading north, then they decided to head in to shore. <b>They came within 20ft of shore</b> and headed east back towards the point. When they rounded the point they headed off south east and seemed to go back into sneaky T mode. When I first started watching them, they appeared to be playing or hunting in the tidal current, moving in all directions. When they moved into shore, there were a couple of breaches, and lots of tail slaps. They were very active at the surface - no long dives. I also saw a couple of dorsal slaps, and upside down tail lobbing. They were not hunting. More likely post kill behavior. Dorsal slaps, upside down tails lobs, logging on the surface. It was pretty spectacular. Last saw them about 6:50 heading southeast back into the sound, and slipping back into sneaky T mode.
<br/><b>6:42 - </b>They are headed back south and trending east towards mid channel after a very close pass along the beach to the delighted observers. - Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Family of Orcas playing at point no point tonight 6 to 6:30 </b>came within 15 feet of shore very exciting. - Mike Woltersdorf

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:18 - From Edmonds </b>(north of ferry) we can see them mid channel where Rob reported. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:14 - </b>About <b>one mile off Picnic Pt</b>, one red &amp; aluminum colored boat following them.
<br/><b>12:08 - </b>Still heading south towards Edmonds, now off of Picnic Pt. - Rob Miller

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:23 - </b>Just saw them from Mukilteo heading south quickly. Moving<b> to Edmonds</b>.
Sara Troyer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:15 am - </b>WA State Ferries reports <b>4-5 orcas just north of the Clinton ferry dock</b>, foraging, no direction of travel.

<b>K12, daughter K22 and grandson K33 passing Victoria BC</b> on the way to San Juan Island Saturday evening. - James Gresham

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Our boat is with <b>members of K Pod and L Pod</b> right now. Reports of J Pod as well. Sounds like a Super Pod of<b> over 70 Resident Killer Whales</b>!! Everyone missed them until right about 4pm. They have been gone for 2.5 days and showed up late this afternoon coming in from the west.
<br/>6:05 - K's and L's for sure. K25 was harassing a Humpback whale earlier... J's are probably trailing... - Simon Pidcock, Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 -</b> Simon reported all three pods earlier and I've have heard <b>vocals of all pods on LK since 9</b>. They're still audible.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:19 - Lots of calls on lime kiln.</b>. Sounds like k pod? - Katie Snyder

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:55pm - Resident calls</b>, faint &amp; echoing, on<b> Lime Kiln</b>... - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:35 - K pod passing Victoria.</b> Inbound. - James Gresham

Jon Scordino received a call from Joe Petersen who was out fishing at 6am on 7/25/2014 and reported passing a group of 50-60 killer whales heading into the Straits just passing Tatoosh Island. Joe had reported the Northern Residents to us back in April and he suspected this was the same group because they spotted several large males with droopy/crooked looking dorsal fins. They have some photographs and I will send them on when I received them if any look useful.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br <b=""/>Humpbacks</div></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html> continued to dominate the strait today, with <b>no fewer than 9 reported in the area</b>! We love seeing humpbacks, and we're really starting to get into our peak season for spotting them. They'll only be more from here on out! We consider ourselves especially luck to be able to see humpbacks at all, given the fact that they were once extinct in this area. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 24</font></b></center>
<br/>

Mike Maurice saw <b>two orcas about five miles south of Tatoosh Island</b>.

The <b>J16s were heading west</b>, leaving yet another a new group traveling together in inland waters! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:45 PM - </b>We followed <b>Granny or J2</b> leaving her group. It was an amazing experience. <b>7-8 were seen close to Pender island</b>. - Paola Onorati

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Some of <b>"J" pod and "L" pod today off Sooke</b>, B.C. - Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 22</font></b></center>
<br/>

I woke up at 6AM this morning to go look for orcas. No black and white critters until early this afternoon, but I got to share my time with some other creatures. THEN, <b>J Pod group A and the K14's</b> started to file by the lighthouse (with Granny in the lead, naturally). K26 Lobo did a fantastic "buzz" by the rocks just beyond the kelp. What a gorgeous fellow he is... - Katie Jones

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At <b>1 PM</b> I watched members of <b>J- and K-Pods</b> head slowly south past <b>Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island</b>. They weren't making much progress against a strong flood tide! I think it's time we start keeping track of the whales by matriline, because the pod groups just aren't holding up this year. Present on July 22 was <b>J2, the J19s, the J14s, the J16s, and the K14s</b>. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon - 15-20 J, K Orcas heading south today at Lime Kiln Point State Park</b>, traveling south, also feeding posted a video of about one minute of two orcas that came in very close to the shore right in front of the lighthouse. - Sherrie Stahl 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 21</font></b></center>
<br/>

We saw <b>K21 Cappucino</b> and <b>K16 Opus</b> and her son at <b>Salmon Bank</b>. - Mariann Carrasco

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>"Group A" of Jpod (J2, J14s, J19 + J41, J16s) with the K14s</b> off <b>Point Roberts almost all day</b>. One very notable missing whale from the group was L87, often seen pasted to J2's side, he was confirmed to be present off San Juan Island's west side with the rest of the Js and Ks. When we caught up with them <b>in the morning (10:00)</b> they were spread over several NM, presumably foraging. Then they all grouped up and headed toward East Point, but turned around before they got to Boundary Pass and came back up toward the Fraser River.  They spent several hours traveling slowly along with the flood tide, surfacing in large groups. Once they reached the T14 marker they seemed to "wake up," lots of tail and pec slapping then promptly spread and out and, presumably, went on the search for salmon entering the Fraser. - Tasli Shaw

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today with <b>part of J Pod and K Pod!</b> Lovely day on the water for sure! Whales were socializing <b>up and down the west side</b>. - Traci Walter

South of <b>Victoria</b> with <b>Js and Ks, L87 and three Humpbacks</b>. - Capt. James Maya

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 20</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>10:10 pm - </b>still/again hearing <b>Southern Resident calls</b> on the OrcaSound hydrophones!
<br/><b>9:30 - still calling</b>, and no ships now. - Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30pm - SRKWs on both hydrophones</b> now... It was <b>Ks</b> at the end there on <b>LK </b>but there were Ks in earlier lead group too...still faint calls every so often getting less audible and here comes tankers from both directions. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L pod heading west at Sooke</b> (19-year old<b> L92 Crewser</b> is the male in the middle). - Sooke Coastal Expeditions

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The two matriarchs<b> T99 and T36 were a solid 0.5-1NM apart from the their offspring (36Bs, 99C)</b>, being stealth whales in the currents off East Point. After a period of erratic surfacing and 4-6 minute dives, the two of them came together at the surface, and slowly began heading NW, taking short dives, almost like they were catching their breath. As if on cue, the other whales (36Bs and 99C) came porpoising (like, super duper porpoising, whole bodies out of the water) in a direct line toward T99 and T36. When they all met up they milled about for at least 30 minutes, not going anywhere really, pushing their kill around at the surface, lots of blood visible in the water.
We later saw a pair of tiny fluke poking out of the water, indicating a harbour porpoise kill. Awesome behaviour to watch. If only we could hear how these two seemingly "called over" their kids for dinner. - Tasli Shaw

Our Saturna Island Marine Research Education Society put on an event just yesterday at <b>East Point, Saturna Island</b> with divers from the marine life sanctuaries society etc. At about <b>2 p.m.</b>, as if on cue all of <b>L-pod </b>showed up just off the beach <b>heading east in Tumbo channel out into Boundary Pass</b>. We had a spectacular showing of porpoising, breaching and general cavorting and no vessels following them, it was absolutely magical. In the 33 years I have lived on Saturna, I have never before seen the southern residents in Tumbo channel......amazing. - Robert Bruce

We had unusually high winds up north today which prevented anyone from finding Resident type Orcas this morning, although there was plenty of other wildlife to be seen.

I was on the Clipper and was first to spot them on our boat after reading updates on FB.

And more of an update from Jeff Hogan - now he believes<b> the number of orcas to be between 6 and 10, at 2:10 pm they were approaching the Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry</b> crossing, and seemed to be behaving more like Transients rather than Residents but they are still too far out to ID for sure.

<b>K-Pod</b> continued to do the <b>west side shuffle</b> today. Between <b>10:20 and 10:40 AM they went north past Lime Kiln Point State Park</b>, got as far up as Open Bay, then turned and came back south <b>past Lime Kiln around 12:30</b>. They also poked their heads as far north as Lime Kiln at 8:45 PM before turning and going back south. Meanwhile, <b>J-Pod spent the whole day up north</b>, with the <b>J16s coming down Boundary Pass and going back up Swanson</b>, while the <b>others by all accounts stayed near the mouth of the Fraser River</b> throughout the day. While we've had residents around on almost a daily basis for the last month and a half, it's interesting to note <b>there have been changing groups of whales here every week or so</b>. Since they all went out west on July 8th, for instance, there's been an interesting combination of whales in inland waters. For those "keeping score", present from July 9th onward in inland waters are K-Pod (minus the K16s and K21), L87, and from J-Pod J2, the J14s, and the J16s (no J19s, typically part of "Group A" in the past). It's easy to report "Js and Ks are here", but I think it's equally interesting that we're ending up with new and different combinations of whales all the time. It's been difficult but fascinating to keep track this year as we're seeing all kinds of new groupings!  - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Well, the <b>T137's</b> were at it again today. We have really noticed the curiosity these animals have shown towards boats but nothing prepared us for today!! They started hunting a seal right when we got there and didn't stop for almost an hour. We watched from a distance for a while but as the hunt went on and the seal tired, the whales ventured closer to the boat. We backed up and tried to move away but they kept coming at us. We shut down and they would let go of the seal go so it could swim towards our boat and then just as it was getting close, they would come nail it!! We could hear the seal wheezing in exhaustion and desperately trying to get to us for safety. We had to let nature take it's course and stay out of the way but WOW, what an incredible sight! - Gary Sutton

<b>2 pm - 10+ Pseudoorca or minke or pilot or Dall's in Dabob Bay between Pulali and Whitney Pts. Sorry I can't identify what we're seeing.</b> Just now, a "pod" of about 10 of something I've never seen in 63 years of observing from my home between Pulali and Whitney Pts on Dabob Bay. Leaping out of the water, probably feeding on runs of Pacific herring as were the white-sided. Too far out to get good pix with cell phones or video. Feeding avidly in clusters, leaping out of water almost completely, sometimes 4 in "formation," - this went on for about 45 minutes with maybe a quarter mile movement in front of our viewing spot here at our home. Pacific herring are running now. To me fins looked most like pilot whales, but can't find any sign they occur here. - Kirie Pedersen

I noticed the <b>gray whale </b>sighting in your last whale report. Where was that sighting? It says Juan de Fuca Strait but has no other specifics. It is not uncommon for gray whales to be out in <b>Neah Bay</b> at this time of year, though peak numbers are later in the summer/early fall. Although we see mom calf pairs too, those are usually a little earlier at the end of migration or stragglers in June. We saw the same<b> mother calf pair</b> outside of Neah Bay. I recognized the mom as the whale in the photo in your posting (the posting says it is the calf but that is definitely the adult) - she is a female we have seen in past years and have biopsy sampled. Cool sighting! - Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician III, Makah Fisheries Management

A large resting group ... my absolute favourite way to see them (maybe after a large cuddle puddle ...). 20+ fins at the surface in synchrony, it is hard to explain the stirring nature of the sight. Cuddle puddle: what happens sometimes when the whales are in big groups and being very social tactile with one another. They will just hang out, barely going anywhere and just rolling over each other and rubbing up against each other. It's beautiful!!! - Tasli Shaw

Words can't really describe today's trip. I'm in my eighth season and this ranks as one of the best I've ever had. We chased a report of <b>whales up by Nanaimo</b> and was lucky enough to find them around <b>Thetis Island. The T124A's, T137's and T077A were heading south towards Crofton</b>. They stopped at a reef on the way and battered a seal around and then celebrated like CRAZY!! We have had a few encounters with the T137's when T137A breaks off the group and comes over to check out the boat and he did the same thing today except breached right behind us. Anyways....words can't say enough so here are some pictures. - Gary Sutton

The story of the coolest thing that happened yesterday, the only time it's happened to me anyhow! So we're heading down to these resident orcas in the morning and can see the pile of whale watch boats still a mile or so off, when we come across <b>Onyx all by his lonesome</b>. So we pause and watch him for a couple minutes, then slowly tiptoe out of range and pick up a little bit of speed to go join the other boats and whales ahead. I was on the back deck talking about Onyx to the only 4 passengers who were back there, because we could still see him surfacing way behind us. All of a sudden, two whales exuberantly pop up just behind and to the side, surfing the boat wake! It was <b>J37 Hy'Shqa and J49 T'ilem I'nges</b>. I holler at the captain to cut the engines, and he complies immediately, but as we drift to a halt, the wake continues and the orcas keep porpoising along in it. They slowed right down with us and then surfaced beside us twice as if to say, 'why'd you stop? that was fun!' Were they just playing? Or using us to catch up with the other whales ahead? T'ilem I'nges slapped his tail a couple times, and then they moved on, continuing in the same direction we had been going. Didn't get much of a photo of the surfing, of course, with a long lens on + *SURPRISE!*/too much glee to function. The boat was already shut down and drifting when this first shot was taken. - Andy Scheffler

I just saw my first ever <b>greeting ceremony by the southern resident killer whales. J, K, and L Pod</b>s all circling, breaching, surface vocalizing, spyhopping etc etc and all within view of our boats!! Everyone came out, shut our motors off and just watched in awe as some of the most spectacular, magical, and social behavior that we have ever seen unfolded before our eyes. Probably the best day of my life. - Heather MacIntyre

Another EPIC day out there. EPIC, I SAY! <b>Superpodage</b> and all the goodness that goes along with it. J16 Slick, J36 Alki, and J42 Echo were nuzzling each other right before the great meet-up.- Katie Jones

This afternoon starting around <b>1:30pm 18 - 21 orcas</b> greeted us on the <b>south side of San Juan Island</b> just as we headed north into Haro Strait. Looked like orcas from <b>J, K &amp; L pods</b>. I counted 3 juveniles, 1 calf, 10-12 females and 4-5 males in all. Playing and traveling spread out a bit then coming together. One female breached repeatedly, as well as one of the juveniles breached twice, once completely clearing the water. Some tail lobbing also observed. It was truly amazing as they kept appearing and coming in close as we bobbed along. An amazing sight! - Brittany Foxley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Oh, THERE the Residents are! Members of <b>all three pods </b>showed up on the west side (around <b>noon</b>)! Here's a huge breach from K20 Spock, one of three she did in a row. Many more photo highlights later including a whale with a fish and some K-Pod close-ups. Despite the drizzle it's been a great day at Lime Kiln! At 7:15 this morning 4 transients made their way north in Haro Strait, then from noon til 1:30 members of all three Resident pods went north, then south, some of them quite close to shore. - Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:43 - </b>OMG. And I dont say OMG that easily. Amazing pass just now- whales heading south close to shore (<b>Hannah Heights, ~5 miles south of Lime Kiln State Park</b>), rolling, mating, breaching, tail lobs--- water totally flat and their blows were like one of the best story board soundtracks on earth. WHAT A SATURDAY!!! - Sandy Buckley

My first glimpse of the water this morning including this tall dorsal fin in the distance! I thought at first it must be residents off of Lime Kiln, but instead it was a family group of <b>transients making their way north in Haro Strait</b>. I was out there for a few hours while the sunshine faded to rain, but no more orcas came by. - Monika Wieland

One of the best Fourth of July's ever! Got to spend some time with<b> K Pod (along with some J's) </b>on the<b> west side of San Juan Island</b>. These guys were spread out intermittently, doing what they do best: fishing for Chinook Salmon! The Chinook Salmon is what these whales prefer to eat, they're actually rather picky. They eat about 200-400 lbs of it per day depending on the size of the whale. The Chinook is the biggest of the salmonids out here, and is very rich in omega-3 fats. The salmon smell their way from the Pacific ocean up to their natal stream-bed. There must finally be enough Chinook in this area for K Pod to make the roughly 80 mile swim into the Salish Sea from the Pacific Ocean. Who knows how long we'll have them here for, things aren't as they used to be with the salmon population, so I'll enjoy them while there here. Happy Fourth everyone. Feel free to share- for more information on the issues facing our salmon watch Salmon Confidential. - Heather MacIntyre
K26, Lobo, born in 1993. This big guy was on the move fishing today. However, he made sure to exercise his curiosity and cruise past us ever so slowly, leaving us with all with a feeling of peace and wonder. - Heather MacIntyre

<b>10:45 - K-Pod's back! </b>They returned on July 2, but my first chance to see them was this morning. Here's K12 Sequim off of Lime Kiln.<b> J-Pod group A </b>went north early this morning, between 9 and 9:30 part of K-Pod made it up to Lime Kiln this morning, flipped and went back south. - Monika Wieland

Orca behavior/communication. As <b>J and K pods crossed Haro Strait </b>yesterday they were in quiet resting pattern, swimming slowly in tight groups. As they approached San Juan Island, K pod matriarch K 12 Sequim (pronounced Squim for those not in WA), stopped and began slapping her tail forcefully. The others responded by becoming more active and spreading out into a hunting pattern as they entered the area frequented by the Chinook salmon that they feed on. I love watching the behavioral intricasies.

<b>J and K pods were intermingled</b> in quiet resting mode when we met them headed <b>across Haro Strait towards San Juan Island</b>. Identical scenario to last Saturday except last week it was J and L. Here K 26 Lobo on the left swims with a couple J girls. - James Gresham

<b>9:10 - loud echolocation!</b>
<br/><b>6:38am - Lime Kiln</b> started hearing faint <b>calls</b> over ship noise, now (6:55) loud calls. Selena posted hearing them as early as 5:17am. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<b>Gray Whale calf</b>. Apparently this<b> calf and its mother have been around between Lopez Island and Smith Island for a couple days</b>. Baby Grays are not something seen here. I'm sure they took a detour up Juan de Fuca Strait during the northward migration. Both the mother and calf were keeping a very low profile. Swimming just under the surface and barely showing themselves. The Transient Killer Whales in this area are not Gray Whale specialists and who knows if mom even knows about them. But to get this far the calf had to survive Monterey Bay Ca where it is a very different story. A very unexpected sighting. - James Gresham

<b>Orcas in south Haro strait</b> everywhere! I was out with Puget Sound Express and <b>J pod as well as K pod</b> were having fun, eating, and moving incredibly fast. We saw them from <b>11:15 to 12:45</b>. It was a sight to behold, as it always is. - Dianne Dee Iverson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 - </b>Word from CWR is that <b>Js and Ks</b> are headed down <b>San Juan Island</b> and are probably around Eagle Point by now, and the<b> L pod members</b> are heading back out to sea somewhere near<b> Race Rocks</b>.

The <b>orcas</b> were very spaced out, but we continued to motor north with them to <b>Turn Point on Stuart Island</b>. The group we were lucky enough to see were the <b>J-16s and the J-22s</b>. The J-16s are composed of Slick (J-16), Mike (J-26), Allki (J-36), and Echo (J-42). The J-22s are the famous "cookie clan", composed of Oreo (J-32), Doublestuff (J-34), Cookie (J-38), and Rhapsody (J-32). - Aimee, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching

It took <b>K Pod </b>a while to return to the <b>San Juan Island</b>, but they finally came home and surprised us all early morning! When I first got on scene around <b>11:00</b> I didn't know what was happening! There's so many dorsal fins- this isn't just one pod, I kept thinking. I started doing the math and narrowing down individual whales. It wasn't until I saw <b>K21, Cappuccino</b>, with his distinct dorsal fin and saddle that I finally made the call- <b>K Pod was definitely here</b>. The day Islanders, whale fanatics, naturalists, etc have been waiting for this spring- summer: our first super-pod of the year! Members of all three pods were intermingled throughout the strait up the west side. However, as they started to go north, they all entered into a resting pattern and split up into smaller family pods. When I left them later that day, K Pod was slowly swimming up Swanson's Channel. What an exciting day! Everyone in K Pod was accounted for, but no new calves. I can't wait to get back out there tomorrow ... - Heather MacIntyre

K POD IS BACK! Yesterday I zoomed out to the lighthouse because I had received word the orcas were moving north in that direction. When I scrambled out onto the rocks and looked south I could see blows everywhere. Some were a bit far out, there was lots of activity and some of the blows were way inshore! I thought to myself, "This is going to be good!" As the first group of orcas began to pass, this handsome fellow popped up. I had to re-check my camera screen to make sure I wasn't making a mistaken ID, but sure enough, it was <b>K26 Lobo! K POD IS HERE!</b> It was a steady parade of exuberant orcas for about 25 minutes and members of all three pods were present (we are still missing a couple of families in L pod - one of which has not made an appearance yet this summer). Really exciting stuff and I can't wait to see what today brings. - Katie Jones

Surprise, surprise - <b>Southern Residents seen from the Anacortes/Sidney ferry</b>! Excited passengers headed for the outer decks as the ferry slowed down around <b>4:20 pm in north Haro Strait/east of Sidney Island</b>, where Southern Residents frolicked, porpoised and spy-hopped among the white-caps. What an unexpected treat for everyone on yet another beautiful summer's day. - Sandra Pollard

<b>J pod went north we heard with some of K and/or </b>L. Some members of K and L were headed south <b>along SJI</b>. We left them north of <b>False Bay about 7:15</b>. Very spread out with lots of foraging. And yes, choppy seas! - Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 PM - 14-16 </b>traveling E to W in choppy seas. <b>SW side of North Pender Island</b>. First group of 3-4 was approximately 200 yards out, second group (8-10) was parallel to our shore line about 50 yards out. Lost sight of the final group (3-4), 300 yds east of our location but they popped up in the kelp beds 10 yards from our deck. Moving quickly with long dives and only short breaks to fish and play.They popped up within 10 yards of our shoreline in the kelp beds. - Ken Plato

I sat out and watched from Land Bank tonight as the <b>orcas went South past Land Bank</b>...  Spread out up and down, as well as way far out to the middle of the straight. Center for Whale Research was out, and upon looking at my photos, Ken was onboard! So they were much closer then I, so I bet they know who was who having a little Hanky Panky....  Lots of rolling around...  upside down... pectorals in the air... waving tails...  I do believe I was blushing...  should not have been watching!  :-) - Cher Renke
