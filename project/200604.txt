<h3><center>April 2006 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>April 30, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Scott Ziegler sent us some <b>Gray </b>whale photos taken in Possession Sound at roughly <b>3:00 PM</b>, with Everett in the background. We'll be posting these on our website Sightings page soon - 
<br/>*<br/>
Fourth <b>Gray </b>Whale sighting of the day at <b>8:00 pm</b>. I wondered if it was the same whale that had been sighted and reported at 3:30 pm between the Sekiu River and Chito Point, as it was in the same general area.
<br/>Pat Ness, Chito Beach
<br/>Seven Miles West of Sekiu
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>1 PM</b>, we saw <b>J-Pod</b> foraging in a zig-zag pattern in a Southwesterly direction near Middle Bank. Soon a small group that we think included J22 Oreo and her two calves Doublestuff and Cookie began to get quite active. It must have been contagious as we saw 3-4 breaches, dozens of tail and pectoral percussives, tail lobs, cartwheels, and 7 spy hops! Everyone (this naturalist included) were quite excited to get to see almost every behavior we could in such a short period. Later we heard that J's had turned towards San Juan Island, and were spotted heading north past the Land Bank property towards Lime Kiln.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Marine Naturalist, Western Prince
<br/>*<br/>
Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to repot <b>J pod</b> today - they had headed north up the west side of San Juan Island, &amp; at <b>6 pm</b> were at Henry Island, where they turned &amp; headed south back down the west side of San Juan Isl. They were in 2 groups, not too spread out, &amp; the sprouters were getting frisky!
<br/>*<br/>
Hung out with <b>J Pod</b> in the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon; they were a bit west of Hein Bank at around <b>1pm</b>. Lots of breaching, tail-lobbing, cartwheeling and spyhopping. I'll send a lo-res your way once I get my pictures processed...
<br/>Erick Peirson
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at <b>1:15 pm</b> to report 2 <b>grays </b>off the east end of Gedney/Hat Island, heading toward Everett, ID'd as #49 (Patch) &amp; #22. He called back to say there were 4 (#53 &amp; #44), then a bit later called again to report 2 more whales (#383 &amp; #723)! close to Clinton heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island.
<br/>*<br/>
First sighting at <b>11:00 am</b> between Shipwreck Point and Chito Point, gray whale heading west, moving right along. Second <b>gray </b>slowly feeding and spy hopping - 1:30 pm at Chito Point, slowly circling and heading west.  3:30 pm - third gray between Sekiu River and Chito Point.
<br/>Pat Ness
<br/>Seven Miles west of Sekiu
<br/>*<br/>
Jill Hein of Coupeville called at <b>9:15 am</b> to report a <b>gray </b>whale off the ferry, 3/4 mile west of Mukilteo, heading south. 
<br/>*<br/>
Karen and I were standing on the jetty at the mouth of Grays Harbor this morning. One or two <b>gray </b>whales were feeding about 200 yards off the jetty. They were spouting away in the sunshine.

<b>April 29, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
During a trip West to Swartz Bay on BC ferries ,we had a PA announcement that there was a pod of <b>Orcas </b>off of North Pender Island. The Ferry had just gone through Active Pass, however I can not confirm the sighting myself.........
<br/>Colin
<br/>Calgary, Canada
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 3 <b>grays </b>south of Possession Pt. at <b>12:45 pm</b> - one of them was ID'd as # 53.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 28, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Did not expect <b>Jpod </b>until tomorrow but they came in late this afternoon.
I left them milling at <b>1745 </b>about 4miles North of Race Rocks.
<br/>Ron L. Bates, MMRG
<br/>Victoria.
<br/>*<br/>
We saw what we are sure was an "active" group of <b>porpi </b>between baby island and the green buoy (Saratoga Psg, near entrance to Holmes Hbr) this <b>morn</b>...
<br/>wayne and lynn flaaten
<br/>greenbank
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen called at <b>1:45 pm</b> to report 2 <b>grays </b>off Camano Head, going back &amp; forth.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>I saw two fins going south from Seahurst park (Burien) at about <b>630am</b>. They only came to the surface eight times or so, and then were out of view.  Too far away to see much detail.
<br/>Kathy Hansen
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>Gray </b>whale has been circling while feeding and spy-hopping this afternoon between <b>2 &amp; 4 pm</b> between Chito Beach and the Sekiu River (Seven Miles west of Sekiu), eventually heading west.
<br/>Pat Ness
<br/>*<br/>
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called at approx. <b>2:10 pm</b> to report 3 <b>gray </b>whales 1 mile east &amp; 1/2 mile north of the Clinton Ferry dock, heading in toward the beach &amp; zig zagging back &amp; forth. Also saw porpoise, seals &amp; sea lions today. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters had 2 <b>grays </b>closer to the Mukilteo side. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Jpod </b>in small groups but close together 8.5 miles South of Discovery going very slowly to the South West no sign of J1 and J2, time was <b>1445</b>.
<br/>Ron L. Bates, MMRG
<br/>Victoria  BC
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reported 2 <b>grays </b>at <b>1:30 pm</b> south of the Clinton/Mukiltdo Ferry, headed north toward Hat/Gedney Island. The whales were #53 &amp; #723.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 25, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
I saw <b>orcas </b>today. At <b>645pm</b>, I saw a group of 3-4 orcas, by binoculars, from my house on a bluff by Seahurst park in Burien. I watched them travel north toward Brace point, and then they seemed to be milling about very close to a group of birds. 30 minutes later I saw two of them headed south toward Three Tree point.
<br/>Kathy Hansen
<br/>*<br/>
We saw four <b>grays </b>around <b>11am</b>. They were in pairs. One pair S of Hat I and one pair SE of Hat (or Gedney Isl.)

<br/><br/>
My husband Paul and I were taking our boat up north to Everett and had the wonderful luck to watch 2 gorgeous <b>gray </b>whales in between the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry path. We watched them from <b>6:00-6:15pm</b>. Lots of backs, blows, and flukes.
<br/>Laurie &amp; Paul Harris
<br/>Edmonds
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>2:30 PM</b>, I noticed a small group of <b>orcas </b>swimming near Lime Kiln. I'll assume they were J-Pod, as I had to keep my eyes more on the road than on the water. 2 hours later, they were just coming up to Kellett Bluff, heading slowly north. Looked like a leisurely pace.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Shorebound Marine Naturalist, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We watched <b>J pod</b> go north up the west side of the island from about <b>1 p.m. to 4 p.m</b>. None were too close to shore, and most were about a quarter to a half mile out. Initially, they were spread out from Pile Point to Andrews Bay, foraging, milling, and playing a little.  J1 (Ruffles) and J2 (Granny) were among the lead whales. J30 did a little show as he went by LandBank. At one point he came up with a fish in his mouth and kelp wrapped around him as he played at the surface, before heading on to Lime Kiln. The stragglers became a large group at Andrews Bay--I'm not sure how that happened.  First there were 4 or 5, including the two youngest calves, then more and more of the pod joined up.  Some of them must have circled back, or something. At about 4 pm this group was passing Andrews Bay, still going north.

<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Martin in Seiku reported a really large <b>gray </b>whale in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, just east of Snow Creek heading east toward Chito Beach.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:45 AM</b> - Whales (<b>orcas</b>) are off Victoria B.C. traveling toward San Juan Island. 
<br/>Captain Jim Maya, Maya's Whale Watch 
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I was just watching the many flocks of birds skimming up Saratoga Passage and a huge <b>Gray </b>surfaced, then dove, flukes high in the air at <b>~6 am</b>. It put on quite a show out about mid-channel from here for about 10 minutes. I could tell it wasn’t Patch, but I don’t know the others well enough to guess who it might be. Then it turned and headed straight for us (East Pt). It’s down below right now, probably having a great shrimp breakfast.
<br/>Windwalker, East Pt.
<br/>Whidbey Island
<br/><br/>
<b>April 23, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Walking west on the Langley beach tonight <b>near sunset</b> came upon two <b>greys </b>diving in the little bay, lingering there for several blows then heading East along the shore as we walked back east toward town. Some flukes, then a steady swim over to Camano.
<br/>Heather Ogilvy
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
I saw patch and another <b>gray </b>whale at the entrance to Holmes Harbor (I was in a boat). The timing was probably around <b>4:30 or so</b>. Am sure they're the same two who passed by my house (when I wasn't home) and continued on by Race Lagoon, as reported by Bruce Bardwell.
<br/>Jill Hein  
<br/>Coupeville
<br/>*<br/>
I heard <b>orca </b>calls on hydrophone <b>from 0345 to 0530</b>.
<br/>Ken Balcomb, Senior Scientist
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We took a walk on Hidden Beach/North Bluff north of Greenbank &amp; watched a <b>gray </b>spouting near Camano Island State Park, heading south past Elger Bay from approx. <b>4:15 - 4:30</b>.
<br/>Susan &amp; Howie, Orca Network
<br/>Greenbank
<br/>*<br/>
I saw 2 <b>grays </b>off our beach at Race Lagoon heading south at <b>2:35 PM</b>. They were heading slowly. 
<br/>Bruce Bardwell 
<br/>*<br/>
We were out near Hein Bank around <b>2:30pm</b> and found 4 <b>orcas </b>'playing' with a Dall's porpoise. I am not sure who we were looking at but there was definitely a sprouting male and a female with a calf. The 'show' lasted about 10-15min and involved lots of rolling around and quick surfaces.
<br/>Jenny Linton
<br/>Victoria, BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:10 PM - J Pod</b>  about 5 miles off South Beach. 
<br/>Maya's Whale Watch Charters
<br/>*<br/>
The call came in that <b>Orcas </b>were at Hein Bank heading South (towards Sequim). 4 miles south of Hein bank we spotted first one, then several orcas.  First was J8 Speiden (still easily ID'd by her inhale). Then J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J26 Mike, J27 Blackberry (who was "babysitting" J39 Mako)!  We also saw a minke whale off in the distance, as well as Dall's and Harbor Porpoises.
<br/>John Boyd (JB) Marine Naturalist, Western Prince
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
At Hein Bank, we encountered <b>Jpod</b>, looking to be foraging and milling about - spread out over severals miles. Clearly id'd Ruffles J1 - so glad to see him back this season, I read he had been seen already but there is nothing like spotting that magnifient animal in person!
<br/>Ellen@Richmond 
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called in a report of 2 <b>gray </b>whales between Mukilteo &amp; Edmonds, heading north at approx. <b>1 pm</b> - they were ID'd as #22 &amp; #383.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:00 pm</b>. Saw a <b>gray </b>whale due east of the Possession Pt green buoy, north of the shipwreck. Heading north. Followed closely, around 100 meters or less by a tour boat. 
<br/>*<br/>
We watched two <b>grays </b>this morning off the north end of Camano. We watched them from our place on Polnell Hts (Whidbey) for about and hour around <b>10am</b>.
<br/>Warren
<br/>Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:30 to noon</b>, and still within sight: 5 <b>grays</b>: 2 groups of 2 and 1 solo. Spread out over a very wide area (about a mile).  All about 1 1/2 miles off shore (due south of Cultus Bay). One pair clearly travelling east. The other 3 pretty stationary for now.   
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton, Whidbey Island  
<br/><br/>
<b>April 22, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
approx <b>5PM</b>:  two <b>grays </b>travelling in an easterly direction, about two miles off shore, due south of Cultus Bay. What intially caught our eye were some very large splashes--may have been a couple of breeches or some tail lobbing, but by the time we grabbed the binoculars, they were just travelling along at a liesurely pace.
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call at <b>10:15 pm</b>, from a young man who reported he was watching an <b>orca </b>from the Crab Shack in Florence, OR (just east of the hwy 101 bridge over the Suislaw River), chasing seals up the river.  
<br/>*<br/>
Dennis Burns of Edmonds called at <b>7:40 pm</b> to report 2 [<b>gray] </b>whale blows, 1 small, off Scatchet Head, moving toward Possession Pt, SW Whidbey Island.
<br/>*<br/>
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called at <b>7:30 pm</b> to report a couple of <b>gray </b>whales in Saratoga Passage, north of Camano Isl. State Park, active &amp; jumping, heading north with no boats around.
<br/>*<br/>
Chris Rose of Greenbank called at <b>6 pm</b> to report 2 <b>gray </b>whales feeding off North Bluff Rd, slowly heading north toward our place.
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reported 2 <b>gray </b>whales - #21 &amp; #383, east of Gedney/Hat Island at <b>2:25 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Looked out towards Langley about <b>9 AM</b> and saw two <b>grays </b>diving and spouting in unison. After a  
period of time, the 2 whales finally appeared some distance off the stern of the boat.
<br/>Barbara Brock
<br/>Camano Island
<br/><br/>
<b>April 21, 2006</b>
<br/><br/> 
Received an interesting call from Craig, who runs a charter boat out of Emeryville, CA - on 4/21 they were out fishing for squid when they saw ~20 <b>orcas </b>attacking squid, with several calves. They were near the Half Moon Bay weather buoy. He got video footage of this &amp; will be sending it to Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research....should be interesting!!
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 2 <b>grays </b>at Camano Hd. at <b>2 pm</b>, heading north to Mabana, ID'd as #49 (Patch) &amp; #21.
<br/>*<br/>
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called to report 2 <b>gray </b>whales north of Camano Island State Park at <b>1 pm</b>, very active, heading north.
<br/>*<br/>
Received a call reporting [<b>gray</b>] whales off the west side of Camano at <b>2 pm</b>, north of the point. 
<br/>*<br/>
From southern Camano, we saw two <b>grey </b>whales moving slowly towards Pebble Beach near Mabana. We hurried to the beach, in time to witness the whales' thrilling blows only 50 feet away (they have bad breath).  This is the second time we have seen them feeding there, the last time two weeks ago. Later in the afternoon around 5, we also saw whales, number unknown, out in the middle of Saratoga Passage, moving quickly north east of Langley. There were perhaps four, from what we determined at the distance we were watching from.
<br/>Peg Boley
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/> 
One(possibly 2) <b>grays </b>mid channel off Langley, feeding deep and staying pretty much in the same area, <b>3:30 pm</b>. <b>Five PM</b> - Two grays (Mom &amp; baby?) feeding along the Camano shore, just south of Mabana. Low tide also reveals a few  
"whale holes" on our beach. 
<br/>Barbara Brock, Mabana
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
We've been watching two <b>gray's </b>traveling together over the past few days cruising in Saratoga Passage near Indian Beach and feeding near the shore. Sometimes Northbound, sometimes Southbound. Both seem to be young.  The last sighting was today at about <b>2pm</b>.
<br/>Ivan Cross
<br/>Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called in a report of 2 <b>grays </b>(#49/Patch, &amp; #21) at Camano Head, traveling north toward Mabana Beach at <b>2 pm</b>. He said Island Adventures was with 3 grays off Onamac Pt, Camano Island, those whales were heading north at a fast pace, one possibly heading toward Penn Cove.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Here's a great report from Tongue Pt [<i>near Port Angeles</i>] this <b>morning </b>from gary korb, a Joyce resident and kayak surfer...sent in by Rob Casey:
All of a sudden this 6 foot high spear juts up out of the oncoming swell. It's a male <b>Orca </b>fin just ripping along about 100 feet away. There were only 2 of them a male and female, this means they are hunting for seals. They stayed around for about 10 minutes before heading east.
<br/>Happy surfing.........Gary
<br/>*<br/>
One or two <b>grays </b>traveling, again, in an easterly direction, sited to the south of the Clinton ferry dock as the <b>10AM </b>ferry took off. One whale was particularly large--the largest gray I have ever seen off Whidbey. They were actually too far out to positively identify as grays--so there is always a chance that they were not. 
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton, Whidbey Island
<br/><br/>
<b>April 19, 2006</b>
<br/><br/> 
The Gray that has been hanging out in Agate Passage lazed around all evening - about halfway between the Agate Pass Bridge and the Suquamish Pier. It has apparently been in the area for several days.
(<i>from information we've received, we believe this whale has been in that area since ~March 31 - sb</i>)
<br/>Jean Boyle, Director, Tourism Development 
<br/>Kitsap Peninsula Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau 
*<br/> 
Alan and I watched two (?) <b>Grays </b>feeding along the shore just west of Sandy Point in the Saratoga Passage. It was after the sun had set so we were only able to see tails and blows silhouetted on the water surface. Lots of blows so there may have been more than two.  
We could still hear them after we couldn't see them anymore.
<br/>Noel Goforth
<br/>Langley
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:30-7:30 PM</b>:  two <b>grays </b>feeding liesurely as they traveled in an easterly direction, past Langley's waterfront park--very close into shore (at high tide)--about 50 feet out!
<br/>Deborah Houseworth
<br/>Clinton, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:15- 7:45 PM</b>, 2 [<b>gray</b>] whales feeding on the ghost shrimp in front of Langley heading east. 
<br/>Veronica von Allworden
<br/>Langley, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Reporting <b>gray </b>whales sightings from seven miles west of Sekiu, slowing feeding in circles between Sekiu River and Chito Beach at <b>6:00 p.m</b>.
<br/>Pat Ness
<br/>Sekiu
<br/>*<br/>

<b>J pod</b> arrived off the west side. I watched them going south from Lime Kiln to Landbank to Hannah Heights from <b>11:30 a.m</b>. to about 1:30 p.m. Lots of foraging going on. A whale that looked suspiciously like J2 (Granny) was leading the inshore orcas, followed by a whale that looked suspiciously like J8 (Spieden). J19 and J41 were definitely inshore while I was watching. J41 seems to have grown a lot and was expending much energy bouncing off J19's blowhole, or tail-slapping her as she attempted to forage. That little whale seems quite healthy. J17, J26 and J27 were also inshore, as were about 15 members of  the pod. J1 was out in the middle of Haro Strait with about 5 others, and was attracting lots of attention from whale watch boats. After passing Pile Point, the inshore orcas headed off shore towards Salmon and Hein Bank. Unfortunately, by 5 p.m. J1 was pretty far west, according to the position of the whale watch boats. Hope J pod doesn't go back out.

I've just returned from Hidden Beach off of North Bluff Road on Whidbey Island. I had the great pleasure to observe 2 <b>Grey </b>Whales feeding close to shore, and one further off, from about <b>9:30 to 10:30 a.m</b>. They spent most of the time feeding on the ghost shrimp beds, on their sides, plowing through the bottom with the downside fluke propelled by their tails which were swishing around vigorously.  Then they would seem to pause, with the upside fin dropping slowly. The lateral portion of their torso would be exposed frequently, as the water did not seem to be too deep. At about 10:30, the two I had been watching along the shore moved off towards the center of Saratoga Passage.

We got a call from a friend that lives on Sandy Hook, south of the agate pass bridge (Kitsap County). She said a <b>gray </b>whale had been hanging out in front of her house for about 24 hours. We went to see it. It was only about 50 feet offshore, rolling around and bobbing up and down. Occasionally it would go under for longer amounts of time, but mostly for about an hour it was hanging out kind of slowly swimming back and forth and hanging around. I do not know what feeding behavior is but it seemed very relaxed and calm. Then it resurfaced and headed over towards Battlepoint on Bainbridge Island and then swam so towards Brownsville. I understand from another person that was down at the shore that the whale had been hanging out in this area for about a week.

Just as we were pulling into Penn Cove around 4 pm, we got a call from Island Adventures, relaying an unconfirmed report of orcas off Partridge Pt (on the west side of Whidbey).

So we watched from the point until 5:30 pm in the pouring rain - it looked like 4 - 6 transients, making several kills, traveling back &amp; forth not far offshore.

Then we left them south bound in the middle of Saratoga Passage doing side by side simultaneous flukeing complete with several double flukes. We remained at least 150 yards at all times, much farther than the 30 to 50 feet the beachwatchers and dogs were maintaining. The second surprise found us between Camano Head, Hat Island and Sandy Point at about <b>13:15</b> with the same set of Grays, still southbound and entering building seas. This time they fascinated me and my private clients with several (7 for sure) breaches of an adult Gray. These were not lunge feeds.

Southern Residents were making their way up the coast offshore; We found about a dozen members of <b>L pod</b> just a few miles north of Westport at <b>8:30</b> AM. ID photos have been sent out for confirmation of who all was there. We were on one of our 120nm surveys of the outer coast, which we try to do once or twice a month. In addition we sighted 4 or 5 migrating <b>gray </b>whales, and a tight group of about 5 harbor porpoise in association with a tiderip that had accumulated some floating debris.

Windwalker Taibi called at <b>2:20 pm</b> to report 2 or 3 <b>grays </b>mid-channel between East Pt. &amp; Camano. Lots of fluking, spouting &amp; action for the nearby Island Explorer, the Capt. was keeping his distance from the whales.
<br/>*<br/>
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called to report 2 to 4 <b>grays </b>mid-Saratoga Passage between East Pt. &amp; Camano Island at <b>1:10 pm</b>, doing deep dives.

At <b>10:30 AM</b> we say a <b>grey</b> whale near Clinton at  Brighton Beach going south at  about 100 yards off shore. He was shallow diving then blowing every few minutes for about 5 times while we could see, so we assumed he was feeding in the area.

<b>6:50 Pm</b> - There are two or maybe three <b>gray </b>whales mid channel between Langley and Camano heading east.

We saw our first thrilling sight of three <b>grey </b>whales feeding and traveling off Pebble Beach in Saratoga Passage, on the west side of the island and east of Langley on Whidbey Island. There were three of them, feeding in very shallow water just 80 feet from the water's edge. They swam back and forth, feeding on the ghost shrimp in the sand. They had approached from the middle of the Saratoga Passage towards us, fed, then swam back into the middle of the channel and headed slowly south. They approached the beach, again very close, just SE of the Wilkes Gary beach. The time of day was at low tide, around <b>5:00 pm</b>, and they swam in the area until about <b>7:00 pm</b>.

<b>2:00 PM</b> - We are watching 4 <b>gray </b>whales feeding off shore at Elger Bay, Saratoga Passage, Camano Island. They are currently in the bay.  We have not determined which way they may be heading. We are on the bluff above Elger Bay and could not see any markings.
They were here last year in the same area for several days.

We just spotted a pod off about 15 <b>orca </b>2-3 miles off Copalis. There were two mature males and at least one calf. They were close together (meters), surfacing in rapid succession. It appeared they might have been the same pod we spotted in the area last year around this time. Unfortunately, they did not come close enough to photograph. We're planning to go out tomorrow from Westport for fish tracking acoustics and will have time to look for them again.

We just spotted a <b>gray </b>whale off Langley, WA at <b>11:00 a.m</b>. I was standing approx, across from the police station on Front Street and noticed a disturbance in the water that was not waves maybe only 100 yds off the breakwall.
And there he/she was. He surfaced and we could see his entire body gliding along south toward the marina and Sandy Point. We could see him and hear him blow and also as he glided he would lift his tail to "wave" at us. We followed him to the marina where he had moved out to mid channel. He continued to move swiftly south and the last we saw of him from the marina dock was mid channel in the deep water south of Gedney Island....several more blows and tail waves.

No foolin'... the very FIRST thing I saw when I opened my eyes at about 7am and looked out our window was the back of a huge gray whale breaking the surface of Saratoga Passage down at the bottom of Park Ave in Langley. And, oh boy, was the rain ever hammering down too.  There he lurked for quite some time feeding on the bottom. Then he, or one of his cousins, returned to the very same spot about two hours later, around 9ish.
