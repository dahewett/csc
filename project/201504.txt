April 30, 2015: On the morning of the last update (<b>24 April</b>) <b>L84 and likely at least a few other L pod members</b> were headed north off the <b>Long Beach Peninsula</b>, in southwest Washington. By the morning of the <b>25th</b> they were off the <b>entrance to Grays Harbor</b> where they remained through the 26th. By the <b>27th</b> they were headed south, off the entrance to <b>Willipa Bay</b> in the morning and off <b>Cape Disappointment</b> by that afternoon. They made a loop back to the north off the Long Beach Peninsula on the 28th but by the morning of the 29th they were off Nestucca Bay, in northern Oregon. They reversed direction and
headed north such that by the morning of the 30th they were off the entrance to the Columbia River and the entrance to Willipa Bay by that afternoon.

<b>9:00 am -</b> Greetings, I saw your poster on the PT ferry. <b>Orcas off of Point Hudson at Port Townsend</b>. -Bob Garrison

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:00 pm -</b> Markus and I went for a walk and randomly saw whales! Here is a photo of a <b>J pod</b> mum and calf swimming past the <b>Oak Bay (Victoria, BC)</b> golf course. Prior to that, we watched a number of killer whales traveling east bound in the Juan de Fuca strait from the Victoria shoreline. Spyhops, pec slapping, tail slapping, was observed. -Maria Chantelle Tucker.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
We encountered all of <b>J pod near William Head</b> traveling east towards Victoria waterfront this <b>afternoon</b>! -Andrew Lees
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3 J Pod babies just off Sooke BC</b>, off Otter Point this morning about <b>10:30/11 am</b>! Captain Paul from Sooke Coastal Explorations had a hunch that Jpod would be coming in front of Sooke. Wendy Cooke Lang and I went with Paul to see. It wasn't far until Wendy spotted at least 7 blows. Paul counted <b>about 20 whales</b>. -Deanna Brett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:00 pm - J-Pod headed NE past Metchosin towards Victoria</b>... Watching from shore. They're pretty far out there but the big dorsal fins are easy to see! They're clipping along at a fast pace; about four commercial whale-watch vessels in the surrounding area. 11:34 am - <b>J-Pod swimming east past Sooke Point</b> right now! -Michelle Rachel  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>	
	
April 30 <b>L84</b> was just to north of the entrance to<b> Grays Harbor</b>, but well offshore, on our previous update (20 April). The whales moved inshore that afternoon, to just off the entrace to Grays Harbor, but by the morning of the 21st they had traveled due west and were on the shelf break. They headed north/northeast and were just north of Cape Elizabeth on the morning of the 22nd. From there they traveled south and by the <b>morning of the 23rd were near the entrance to the Columbia River</b>. They remained in this  general area overnight and as of this morning (24 April) they were just  north of Cape Disappointment.

<b>10:35 am - Orcas 1 mile north of McCurdy Point</b> (Port Townsend) heading west. -Christopher Hanke

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:57am -</b> now they're heading northwest across the bay towards the San Juans. 
<br/><b>9:54 am - </b>They are right off <b>Point Wilson</b> right now. Look to be feeding just outside current. I see at least one large adult and possibly two small ones. So far have only seen three dorsels at once. 
<br/><b>9:16 am - Off Fort Worden, Port Townsend Marine Science Center. 
<br/>9:07 am - Orca pod off Port Townsend</b> right now. Just rounded point Hudson heading toward Point Wilson. -Rebecca Samuelson 

<br/><br/>

<br/>

With the <b>T124 matriline</b>. We definitely covered some water yesterday,  leaving these orcas at <b>Salamanca Point</b> (Galiano Island, southwest Georgia St.). -Heather McIntyre, Legacy Charters, 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We headed out at <b>1:30pm and encountered TO49c near Becher Bay (west of Victoria) heading East</b>. Whilst we watched <b>TO49c</b>, he continued to travel east towards <b>Race Rock</b>s. He did enter the park and the three WW boats stayed outside the park as he hunted and traveled along the main channel. Eventually he exited the park close by the Sea Lions and continued East. The final boat left TO49c heading for the VH marker. -Andrew Lees  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:00 pm - Two orcas in front of Westbay Marina</b> (Olympia). -John Glacken  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:48 am - 2 Greys </b>50-60 yards off the beach. Cleaning and feeding. Traveling into <b>Tulalip Bay</b>. -Christopher Klaschik

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>8:02 pm - </b>A <b>small group of whales</b> just turned up west sound on <b>Orcas Island</b>. -Brian Schmitz 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

So, we are watching the<b> humpback, Big Mama, just south of Patos Island</b>. One of the passengers asked about Orcas. I told her that some had been sighted earlier in the morning near here, but no one had seen them since. I also mentioned that they could pop up any time and BOOM! THERE THEY WERE, <b>Ts</b> HEADED TOWARD US AND BIG MAMA! Squeals of laughter and delight! We followed the <b>T36As, T49Bs past Patos Island as they headed toward East Point, Saturna Island, BC</b>. Pics of mine from aboard the Peregrine, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. -James Mead Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:35 am -</b> Very active <b>orcas east of Sucia island</b>, seen through binoculars out of Echo Bay. <b>5-12 individuals </b>although difficult to see as they were staying close together. Traveling slowly northbound. -Jennifer Smith 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today we found<b> two humpback whales near East Point, Saturna Island</b>. One of the whales was a large female named <b>Big Mama</b> and the other was a younger, smaller animal (later <b>ID'd as "Windy"</b>). We watched them zig zag back and forth near the shallows of <b>Boiling Reef </b>and I couldn't resist snapping a shot with a humpback tale, the<b> Patos Island Lighthouse, and Mt. Baker in the background</b>. It was just too good to pass up. After this happened, the whales surprised us with a closer look. I will say this - It's not every day I have to go home and shower because I have whale snot all over me. And as a side note: humpbacks decidedly do not smell good. -Katie Jones 

<br/><br/>

<br/>

Some shots from today's encounter with the<b> T36A's and T49B's near Salmon Bank</b>! Another sweet day out there! -Gary Sutton	
	
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Lovely day with <b>T49Bs and T36s, south of South Beach, San Juan Island</b>. -James Mead Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transients seen off the west side of San Juan Island</b> from the Odyssey,  San Juan Excursions whale watching boat out of Friday Harbor. -Carol Allen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
We watched the <b>T036A's and T049B's</b> take out a Harbour porpoise <b>south of Discovery Island</b> in the morning. They got another one at mid day north of <b>Middle Bank</b>. They continued traveling east along the <b>west side of San Juan Island past Eagle Point</b> and then jagged out to Hein Bank before continuing east to <b>Rosario Strait</b>. -Mark Malleson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Today was awesome! Another beautiful day on the water. Sooke Whale Watching was going out on an adventure, so I jumped on for a ride! <b>Transient Killer Whales off Victoria</b>. -Deanna Brett  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:30-1:00 pm -</b> I saw <b>2 -3 Orcas between Bowen Island and Worlcombe Island</b> (appr. 8 miles NW of Vancouver BC). They travelled quickly on the south side of Bowen passing Cape Roger Curtis. Looked like a large male and 2 smaller orca. They were spotted again near Deep Bay on Bowen around 3:00 pm and were headed north. Sorry no photos. Was a magical few minutes to see them. -Dianne Felsmann 	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:00 pm -</b> My wife, Erika, and I saw <b>a male orca swimming just south of Point of the Arches around the southern tip of Shi Shi beach</b> (very northern end of Olympic National Park, south of the Makah Indian Reservation.) We had just walked through one of the smaller set of arches south of the point when we saw the huge, 6-foot dorsal fin emerge three times for surface breaths while swimming steadily southeast through the seastacks toward Ozette. It did not linger, and we did not see any other dorsals or sign of other orcas. The sighting was not long enough to take any photos, but it was a truly amazing, thrilling experience. We have seen the superpod in the San Juans, but this unexpected glimpse at a wilderness beach was magnificent. Time was approximately 1 p.m. ...he was swimming steadily, three surface breaths at regular five-to-10-second intervals. That weekend we observed many seals sunning on the numerous rocks and seastacks in this area, and we saw a few swimming, too. We assume the orca was a transient, only because we saw no other orcas, but we have no way of knowing. The very tall dorsal left no doubt it was a male, and we saw a fair amount of the body emerge during each breath -- he was a big guy. Once he disappeared behind a nearby seastack, we never got another glimpse. Sight angles are tight at that spot, a lot of obstructions. But the orca passed us fairly close to the arches where we were -- we did not need binoculars at all. -Scott Morris

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We have seen <b>two grays</b> much of the <b>afternoon</b>-they seem to be making big circles around <b>Possession Sound</b>. We watched them feeding on the flats and head toward Hat Island, then back toward the flats. We saw some great tail slaps today! My stepson (Michael Clark) got lots of photos (see below), and I will post some when we get back. My stepson smelled blow for the first time, too-LOL. Last we saw, they were heading in the<b> direction of Langley</b>. That was about<b> 4:30</b>. -Sharon Ann Clark 
	
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:55 pm -</b> from <b>Kayak County Park</b>...looking south see blows mid channel approx. <b>between Camano Head and Tulalip</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:05 pm -</b>We just saw at least <b>one gray whale on the flats near shadow of Pilchuk</b>. I think there are more than one-clearly feeding. We aren't close enough to get good photos-now they are moving north-at least two. My birthday is complete-just wish I had a telephoto lens... -Sharon Ann Clark

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:10 pm -</b> from Harborview Park (Everett) Ed and I see<b> gray whale off east side of Whidbey</b>, south of Sandy Point generally heading slowly southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:20am -</b> Slowly heading north east towards Everett and east side of Hat a island 
<br/><b>10:52am -</b> Hanging out with a <b>Gray Whale</b> on this beautiful morning. Currently between Clinton and Mukilteo right on the ferry route mid channel. -Stu Davidson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Gray Whale #53 "Little Patch"  Between Clinton and Mukilteo</b> right on the ferry route mid channel. -Stu Davidson

<br/>
<b>4:40pm - (Grays are at) Kayak Point Park</b> -Kristin Kreifels

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:38 pm -</b> Have seen whale watching boats the past three days in <b>Port Susan</b>, and watched while<b> several grey whales</b> spouted and surfaced from our vantage point above Sunny Shores! -Connie Johnson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:10 pm - </b>Just watched <b>three gray whales feeding off Camano Island</b>.  Including <b>#49 "patch" &amp; #383. #22 </b>was out there too! -Elyse Margaret

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Afternoon trip report - A 25th anniversary fundraising cruise today for Island County Beach Watchers - and what a great day for passengers, and whales! We headed towards Port Susan and immediately found<b> #22 and #383 </b>foraging along the shoreline with pectoral fins almost waving at us...another blow in the distance and we found <b>#49 Patch</b> heading towards <b>Kayak Point</b>, traveling with <b>#21</b>. Then yet another blow and we found <b>#53 Little Patch</b> in the middle of the bay!! Wow, 5 whales! We had time for a short re-visit with #22 and #383 before returning to port, it was so cool to see FIVE whales today, very happy passengers aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon</b> - we had the thrill of watching<b> two gray whales feeding off our beach at Port Susan Terrace on east Camano Island</b>. They were inside the buoy line and spent nearly an hour stirring up the bottom for their feast. Two whale watching boats shared the experience with us. This brought some questions to mind. How do the boat crews track the whales? And are there distance limitations for boats and gray whales,as there are with Orcas? We all love our whales. -Mary Pelland 

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>11:45 pm -</b> The magic of midnight on <b>Port Susan</b>: Still air, star filled sky, shimmering moonlight on a rippled sea, the silence of midnight broken by the blowing of <b>a grey whale</b>, eerily echoing off the bluff, swimming a stone's throw off the beach, headed for kayak point! Three blows and swim, Three blows and swim, fading into the night. -Doug Barlow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Five gray whales in Port Susan this morning</b>! Blue skies and sunshine soon replaced the early morning rain as Mystic Sea headed through calm water towards heart-shaped blows silhouetted against the skyline. Gray whales<b> #22, 44 (Dubknuck), 49 (Patch), 53 (Little Patch) and 723</b> welcomed us as they swam slowly southwards in unison, the only sound breaking the silence being the 'whoosh' of air from their blowholes. How lucky we are to have these gentle giants around Whidbey Island every year... Our afternoon trip to Port Susan brought forth fresh fruit in the form of<b> #383</b>, accompanied by a friend (possibly<b> #21</b>) feeding close to shore. Returning to Langley we spotted blows off Fox Spit in Saratoga Passage - so that's where Patch and his companions went! -Sandra Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
They came right up to the beach at <b>Kayak Point</b> this evening around <b>4:30</b>. So amazing watching them feed. -Jacqueline Slaughter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Two of the three grays feeding in Port Susan</b> near Warm Beach this morning. -Gary Lingenfelter

Capt. David Howitt, aboard his classic wooden  1956 42' pilot house sloop, the S/V Peniel,  with <b>humpback BCY0324 Big Mama, Boundary Pass, BC</b>. -Capt. James Mead Maya 	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpback whale BCY0324 aka "Big Momma" cartwheeling near Saturna Island BC</b>. -James Gresham 	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>BCY0324</b> caudal/peduncle (aka tail) throws. The whale lies upside down, lifts it's aft end high in the air and slams the flukes down. She did this repeatedly. A humpback's peduncle, the area in front of the tail flukes, contains the most powerful muscles in the animal world.  Strong enough to get a 60 ton animal airborne with 2-3 kicks of the tail. -James Gresham 	

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>J36 and J52 were west of Jordan River</b>. -Mark Malleson 	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
Thanks to Paul from Sooke Explorations for relaying a sighting of <b>killer whales off of Sheringham Pt.</b> we were able to catch up with the <b>J16's west of Jordan River</b>. They were moving quickly west out the Juan de Fuca Strait. No sign of the rest of Jpod but likely well ahead. -Mark Malleson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
	
Was out on an adventure with Sooke Coastal Whale Watching! We found <b>Jpod off of Sheringham Lighthouse </b>(Sooke, BC). There were 2 babies. One of them was jumping out of the water. It was way too fast to capture at the time. Towards the end of our visit with them I got a bit of footage of the wee one hanging with his momma! -Deanna Brett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

There are no fewer than<b> five grays in Port Susan today at Kayak Point</b>. One of them had a large patch of tan-colored barnacles on head. #21? -Gary Lingenfelter 
	
<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">April 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

We started off with gray skies and light rain, but that didn't deter our passengers or the whales! Heading south we found<b> #44 Dubknuck south-west of Hat Island </b>- heading towards the Clinton Ferry. He showed us his fluke (tail) several times as he continued on south. We then turned north towards Camano Island, and found 3 more whales near Port Susan. One was a bit elusive and we could not identify, but the other two were<b> #21 and #22</b>, traveling together southbound. We had some really good viewing of these two as they surfaced in tandem several times, and by the time we headed for Langley - the sun was out! A great day again aboard the Mystic Sea.  -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist. 

<br/><br/>

<br/>

It's always such a pleasure to get to spend time with <b>Jpod</b>...we got to see them around <b>False Bay on San Juan Island</b>. Conditions were a bit on the rough side but that never stops the magic when you are with these guys! It was my first chance to get a look at some of our wonderful new babies!!! -Ashley Keegan, Wild Whales Vancouver

One of the <b>J-pod calves</b> seen from Island Explorer 4. -Mark Connell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Some highlights from our trip with<b> J pod offshore of False Bay</b>. We had everyone except for the <b>J14's, J22's, J2 and L87</b> who must have been trailing behind. We spent some quality time with the "Jabies", which is always a treat! -Gary Sutton  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J34 and J27 </b>exiting <b>Middle Channel</b> (south end of Haro Strait) in the morning. -Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 pm - Three orcas </b>spotted at Inn of the Sea, <b>Yellow Point (Ladysmith, BC)</b>. We had over 20 seals near us and the whales came really close. Traveling maybe stopped for a short while to feed on a seal. They didn't stay long so not sure if they were feeding. There were two large ones and a smaller one. -Karen Green

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Greys</b> are back for a second night of feeding and cleaning. Just off the beach 100 yards. <b>Mission Beach, Tulalip WA</b>. -Christopher Klaschik

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Big air day!!! We witnessed another predation event, with the <b>65a's and the 75b's</b> hunting presumably a harbor porpoise at <b>Danger Shoal</b> (where Speiden Channel meets Haro Strait).

Orca watchers, here's you latest update on <b>tagged orca L84</b>. 20 April update - This past week marked the beginning of the third month of tracking L84. The whales continued to spend time <b>off the southwest Washington</b> and <b>northern Oregon coasts</b> during this time. As of the morning of the last update (14 April) the whales were approaching the area near the Columbia River. They turned north and by the morning of the 15th were between the entrances to Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay. From there, they turned south and by the morning of the 16th were off Tillamook Head. They then turned north that day and by the morning of the 18th were off the entrance to Grays Harbor, before turning south. On the morning of the 18th they were off Tillamook Bay, where they again turned north and were off the entrance to the Columbia River on the morning of the 19th. By this morning (20th) they were just to north of the entrance to Grays Harbor, but well offshore. Map photo courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC

Trip report: The summer-like weather continued, the seas were calm, and we found <b>two of our gray giants</b> feeding on the drop-off <b>between Hat (Gedney) Island and Everett</b>. <b>#383 </b>was the first whale we found, and soon<b> #22</b> joined him and they traveled together, feeding, and sometimes just logging on the surface. At one point they surfaced in tandem between us and another boat, wow, now that was a surprise, and such a treat to hear their powerful "blows". We scouted further afield looking for more whales but none were found before we needed to head back to Langley. What a great day for many passengers who had never seen whales before!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Stunning day on the water! I spent all day watching <b>J Pod in Haro Strait</b> today. Their behavior suggested that they were very serious about <b>foraging</b>, and were spread six miles at one point. The more time these orcas spend spread out, broken up into small family groups foraging, the less socializing they are able to do. Socializing is incredibly important for these whales, and often leads to breeding interaction. With a population hovering around just eighty orcas, they need to be breeding! We did get to see <b>all three of the new J Pod calves </b>and some social behavior towards the end of the day. J50 was as spunky as ever and spent much of her time with older sister, J42 Echo. This is the first time I've seen J42 Echo babysitting. What a special matriline the J16's are, but then, I'm a bit bias! Goodnight all you orca lovers! -Heather McIntyre

Today's benefit whale watch brought us to the <b>Snohomish delta</b> where we found gray whale<b> #383 </b>wearing a bright orange suction-cup and beloved Patch, <b>#49 </b>side-by-side. Soon veteran researcher John Calambokidis from Cascadia Research pulled up to the Mystic Sea in an inflatable boat from which he and his assistants had just attached the tag to the whale. John told us this was the last day of three days of tagging research, with two more days of photo-identification studies to follow. The tags yield a wide array of information about gray whale behavior underwater, from dive depth, duration, angles of descent and ascent, and feeding methods. Most exciting is that the tag includes a video camera to record the pit-feeding maneuvers to bring up ghost shrimp buried over a foot deep in the mud. More about the gray whale field studies can be found on the Cascadia Research Collective facebook page. We also found gray whale<b> #53</b> feeding on his side with a flipper and fluke tip waving in the air a few miles off the Tulalip Reservation.-Susan &amp; Howard, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:00-5:00pm -</b> It was a beautiful and sunny with lots of passengers on Orca Network's fundraising cruise this afternoon. We searched out the <b>gray whales close to Everett</b>, and learned that Cascadia Research had just tagged whale <b>#383</b> and Cascadia (John Calambokidis) stopped by the Mystic Sea to explain what they were doing. #383's tag/camera was quite visible, it would most likely have dropped off the whale by late this afternoon. Traveling with #383 was everybody's favorite #49 Patch! Had some great views of them both, then went off to find <b>#53</b> (sometimes known as "Little Patch") who was a little further south. All too quickly it was time to head back to port - it was an exciting and fun trip today aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>Northern Puget Sound gray whale update:</b> 19 April was our final day of suction cup tag deployments on gray whales and we successfully deployed <b>2 camera tags</b> on whales. The first was brief when a 2nd whale knocked the tag off the whale within the first few minutes which damaged the fragile flotation on this tag and took it out of action though this did show the level social contact and interaction among these animals. Our <b>2nd tag (on ID 383</b>) was of a different design with a single wide angle camera in front (this tag also constructed by Custom Animal Tracking Solutions working in collaboration with Stanford) and this represented only the 2nd deployment of this tag design on a whale. This<b> tag stayed on into the evening</b> before we recovered it and we are just starting to download and look at the images (see below) and data. Some of the initial video showed this whale in contact with the bottom and also filming a 2nd whale ahead (Patch) who appeared to also be feeding on the bottom off Hat Island. Overall these trips have provided more data than we expected both from the tags as well as the fecal samples, photo-IDs, and behavior monitoring. After studying these whales for more than 20 years, the video and tag data provide a perspective we have never before had. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective

John Calambokidis (with Jeff Foster from Cascadia and Dave Cade, Stanford) <b>deployed a video and dive recording tag on a gray whale (CRC ID 22</b>) on Friday morning at around <b>1000</b> near<b> Everett</b>, Washington. The tag was deployed with a long pole and attached to the whale with four small suction cups. The goal of the overall study is to document diving and feeding behavior of whales (video to help confirm feeding) in this region to help evaluate the proportion of their diet by prey and habitat and is being conducted with the support and collaboration of the Washington Department of Natural Resources. We initially found<b> two gray whales (ID 22 and 49) off Hat Island</b> and deployed the tag just as they were <b>joined by another pair (ID 21 and 383)</b>. The tag was deployed with a very slow approach as the whale was almost stationary and the tag was placed just a few m behind the blowhole. The tag has stayed on all day and into the night so hopefully successfully gathering video and ancillary diving kinematics data including depth, speed, acceleration, and heading but this will not be confirmed until the tag comes off and is recovered because this wealth of data is all stored on the tag. Deployment covered both low and high tide and included close to 50 documented feeding events around the Snohomish Delta, which is far better than we hoped to get on the whole effort (as long we get the tag back and it was functioning OK). Several whale watch boats arrived on the area after the tag deployment and we were able to discuss with them the function of the tag and of the study. We left the whale late in the day as the wind picked up but we could pick up the radio signal of the tag still on the whale late into the night from our hotel. Tomorrow we will look to recover this tag and continue the study.

BABIES! What an incredibly beautiful day spent with<b> J pod</b>. They spent most of the morning really spread out off the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>, but early in the <b>afternoon</b>, the entire pod grouped very tightly together just as we began our encounter. What a treat to see the new youngsters sandwiched amongst their families, popping about like corks here and there. You have to keep a sharp eye for them though! Those little rascals surface so quickly that if you blink, you will miss them. -Katie Jones

I saw what appeared to be a pod of<b> 6-8 orcas between the Fauntleroy ferry dock</b> in West Seattle and the<b> Vashon ferry dock</b> on Vashon Island. They were there for several hours from late AM to early PM. They were far away but could clearly see dorsal fins and white markings on their sides...They were very active and splashing around a lot but staying in the same basic area the whole time. Eventually a small boat approached them and was very close to them (NOAA Research boat). -Donn Bennett

We had the <b>T65A's, T65B's, T75B's and T75C</b>.  There was a new calf that was with T75B most of the day but T65B was also near it.  It still had  fetal folds and the fin is still bent over. <b>T65A2</b> was carrying around part of the kill that they were working when we arrived. -Candice Emmons, NOAA, NWFSC

<b>2:00 pm - </b>Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC reports that he and crew have identified the<b> T65As and the T65Bs</b> in the <b>Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry lane</b>, feasting on something that seems to have been a large mammal from the bits and pieces left behind. They haven't moved far in several hours but seem to have possibly started trending northward.

<b>11:05-11:40 am -</b> Wow! Now watching from the ferry I can confirm they are<b> on a kill</b>. A lot of surface activity: lunging, cartwheels, breaching, circling in coordinated movements. The pod of <b>8+ orcas</b> (including mature male and young ones) have kept to the same general area (south of the east bound ferry lanes). Tail lobbing and series of 5 to 6 breaches which elicited happy boisterous responses from some ferry riders!

Just before <b>8 PM</b>, I was sitting out on the deck enjoying a calm still evening, hoping to hear a whale, when "whoosh"! <b>A single gray whale</b> was feeding just inside the drop-off line. Feeding was quite shallow, with not a lot of blows. I watched as it made its way slowing toward <b>Mabana</b> against an apricot sunset. Spectacular! There are also getting to be noticeably more whale feeding pits visible on the beach, so I know gray whales have been by, even if I haven't seen them. -Barbara Brock

Looks like <b>J51 is a male</b>...he was with mom <b>J41</b> and<b> J47 (J19 and J35 </b>were nearby), and there did appear to be some pushing going on. A few times J47 surfaced right with J51 while J41 was a little bit ahead. J47 was breaching a bit as well, it was pretty charming and interesting to see him tagging along with the baby. I'm not sure if this photo is the baby getting a little bump or him skirting out of the water sideways (I think it is the latter as none of the other photos clearly shows another whale under him). -Tasli Shaw

Orca watchers, here's your latest update on the tagged orca <b>L84</b>. <b>14 April update - </b>The whales have continued to spend time <b>off the southwest Washington coast</b> over the past several days. As of the morning of the last update (10 April) the whales were just north of the entrance to Willapa Bay, heading south. They continued south and by the <b>morning of the 11th were off the Columbia River</b>. On the morning of the 12th, they were just <b>south of the Columbia River</b>, but heading north. The morning of the 13th found them between Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay and on the morning of the 14th they were off the middle of the Long Beach Peninsula heading south, approaching the area near the Columbia River by that evening. -Brad Hanson, NOAA, NWFSC, Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

<b>2:30pm - </b>We encountered the <b>TO49A's</b> at the south <b>East corner of James Island</b>. The Orcas were in a very sleepy mode as they <b>travelled north up Sidney Channel</b>. They did not travel very far in the time we were with them and had obviously made a kill earlier as we saw a large Stellar Sea Lions swim right past them (lucky Sea Lion. We believe these were the Transient Orcas reportedly heard on the hydro phones earlier in the day but had not been seen until we found them! -Andrew Lees, Manager &amp; Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching

<br/><b>6:23 pm  - </b>Just saw the whale fluke up, very close to the Whidbey side. We saw the whale again at<b> 6:30, 6:35 and 6:40</b> steadily plodding south. It will be fun to see which one shows up off Langley tomorrow. -Susan Berta/ Howard Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:00 pm - </b>from<b> Shore Meadow Road, Mutiny Sands</b>, Whidbey Island - heart-shaped blow back-lit by the sun<b> in Admiralty Inlet</b> followed by the distinctive roll of <b>a gray whale's back</b> heading steadily south, hopefully to join the other Puget Sound grays. Will this be a new arrival or a previous visitor we haven't yet seen this year? It's amazing to me that we have the privilege of seeing these behemoths in our local waters taking a little time out on their migration to feast on the ghost-shrimp around our island. Let's hope they all find plenty to eat. -Sandra Pollard

Trip report - The weatherman was good to us, the rain held off and we found whales! Heading south from Langley, we caught up with two favorites - <b>Gray whales #49 Patch, and #44 Dubknuck</b> as they traveled back and forth <b>between Hat Island and the Clinton ferry dock</b>. It was a little choppy, but we still had some great views of them. We heard of another whale feeding along the Langley shoreline and found #22, busily feeding on her side, many views of her pectoral fin and 'half' her tail fluke as she scooped up those little shrimp from the sediment. We watched her travel from Langley to Sandy Point. Many people in Langley watched her pass by from Whale Bell Park. It was a good day on the water! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Another day, another whale. Such is the reinvigorated whale season on Whidbey Island. It is windy, cool and chucking rain today after a blue-skied Sunday, but the boats were out whale watching regardless. Hardy souls who love water-bound mammals enjoying the feeding frenzy along <b>Langley Beach</b> again today. You'll see how windy it was from the breath spout photos. As soon as a spout happened, the wind carried it away. The boats were keeping a respectful distance from this incredible scene of<b> gray whales dining on the ghost shrimp</b>. In 2013 a group of concerned citizens formed a grassroots effort and with Langley Mayor Fred McCarthy lobbied the Department of Natural Resources to stop the ghost shrimp fishing along our shores. And won! As a result of their committed actions we are reaping the benefit because this is the fourth time this spring we've spotted feeding along our beaches. Last year, only once, and the same the year before. A good indication that if the<b> ghost shrimp are plentiful</b>, so are the gray whales who feed on them. The forecast Wednesday through next Monday is sunny and in the 60s, and the Welcome The Whales festival and parade is Saturday. A great time to hop a ferry or cross Deception Pass Bridge and head to Langley. Oh, and bring your cameras. You'll be sorry if you don't. -Debra Campbell

We met a <b>transient pod just outside of Friday Harbor</b> with the San Juan Excursion boat tour. There was a mama, her son, and her two girls. They came right up to our boat and said hello!

It was a great afternoon on the water with the <b>T49A</b> family of transient orcas. We spent some of the encounter near <b>Frost Island</b> where they appeared to be messing around with the lines on crab pots! This is a behavior I have heard about, but never witnessed until today. I guess if they find something that might be a good toy, they don't hesitate too much. I just hope they are careful about toys like that. We left them for a while to go check out some other wildlife and when we returned to the orca family, they were near the <b>Shaw Island ferry landing</b> and appeared to have made a kill. -Katie Jones

Sunday at 3pm we boarded the Mystic Sea at the Langley Marina for a benefit whale watch hosted by the Langley Main Street Association and Mystic Sea Charters...we launched toward Gedney (Hat) Island, on the lookout for <b>gray whales</b> or the rumored orcas in the area. We could never confirm any orca sightings, but just <b>east of Gedney</b> we saw the first misty blow of <b>a Gray whale</b>, cruising along the dropoff at the edge of the mud plume from the <b>Snohomish River</b>, from only 10-20 feet deep to about 600 feet deep. This Gray never fluked but from the dorsal markings we got a tentative ID as<b> #22</b>. Then we cruised back toward Gedney and encountered a "mystery" whale, with a mostly unmarked back that didn't resemble any of the grays in the catalog, so this may be a new recruit to the Saratoga grays this year. This one did some great spyhops in the few minutes we were with it, before we saw another whale 1/2 mile to the south that actually breached (or half-breached, which is as much as you can hope for in a gray whale). This one, also never positively identified, did a series of about a half dozen unusual spyhops at a 45 degree angle on its back, which was a fitting finish to the trip. (from other photos, Jill Hein ID'd <b>#383 </b>as being one of the whales seen on this cruise-ALB). -Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b>4:30pm - </b>Many who would otherwise be out watching showed such great restraint and remained gathered for the 2nd Southern Resident C.A.L.F. (Community Action Look Forward) workshop to brainstorm on orca and salmon recovery. However at the end of the workshop, reports that members of <b>J pod was still on the west side </b>allowed many of us to caravan and eventually catch fleeting glimpses from County Park of blows and dorsals as they rounded the point passed the Center for Whale Research towards Open Bay. Nothing quite like listening to the hydrophone, hearing them, but not being able to see them for nearly 45 minutes despite the frantic efforts of searching... The water was choppy, and just when I was about to give up, I spotted one!... we saw <b>about 4 pass Lime Kiln heading north</b> sort of close to shore...They were spread out and very hard to see due to the water, but I was happy nonetheless to spend a little time with the beautiful black and whites! -Rachel Haight

The <b>J16 matriline</b> did the <b>west side shuffle off San Juan Island</b> today. On the water we watched them travel from <b>False Bay to Hannah Heights between 13:45 and 14:30</b>. Then back on shore they milled off <b>Lime Kiln from 15:30-16:30</b>, apparently foraging, before slowly continuing north...The J16s have been the only J-Pod whales around for the last couple of days, which is a bit odd, but maybe it has something to do with the fact that two of our newest members are in their family group. It was great to see two very active babies in<b> J50 (mom J16 Slick) and J52 (mom J36 Alki)</b>, and also to see that the whale watch boats were all voluntarily giving the family lots of extra space. -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J16 Matriline </b>Report. We spent the afternoon and evening with the J16 matriline, including the two new calves, <b>J50 and J52</b>. The orcas were spread out off the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> foraging. The females and calves stayed almost exclusively inshore, while J26 Mike would repeatedly forage off shore. It was amazing to watch J50 though, she is such an independent and spunky calf! J16 Slick is not going to have it easy keeping track of this little one! J50 was close to the others, but not right at her mother's side as you may expect. She was seen engaging with all of the family members, and it would seem that J26 Mike was babysitting for some of the time.
We saw J26 Mike act out a variety of behaviors including tail slapping, kelping, pectoral slaps as he rolled through the water, and breaching. Whether J26 was using this behavior as a foraging tactic, or just for fun remains up for question! It seemed that the whales were in a "down to business" mode yesterday, and were very serious about foraging- as they should be with two lactating females in the group.
<br/>The most interesting behavior we witnessed came just towards the end of our first trip when most of the orcas were heading north again, but one stayed behind. Yep, you guessed it, J50 stayed behind and became quite social. It seemed that she was acting out similar behaviors as J26 (big brother) that we had seen a short time before. J50 started to roll through the water as well, trying to slap her pectoral flippers, as well as spyhopping (I can't tell you how adorable it was to see a bright pink/orange calf rolling through the water trying to pectoral slap). By the end of her playfulness J52 had also joined in socializing, and the orcas seemed to come back around to escort the playful calves north again. These mothers are certainly going to have their "flippers" full with these two little ones! The calves definitely seem very healthy, and with such a high mortality rate (50% or more), we hope there will soon be ample salmon filling these waters to ensure they always stay healthy. -Heather McIntyre, Legacy Charters

<b>T49C</b> going south in <b>San Juan Channel with Deer Harbor</b> in the background. Today we started out with beautiful weather, a full boat, and no whale reports.

This afternoon around <b>2 PM</b> I saw the <b>T65As </b>head north past <b>Lime Kiln</b>. They were fairly close to shore doing lots of milling; they may have made a kill right before I got there as they were tightly circling and tail slapping a lot. When they started traveling again, they cruised right past the rocks in front of the lighthouse, taking a moment to harass a Steller sea lion on their way by! From our boat we <b>met up with them off Snug Harbor at 3 PM</b>, where they <b>went into Open Bay</b> and then continued north along the shoreline of Henry Island. Finally, at <b>4:30 PM, I saw them once more from shore at Reuben Tarte County Park</b> - they were just rounding Green Point after having gone<b> through Spieden Channel</b> and disappeared behind Spieden from my vantage point. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

We had a great trip today that was full of excitement! After a long period away, my favorite group of<b> Transient Orcas, the T065A's</b> have returned to the Salish Sea. When we met up with the T065A's for the second time they were traveling through <b>Spieden Channel</b> where they proceeded to actively forage going down on long dives, and being very sporadic with their movement. We watched as they made a slow pass by Green Point where there were about 50 sea lions in the area. For a mammal that needs to consume about 400-500 lbs a day, a (roughly) 2,000 sea lion would have been a good meal! No one knew what would happen, and we wondered if the one pass we saw would be it. Maybe they decided it wasn't worth the effort to attack? But, that one pass-bye wasn't it! The whales ended up circling back around and made an attempt at the sea lions; unfortunately, it was a failed attempt. What happened after the orcas attempted to separate a sea lion was very interesting- all of the sea lions appeared to band together and chase the orcas off! They were noticeably agitated (as you can imagine), growing loudly, and continued to follow the orcas a short distance seemingly warding them off. I guess there's truth when they say there's power in numbers!! -Heather McIntyre, Naturalist, Legacy Charters

Trip report: Headed out with sunny skies and a light wind, getting a few reports of some grays south past the Clinton/Mukilteo Ferry. The wind got stronger, so when reports came in of <b>two grays (#22 and #56) north of Langley</b>, Capt. Monte made a quick u-turn to get back into calmer water. We came upon these two and surprisingly, they stayed extremely close together throughout the entire encounter. They were generally heading south, but moving around toward Camano, then toward Langley. Saw some great views of their blow holes, and some very nice fluke up tail dives, allowing the passengers to clearly see the differences in the white pattern on the underside. As we left them, they were headed over to Camano, most likely for some feeding. Another beautiful day on Mystic Sea with great passengers, including some kids who got their very first whale sighting! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

<b>12:50pm -</b> Hi! On our first visit to San Juan Island, and were lucky enough to be able to watch<b> a pod of orcas </b>swimming north- south off the coast alongside<b> West Side Road</b>. Only saw two at any one time, but I suspect it was a bigger group than that. Traveling and some playing. -Ros McNamara

<b>J17 Princess Angeline</b> foraging off Lime Kiln on the west side of San Juan Island this afternoon. <b>J-Pod</b> was super spread out as they made their way south through Haro Strait, with most of the whales being on the Canadian side. Seas were rough and dive times were long, so I don't think all whales were documented. That means the mystery of who J52's mother  will continue! -Monika Wieland

<b>10:00 am -</b> was on what we call the <b>Bandon High Spot</b>, approx. 43 05. 124 50. It's about 18 mi. west of <b>Bandon, Oregon</b>. <b>Single male</b> followed right alongside us for 15-20 min. while we were trolling for salmon. Appeared to be all by himself. While he was with us he appeared to be very curious about us. He stayed about 10' from our starboard side for about 15 min. He would dive to a depth of maybe 10 or 20 feet and swim parallel to us for a couple of minutes, then surface and kind of roll on his side a little and stare at us with one big eye. He repeated the same basic maneuver 8 or 10 times before he swam off. We were in a area with a fair amount of feed that had several humpbacks feeding on it and were catching occasional salmon. There were also sea lions in the area, including some very young ones. The salmon we caught were empty so I'm not sure what we were metering but sardines and shrimp were being caught in the general area. -Ken Gossard

After work I followed up a report of <b>killer whales spotted south of Discovery</b> by a colleague out fishing.  I went out searching and came across <b>T065, T063, and T049C</b> west bound <b>south of Constance Bank</b>.  I left them south of Race still tracking west.  On my way home I came across the T065A's west of Constance Bank also tracking west. -Mark Malleson

<b>9:30am - Saw 3 Orcas,</b> 1 was a calf, off of <b>Libby Beach</b> (due <b>west of Coupeville</b>, near Partridge Pt. and Partridge Bank) took some photos of them and was wondering what pod they were from. (Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research looked through many photos and ID'd the pod as the<b> T36As and T49Bs</b>) -Linda Noack

<b>8:30am - </b>from Chatham Lane, just south of <b>Hastie Lake Rd</b>. (NW Whidbey - between Coupeville &amp; Oak Harbor) Patty and I saw <b>a female Orca and young one heading south</b> about 200 yards from shore at a steady pace. -David Cohick

Trip report - Sunny skies and calm seas, we headed south from Langley and before long one of our passengers spotted the first "blow".... we found<b> two whales</b>, to the west of Hat Island.<b> #21 and #22 </b>traveling together towards <b>Hat Island </b>in a feeding pattern - several surfaces and then a dive - giving us some good looks at #22's fluke. We continued around the north of Hat Island, and found #53, known as Little Patch. He appeared to be by himself, taking long dives. #22 was the active whale for us today, she and #21 mugged the boat at one point, giving us an exceptional view of these magnificent whales. Another super day aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

<b>6:48pm - Gray whale Mabana Beach Camano Island</b> near shore. <b>Moving south.</b> -Sally Olin

<b>6:24pm - Three whales.</b> Heading west. Just saw one do a spy hop. Not sure if that is the correct terminology for grey whales.
<br/><b>6:00pm -  Blows off the south end of Gedney Island</b>. I am assuming it's a grey whale based on the length between blows. Pretty stationary. -Danielle Pennington

Amazing encounter with whales <b>22, 383, 56, and 49</b> at <b>Camano Head</b> aboard the Island Explorer 3. A feeding frenzy in shallow waters that we will forever remember! -Michael Colahan
