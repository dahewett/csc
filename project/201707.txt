<b>6:25 p.m.</b> - Saw them but a long way off, didn't bother with photos, but fun to see all their blows and distant dorsals...still northbound, the clipper is now passing them. Too far out to see from Fort Casey (I'm at <b>Ledgewood</b>). -Jill Hein

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Tom Reeve of Lopez Island reports a small group of <b>orcas far offshore of Flint Beach, southern end of Lopez Island</b>, travelling slowly west at 7:45 pm Monday evening, July 31.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Viewed at <b>Ft Casey until 7:15. They (T46Bs and T117s) </b>split, with some pushing further west as they traveled north, while a group stayed <b>close to shore along Ft Casey</b>. Lots of people got wonderful looks and their lit up blows were breathtaking. Watched for an hour, at <b>7:15</b>, the other group was further west and north of PT, while the closer group started to push NW. Haven't resighted from Ebeys Landing yet.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:00 a.m. - Whale spray and tail in Puget sound Narrows</b>. Heading north about 500 yards south of the Narrows bridge right now. Going real slow. Looks like only one whale. Stays underwater for about 10 minutes then does 2-3 sprays. Too far away to get pictures. I think he is feeding. Hasn't moved very far in the past hour. -Mark Hansen

<br/><i>Notes on Humpback Calves by Tasli Shaw, Naturalist, who runs Humpbacks of the Salish Sea Facebook Page: "So the story so far as I can tell with the photos that have been posted there are three confirmed calves: Split Fluke's, Smiley' s, and now Hydra's confirmed today. There are two that I am not so sure of, one is Avalanche, based off the few photos from Alethea it looks too white to be a calf, and no one else has shared images to corroborate the sighting. The second question mark is Europa (a BCXuk listed in Keta Coastal.Conservation) that was photographed by Janine a few weeks ago with what appears to be a calf. But again, there are no other photos of these two on any other day, so it's not confirmed. Still, 3 babies is pretty awesome for around here!"</i>

Another spectacular day on the Salish Sea - no orca reports today, so it was a <b>'one' humpback </b>day - and he/she was on a mission traveling from point A (<b>Tumbo Island/East Point</b>) towards point B (Patos Island), lots of surfacing but no tail flukes, sometimes hitting 9 nm/hr! We had some great viewing of this whale before turning for home via several harbor seal haul-outs, bald eagle viewing, and some elusive harbor porpoise. A beautiful day on the water! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Unidentified killer whales - Sighted Orca Whales on the <b>west side of Camano Island </b>(heading south toward Camano Head) from <b>Bells Beach, Whidbey Island.</b> Feeding. Playing moving fast. (After some inquiry) - I can't positively say that the whales I spotted were Orca Whales. My neighbors and I spotted the whales swimming fast, thrashing and cutting through the water like they were manuvering in on fish.
The distance between us and the whales made it difficult to see them clearly. I am fairly certain there was more than one whale.  My neighbor Francia says that she positively black and white whales leaping out of the water...-Best Regards, Joe Wolcott

July 28 - Eastern Juan de Fuca - Beautiful day out at <b>Partridge Bank and Eastern Bank. As we watched the first humpback</b>, we could see it "shark finning", gliding under the water with just the dorsal fin showing! The second one was a bit far away, but at least he/she did a nice straight-on fluke up! Seals are adorable, as always! (Partridge Bank approx 3-4 kn miles south of Smith Island 3-4 west of Whidbey. Eastern Bank approx 5 kn miles SW of Smith Island). Humpback  BCYUnknown "Scratchy" - Eastern Juan de Fuca. -Bonnie Gretz

Thanks to a sharp eyed neighbor, I had a chance to see my first ever<b> humpback on Camano</b>.  What a show: almost continuous lunge feeding, occasionally highlighted by pec slaps,and a breach or 2 or 3.  It was a ways off our bluff<b> south of Mabana</b>, heading north and west toward Whidbey. The neighborhood watched for over half and hour, around<b> 7:30 PM</b>. -Barbara Brock

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:55 p.m. - Currently in Carr Inlet </b>heading north. Lots of fun breaches to watch. Started in mid-channel which was great for me on the east side, but it headed to west side which meant it got too far out of sight for me. -Sarah Richey Guenther

July 28 - Case Inlet, South Puget Sound - After reading the reports, we couldn't resist heading out to see if we could get fluke shots. We found them <b>just south of Harstine Island bridge</b>, as one came up just on the other side of a boat that was watching for them. We stayed with them down to Hope Island. We did manage to get fluke shots of both of them, though with the shallow water, they weren't showing that well. Neither one of them was the same whale we've been seeing in Carr Inlet for the last few weeks.All the boaters following the whales were trying to keep the required distance, which was really nice to see. -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Passed under <b>Harstine Bridge at 7:00ish this evening</b>. Lots of blowing and two full showings (2 spouts at same time). -Gretchen Stewart

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

From around <b>5:50 to 7:10 tonight</b>, my dad, his friends, and myself took our boat out and followed the <b>pair of humpback whales south down Pickering Passage</b>. We first caught up to them across from Geralds Cove, and we left them near the Harstine Island Bridge. (We stayed "Whale Wise" no need to worry.) One of the whales had the dot on its left dorsal fin making me think that it might be the same one that was hanging around down here back in May and June. 
<br/><b>Humpback</b> we've all been calling "Dot" - <b>Case Inlet</b>. 
Taken at 4:16 P.M., from a mile south of Dougall/Harstine Point on the East side of the island.
<br/><b>5:36 p.m. -</b> They are now heading south down <b>Pickering Passage</b>, spotted from the north end of Harstine.
<br/><b>4:06 p.m. - There's two of them</b>. Just both surfaced <b>between Herron and Harstine closer to Harstine</b>. They were heading north quickly, and they were very close to shore. I have pictures of both whales that I can share later. They are now north of Harstine heading north towards the Stretch Island Bridge. -Connor O'Brien

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:10 p.m. - Humpback just passed close to McMicken Island</b>, on east side of <b>Harstine Island</b>, slowly heading north in Case Inlet at 3:10pm. Clearly saw its dorsal and fluke, but no pics. -Dave Berliner

<b>3:30 pm - 5:00 pm - T37As.</b> When we first headed out they had been reported near Matia headed south but when we got there they were <b>hugging the shore along the north end of Orcas</b>. They stayed close to shore for about an hour, then come out into open water. They began chasing down a harbor porpoise shortly after that. Mom - <b>T37A did most of the work flipping the porpoise into the air</b> several times, then the younger whales came in and seemed to participate once there was less activity. The predation event lasted about 8 to 10 minutes total and they left the lungs and some of the internal organs behind when they were finished. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

I went whale watching with the San Juan Clipper. While we did not see any orcas, we did eventually find this <b>humpback whale</b> around the <b>southeast end of Patos Island</b>. We stayed with it from <b>3:45-4:15 P.M</b>. At first it was surfacing at unpredictable locations, with long down times. Around <b>4:10 it started "mugging" a boat</b>. This is a picture from when it was doing that. I have a picture of part of it's underside fluke that I can share in the comments in case that will help identify it. Left underside fluke tip of Humpback CS631 "Two Spot"  (or CRC-16017). -Connor O'Brien

<b>L pod -Juan de Fuca</b> - ...I decided to turn and head east towards Dungeness in the event that they had stalled out during the night as they had a large flood to contend with. As I was approaching Papa Alpha I received a call that killer whales had been located a couple of miles east of us spread out west bound. A few minutes later we came across <b>L103 and L123</b> and could see they were spread out laterally for a mile moving quickly with the building ebb current averaging 7 knots....-See full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 57.

July 25 - <b>J pod - Rosario Strait</b> - Our evening sail with J pod was much different than our afternoon trip. We heard on the radio that <b>J pod had been playing with a harbor porpoise</b> for about an hour. When we arrived they were in a tight group circling with occasional spy hops while pushing around the porpoise on their rostrums. <b>25 whales in all engaging in this activity</b>. At some point the whales briefly changed to a straight course followed by several breaches, including <b>L87</b> a full grown male repeatedly half breaching. Their behavior changed again by slowly circling/milling with relaxed breaths. It was as if we were watching transient orcas. We heard only a few orca vocalizations on the hydrophone. -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

We left the marina a bit early, and quickly got a report of <b>orcas near Lummi Island, up Rosario Strait</b>. It was <b>J pod</b>! Such a treat to see residents, and they were very actively fishing, with great bursts of speed, twisting and turning through the water as they chased down those yummy salmon. <b>All of J pod was reported</b>, though spread out from Village Point, to Pt. Laurence and the Charlie buoy. We got great looks at <b>J27 Blackberry</b>, with his huge dorsal fin and distinctive open saddle patch on his left side, and both <b>Cookie (J38)</b>, who at 14 is really starting to sprout a large dorsal fin, and his mom, <b>Oreo, J22</b>. We also saw at least two of the young calves born in 2015 as well as <b>J47 Notch</b> (now 7 years old), and many others (est. about 20). It was a beautiful, warm day, with glass smooth water and beautiful views of Mt. Baker, and all the lovely small islands in Rosario. A large group of harbor seals and their adorable pups, and at least four bald eagles just enhanced another wonderful wildlife tour on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist, Mystic Sea

After hearing about <b>Southern Residents spread out and moving sporadically up and down the west side of San Juan Island</b>, we arrived at <b>Hannah Heights about 4:30</b> and were treated to small dorsals in ones and twos many hundreds of yards below us in the tidal rip. Then about 5:20 suddenly a tight group of <b>8-10 showed up moving south, followed 100 yards back by another group</b>. Less than five minutes later they had flipped a 180 and turned north past us, moving faster this time with the currents, still close to the rocky shoreline. So we hightailed it up to CWR north of Lime Kiln and they soon arrived, now more spread out but all moving decisively north up Haro Strait. Alisa joined us there shortly before Ken Balcomb mentioned there were a couple of spaces on his boat Shachi to document who's there. We launched from Snug Harbor and within a few minutes had <b>rounded Kellet Bluff and found the trailers of the bunch about 6:19</b>. We puttered along parallel at a good distance with the sun at our backs lighting up dorsals and blows and occasional spyhops with bright forested bluffsides for background. Over the next half hour we were witness to the slow travels of the <b>L47s, the L72s, the L26s, the L4s, the J17s, the J11s, and of course the adaptable L87</b> moving around the families. We heard the<b> J16s were a mile or so ahead of us</b>. All in all a peak experience in perfect conditions. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

And the fun wasn't over! ...we rushed back to the west side as the <b>Js and Ls came back past Lime Kiln</b>. In the evening they finally committed to going north and it was beautiful to see 35 of those present traveling in one group, pictured here with Spieden Island in the background. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, July 23, 2017

<b>4:48 p.m. - Js and Ls heading north at Hannah Heights/Land Bank.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

By <b>1:00 pm. Js and Ls </b>joined up and were now heading back north. Arrived at the north pullout at <b>Land Bank</b> met up with Connie, walked down to rocks and soon after watched single female in the lead and approx 4-6 others pass including young ones. A large group was coming up behind. They all looked pretty committed, so I decided to move to Lime Kiln since the leaders had passed the lighthouse. About when I arrived looking south I could see the the large group had stalled and was engaging in a lot of foraging and surface activity back off Land Bank. The <b>5-6 whales we had off Lime Kiln</b> foraged for about 45 minutes moving back and forth in the currents. We had 5-6 including 2 calves. This smaller group  eventually turned south and joined up with the others off Land Bank and looked to be heading south. I waited around Lime Kiln and it paid off. Around <b>2:30pm they flipped back north</b>, I could hear and see them coming towards us. Shortly after most all of Js and some Ls reached LK park with some going beyond the lighthouse. Lots of social and foraging behavior, very surface active (breaches, spyhops, tail lobs, pec slaps, rolling, inverted tail slaps, vocalizing, socializing) Stunning back and forth passes the entire stretch of the park. At one point, off the south lookout <b>about 10 whales lined up in formation side by side as if in some greeting ceremony</b>, some logging and then a few started tail slapping. Later, <b>one whale, while moving towards the rocks, cartwheeled off the rocks, moved in closer and cartwheeled a 2nd time just feet from those standing at waters edge</b> then continued to swim underwater along the shoreline to the south. They all eventually turned back south while we all absorbed and appreciated these beings we just hung out with and what we were lucky enough to be a part of. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

The <b>L4s, L26s, L47s, and L72s </b>made it in overnight, and this morning <b>J-Pod came in to join them</b>. It was a pretty special several hours this afternoon on the west side, including this once in a lifetime moment for me - I can only imagine this mom and calf must have been eye to eye underwater as they stopped and bobbed at the surface just a few yards off the rocks right in front of us. 
<br/><b>1:10 p.m - Leaders at Hannah Heights</b> northbound.  
<br/><b>12:34 p.m - Js are about halfway across aiming for Ls at False Bay</b>.

<b>9:30 a.m. - from South Beach spotted few dorsals off Eagle Point</b>. Moved over to Eagle Point and watched who turned out to be the <b>L4s</b> (per Center for Whale Research) <b>off Eagle Point</b> and to the north. Around 1<b>0:15am</b> they gathered into a couple of groups and slowly headed north. Overcast skies, slight wind and mildly rough water. They made it to about <b>Edwards Point then stalled and flipped direction</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Center for Whale Research: Stewart went on another early morning whale search by car down to the south end of SJI and saw<b> whales off South Beach</b> again. Phone calls were made and then Stewart, Astrid, and Candice met Dave down at the boat and left Snug Harbor at 0740. We found our first <b>whales right off Eagle Point at 0808</b>....By this time it was obvious that we only had the L4s on the west side of SJI. Jeff LaMarsh then found the <b>L26s, L47s, and L72s out near Race Rocks</b>...-Photos &amp; full encounter summary at Center for Whale Research Encounter 54

Today we met up with the <b>T34s, T37, and T37Bs near Stuart Island</b>, following them <b>around Turn Point into Boundary Pass</b> on this beautiful Pacific Northwest drizzly summer afternoon. These transient killer whales are so different from the residents I've spent more time with.

July 19 - A magnificent day to be out on the <b>Salish Sea</b>....clear skies, warm breeze, fairly calm waters, as we motored between the San Juan Islands, then headed west <b>through Cattle Pass</b>. Along the way we stopped to see adorable harbor seal pups and their moms, basking on the rocks. We also saw a bald eagle family, two adults and a dark brown juvenile. As we headed out into Haro Strait, we found <b>two minke whales</b>, our smallest baleen whale, feeding off Eastern Bank. Minkes are notorious for being elusive, and these two stayed true to that! We truly are lucky to live in such a beautiful place, and be able to share with our wonderful passengers. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Tuesday July 18 - choices, choices, go find the Biggs (transient) killer whales, or welcome back our endangered Resident orcas - L-pod - to the Salish Sea! L-pod won! We traveled inter-island towards the <b>west side of San Juan Island, finding L-pod </b>very spread out as they foraged. A lot of whales in the distance, so good to see them back in our waters. We identified a few -<b> L-72, Racer (see photo below) and her son L105 Fluke, also L116 Finn</b> (t<i>hanks to Melisa Pinnow, CWR</i>). Homeward bound we checked out harbor seals with pups - and several bald eagles - the weather was outstanding - a great day to be aboard the Mystic Sea!! Welcome back L-pod! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Sure was wonderful to see <b>L pod members</b> today! According to the Center for Whale Research, <b>everyone except the L12's and the L54's</b> were present. Here's to hoping their bellies are full of Chinook salmon! The best thing we can do for this critically Endangered group of Killer whales, is to bring back their food! Supporting dam removal projects, habitat restoration, pollution mitigation, and choosing sustainably harvested seafood and avoiding farmed salmon. "No fish, no Blackfish." -Traci Walter

Beautiful orca sightings on the west side of San Juan Island near<b> Lime Kiln State Park</b>!! Two different pods with at least 7-8 whales.. Breeching, hunting and swimming about. Stunning!! We saw them multiple times throughout the day.. the most activity we viewed was <b>10am, 12pm and 2pm.</b> Around 12 they passed though pretty quickly. 10am and later in the day they seemed to hang out much longer in one area. Unfortunately, I did not get any photos. I was on shore and had my binoculars to see them. -Guinevere Ilana

<b>7:25 p.m. -</b> We received a phone call from Mike at WA State Ferries, reporting a single orca in Possession Sound, south of the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes</b>, heading south at 7:25 pm. (<i>may have been the humpback in the area, see reports  above - ALB</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1430-1540 - Lone Humpback.</b> Position: 47 48 03   122 27 22 (Approx <b>1.7 nm east of Kingston Ferry</b>). Milling about in approx 1/4 mile area, changed direction several times. Typical arched back for terminal dives, no flukes displayed. Consistent 5-6 breaths between dives. Dives consistently 9-10 minutes in length. Light very flat so no color variations observed on back or dorsal fin. Observed from: 45' sailboat drifting with the current. -Gary Carter, S/V Delphinus, Port of Edmonds

July 15 - <b>WA Coast - Noon</b> - Good evening ON, Wanted you to know that my family saw about a <b>8-12 gray whales just off the shore of Kalaloch Lodge</b> on Saturday afternoon. Four to six were very close to the breakers, mostly feeding I believe and others were moving in a little further out. I took a few photos if you are interested...no real breaching and I have just one photo of one upper whale tail. Was a treat to see on the Washington Coast. -Sue Larkin

<b>8:05 p.m. - approximately between Matia Island and the northern tip of Lummi Island, 5-7 orcas</b>. We are watching them very distantly from the north shore of Orcas Island and we can't tell if they are residents or transients, and we are also having a hard time pinpointing exactly where they are since we are so far, though with our good binoculars we can see them. We noticed about eight boats in a group watching them...-Rob Lodermeier

Another beautiful day on Friday - and exciting to hear we had<b> Biggs (transient) killer whales just outside Anacortes</b>. Several groups of <b>T's, T46s, 36s, 36Bs and 99s</b>, very spread out! Wow - a lot of whales. We traveled with them slowly southbound for a while, then took a side trip to check out the seals w/pups on Colville Island, and several bald eagles. With time to spare, we headed back to the group of T's as they frolicked and fed right off NAS Whidbey, traveling back and forth, still spread out. After some great viewing of these amazing whales, we reluctantly headed back to port - another great day aboard the Mystic Sea. 14-year-old male T46E, one of the many Bigg's/Transient orcas encountered traveling together today in Rosario and Eastern Juan de Fuca Straits. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

July 14 - South Puget Sound - This was near the <b>south end of Fox Island in the Carr Inlet at about 4:30 pm</b>. We just got back in from jet skiing! This guy breached about 50 yards from us, really startling!! We moved away and had a great time watching this amazing animal! -Dawn Morris

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Heard whale <b>breathing at 1 am</b>, located in the area of<b> Gertrude Is off McNeil</b>. Seemed to be in "sleeping" mode. What I am currently witnessing, and what I believe I am hearing, <b>appears to me to be a humpback whale</b>. It seems to always travel solo. It was close enough around the time of my first report that I could tell it was definitely not an orca and appeared to me to be a humpback. The whale breaching yesterday definitely looked like a humpback whale to me through binoculars. -Erin Dugger Reetz

July 14 - Central Puget Sound - Hello! Friday <b>9:00 am a humpback passed very close to shore in Dilworth</b>. Inside the buoys and between the fishing boats! Slowly made it's way north and more toward the shipping lanes than shore. 9:40 I could see off in the distance headed past Glen Acres towards the ferry. -Aimee Demarest

South Puget Sound - <b>8:18 p.m. - Single orca playfully spyhopping across Carr Inlet between Fox island and McNeil towards Chambers Bay</b>. I am 99% certain it was an orca. Very active spyhopping. Thought i saw an eye patch - I don't want to lead people astray - sure looked like an orca to me and friend. <b>It was there again this am (July 14th)</b> (there was <b>also a humpback in this very area </b>reported by a few others). -Edward StOnge

July 13 - Eastern Juan de Fuca - They were headed that way (towards Admiralty) but made a kill then turned and <b>headed back towards Minor</b> when we left them~~ -Marcie Barney Goldberg

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I watched from about <b>5:50-6:45</b>. Could see whales [<b>orcas</b>] for a bit, then boats took a turn west and I left then. Very possible some continued south but they were far enough offshore you could barely see with binos. -Rachel Haight

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We may have Ts entering Admiralty Inlet tonight! <b>T51, T37, 37Bs and possibly the 34's.</b> Big group that split right before we left them. Heading south angling toward the Sound. They were just passing Naval Air Station southbound at<b> 5:30</b>, we turned and came home through Deception. They were last reported just <b>north of Minor Island at 6:00 pm</b>. They had longish down times. It's possible they eventually went west but it's also approaching being too far south for most boats out there. I'm hoping they kept going south! -Renee Beitzel

Those aboard Mystic Sea's Whale Watching cruise on Thursday got to see a bit of everything! We had lovely weather and wildlife sightings both in and out of the water. We began our journey traveling to the south side of Lopez Island where we spent 90 minutes with a group of transient orcas as they swam about. This group of <b>8 to 10 gigantic whales were later identified as the T37As and possibly the T77s</b>. We stayed with them as they demonstrated their beauty and grace before cruising on towards <b>Smith Island</b>. Once there, passengers saw a puffin (which typically happens less than a handful of times each season)! We then ventured on to Minor Island where we stopped to gaze at harbor seals with their pups and a golden eagle as it feasted...-Amy W., Mystic Sea

July 11 - San Juans - The year of the transients continues! This afternoon we met up with the<b> T99s, T36, T36Bs, and T37A1 in President's Channel </b>and followed them over towards Sucia off the north end of Orcas Island. We were debating on what date the number of encounters we have this year with the Southern Residents might surpass the number of encounters we've had with transients, but it's starting to feel like that may not ever happen, as there continue to be multiple groups of Ts around the Salish Sea on a daily basis and the days continue to slip off the calendar with no word on the salmon-eating residents. -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI

July 11 - South Puget Sound - Tuesday night <b>west of Chambers Bay</b>. The whale was <b>between Fox and McNeil islands</b>. It must be spending its time between Chambers Bay and the two islands. Lots of bait fish in the area. Bait fish must be feeding on plankton/krill.
Quite a few porpoise as well. -Photo by Jon Tornquist, July 11

Sunday, July 9: Our trip took us into Canadian waters today, where the<b> T37A transient orcas, accompanied by lone male T51,</b> were busy tracking down an unsuspecting harbor porpoise for lunch <b>near Sidney, B.C.</b> We watched with baited breath as the whales circled their prey, slapping the water with their tails and submerging slowly as they closed in on their victim. Eventually, with some celebratory breaches and spy-hops, they headed in towards the shoreline and continued on their travels in search of the next meal. And talking of meals - as we sailed towards home we were privileged to see a bald eagle returning to the nest to feed her chick. Yet again we enjoyed a taste of nature's dramatic diversity here in the wonderful Pacific Northwest. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Swanson Channel - With great anticipation due to an early report of<b> Transient (Bigg's) orcas off Moresby Island (Canada)</b>, very slowing heading north, we motored up through the San Juan Islands, through the scenic beauty of Pole Pass, on a bright and calm day. With many passengers aboard from out of state, and many who had never seen a whale, we caught up with <b>T101 (born 1973)</b>, her two grown sons (<b>T101A and T101B</b>), and another large male, at Moresby Island, in the Swanson Channel. They were slowing moving north, with some back and forth and circling, before they turned southwest as we left to find <b>two gray whales off Bird Rocks</b>, quite near to Anacortes. Neither of these off season visitors match the identification of our "regular Sounders" gray whales who spend March-May around Whidbey and Camano Islands. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>7:30 to 8:15 p.m.</b> - watching from Old Creosote on <b>Bainbridge</b>. Several whales observed going back and forth, spy hops, tail slaps. They would be in tight groups and then spread out. Too many whales to count as they would quickly move out of the scope. We were able to share and educate some travelers who had just stopped by to take a picture of the ferry as it passed. Stayed with us for about 45 min. What glorious day to live in the PNW and share natures beauty and amazing creatures with others.

July 5 - <b>Puget Sound - Noon- 12:20 p.m. - </b>Just now, <b>humpback</b>, just southwest of south Vashon and ferry!!! Heading east. We observed <b>BCX1251 Orion from about noon to 12:20pm</b>. He was heading east just slightly. He would come up about 3 times for air? and then dive. He continued this pattern the whole time. He turned and headed towards the south end of Vashon for just a very short time. He then turned around back towards the center of the channel. He dove one more time, and when he finally came up he had headed east and had traveled quite a distance. It looked like he kept on that course as we headed the opposite direction.

We've watched this whale the past couple of days, and I hope the whale is now just in a rest mode but it seems unbothered by boats that inadvertently zoom right past it. I want to make sure there's no alarm over entanglement in a net that would prevent it from diving properly or whatever. I hope this makes sense.

Generally they are just passing through. I am assuming it was a humpback. I think it traveled north when it left this area. -Aimee Demarest
