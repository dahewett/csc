Just as I was leaving it showed its Fluke and the Whale is not either one of the two that were here most of last summer. I will try and get a good I.D. photo in the next few days to put on Orca Cam. Maybe we can keep track of some of these guys. I believe J Pod went back north last night. Dave said they never did come by the center yesterday evening. Probably see them tommorow. Tom

All in all, we have been very blessed with sightings this year. I don't know if they are around more, or if the network is just helping us all to be more aware and more watchful. In any case, it has been wonderful! Deborah Houseworth

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Here's more on J-pod from Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, &amp; an alert to keep a lookout for J32: Dave and I watched several of the J-pod spread out northbound along the west side of San Juan Island this afternoon, and with the wind and sun glare we could only confirm 9-10 of the pod present, but they were spread out over about three miles of coastline. Last seen heading north at ~ 4pm north of the Center. I'll be back on watch and computer tommorrow... Cheers, Kelley Please let everyone know both Dave and I have not confirmed J-32 in several passes by the Center, and we ask any boats and naturalists to get a good look (preferably pictures) of the 5 year-old orphan J-32; hopefully she's hanging with J-22 and her calf J-34. At this point we would like confirmation of reports that "all are present". We have not seen her now in several passes by when conditions have been good! Cross our fingers and hope she's just fine, thanks! Kelley

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> And this from my favorite acupuncturist.....luckily she had no appointments while the whales swam by her Langley office ; ) Thank you so much Susan for your phone call. I was very fortunate to have a "no show" at noon, so I ran over to where I could view Sandy Point from Langley, and I could see a few orcas in the distance. I followed them as they entered Saratoga Passage at about 12:15. As I walked along the sidewalk, with a veiw of the water, I became the Langley town cryer, calling all citizens out to view the orcas. Many heeded the call and it was a wonderful shared event, which never would have occurred without your call! As they entered the passage, only two whales stayed on the Langley side. The others headed toward Camano and were soon beyond my ability to see them (I had no binoculars on hand). One of the whales close to Langley was a male and he was traveling extremely fast. He did seem to check in with some kayakers on his way north (lucky folks!). Both whales were out of sight by 12:45 when I headed back inside. Thanks again for making this whale filled day possible!! Deborah 
<br/> Thanks to all of you for sharing what has been a wonderful, whale-filled day!! And thanks especially to J-pod, for gracing us with their presence on this beautiful day~ Susan

They saw the orcas over near Camano, &amp; saw one of the J-Moms &amp; her baby playing.

<br/><b>Members:</b>
<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	north 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> And from Bart Rulon: Dear Susan, I spent my morning looking for gray whales on the sw side of Whidbey. Early I only saw 5 dall's porpoise across from Langley. On my last stop I was very surprised to see an orca surface close to shore at Randall Pt. just north of the Clinton ferry dock probably around 10:30 - 11:00am. From there I could see four individuals headed north. I followed them along taking pictures, and saw one cow with calf. Also saw some darting movements at the surface which looked like they were preying on salmon. At Sandy point about 11:45am - Noon a few orcas passed very close to the point. from there some swam close to Langley and others split off towards Camano Island. From the scenic viewpoint on Sully's bluff off Saratoga Rd. I also saw one gray whale show its tail flukes, headed north across near Camano Island. The orcas passed East Point, or Fox Spit around 1:45 - 2:15pm. The big adult male cruised right next to the point for a great view, but most of the others were out at mid channel or near Camano. I'm not sure of the individuals, but the photos should tell the story later. Towards the middle of the day the orcas did some breaching, tail and flipper slapping. A Great Day, Bart Rulon 
 What a great day! susan

<br/><b>Direction:</b> 	north 	
 <br/><b>Comments:</b> First our report: We went out in our kayaks &amp; managed to catch a quick glimpse of J pod going through Saratoga Passage. I saw J-1 &amp; one or two others near Elger Bay off Camano Island at about 3:20, Howie saw them further north, &amp; ID'd J1&amp; J8, &amp; saw one other orca with them. We kept waiting for the rest of them to appear, but never saw them, so they either slipped by or they had split up. We saw several breaches as they traveled north in Saratoga Passage, but couldn't tell which direction they headed after that. We talked to some guys on the beach who said they'd seen orcas off North Beach (north of Greenbank, Whidbey Island) earlier this morning, &amp; yesterday afternoon......but yesterday afternoon they were seen off the west side of the island, so am not sure what to make of that! We came home to a message from John Calambokidis, who was out doing a gray whale survey for Cascadia Research, &amp; also saw orcas off Hat Island at 10:45 am. Now we're all headed to John's Gray Whale talk tonight in Freeland - a whale-filled day! Susan &amp; Howie

The last time I looked back they were very slowly headed right at the Point off of the Keystone Ferry landing. They were having a great time feeding on Salmon this afternoon and it is highly possible they turned back around. They also appeared to be bunching up as we left and could have taken a nap. Will let you know if i hear any more. Tom

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Hi Susan, J-pod snuck up on us from the north at 1345 today... I heard echolocation clicks nearly 30 minutes before I saw first whales passing southbound of the Center's porch. It took exactly one hour for every individual pass, and I managed to positively identify 12 and can be certain of only 18 of 20, but there were excellent calls recorded of J-17 and her two kids. Also nice strong echolocation clicks throughout the nearly one hour of the pass-by, and good calls from J-17 and her two kids fairly close to shore. Didn't see J-1, but haze reduced visibilty for anything more than two miles out, mid Haro Strait. The encounter ended at 1545, with whales spread out down the coast from Eagle Point to Lime-Kiln. Bye for now, Kelley

<br/><b>Comments:</b> Here's a report from Deborah Houseworth of Whidbey, about gray whale activity off the SW side of Whidbey Island:
<br/> Hi Susan! I did not want to bore the network with daily emails, but I did want to at least notify you that over the past few days there have been several grays putting in a daily appearance just south of the mouth to Cultus Bay as they proceed on a liesurely path from Possession Point, northwest past Scatchet Heaad, and then onward toward Double Bluff. They appear to be feeding as they go, judging from the way in which they roll onto their sides and move their fins about. Though I would like to think they are waving at me, I know better!

One was male, two others looked like young Orcas, and then some females. The male came close to shore. They headed south, and one breached sideways, turning to show its underside (just having seen the film on all the different positions whales jump, I can't remember what this jump is called ! There were about 3 a little further north, and about 4 around a boat that headed south. Also, just beyond the tidepools, were 2 harbor seals, one stuck its neck way up out of the water ! A heron sat at the tidepools edge for over 1/2 hour. It was quite the day !

This morning at about 7:30 am I observed a single gray well off shore between Whidbey and Hat Islands. It was meandering south taking shallow dives. Once I saw the tail lift as it went deeper and then passed beyond my view.

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Hi Susan, Don Harrison here from North Pender Island in the Gulf Islands. Our last orca siting was on April 9 ~1500-1600 hrs as we observed a pod of about 20+?? "whales" moving in a northerly direction between Salt Spring and Portland Islands. We were on land at Beaver Point on Salt Spring and watched them pass approximately 200-300 m off shore. They seemed to stop and hang around a couple of recreational vessels that had motored to the area to observe (48deg. 46.3min N, 123deg. 21.7min. N), then the pod continued northerly in the direction of Active Pass. The pod was too far off to distinguish anything significant about their markings, but there seemed to be one prominent, large dorsal fin in the group. They were surfacing in regular fashion, but off Beaver Point a few made surging motions as they surfaced, which we suspected may have been feeding. North of the 2 boats, we observed a couple of breeches? (whales leaping ~3/4 out of the water). Hope this helps.

My neighbor and I went down to the point at Fox Spit and one was just south of there, about 60 feet offshore. We sat and watched it feeding on its side for about half an hour, before it headed south towards Langley. It was a delightful whale-watching experience!!

<br/><b>Comments:</b> Susan, I'm no whale expert, so I'm sorry I can't be more sure of what I am reporting. I just saw at least two, and possibly four, whales that I think must be gray whales, apparently feeding in the eelgrass beds off my community beach. I live in Polnell Shores; the whales were in Crescent Harbor between 12:00 and 1:15 pm. Some people who were watching with me said they heard that someone had seen the whales across the water, closer to Camano Island, yesterday. I couldn't believe how close to shore they were! At one point, I think one had its lateral fin sticking out of the water for a solid 20 seconds...I imagine it was on its side, gobbling away. Kim

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Hi Susan, J-pod came south along the west side just after lunch (1300), and I managed to get good recordings on the hydrophones as well as identify nearly all the animals, particularly J-8!!!!!! I'm confident it was her, and I'm also confident baby J-37 was also alive and well, and there was lots of foraging too. There were the right number of whales too, to make me feel pretty sure that J-pod was all present and accounted for. By 4pm the whales had traveled south to Eagle Point and I lost them heading into the rain squalls, so they may be on their way south, or they may have "moved in" (one can hope). Kelley

It is hard to be precise, since they are so far out. They do not appear to be headed anywhere in particular. rather, they seem to be remaining in the same spot for quite some time (a good half hour now). The pickings must be really good out there! By the way, they are so far out that I cannot positively ID them as grays, but I am certain they are not orcas. Thanks for keeping us all up to date! Deborah Houseworth

 <br/><b>Comments:</b> Good Morning Susan! It is just after 7 am Wednesday morning, and about half an hour ago, I was awakened by the sound of steam through pipes. As I lie in bed I realized I was hearing a gray whale feeding right below off the beach at Fox Spit!!!! I called my neighbor and we drove down to the beach in time to see 2 grays headed south towards Langley at a leisurely, breakfast pace. What a nice way to wake up. Louise Salmin
