Spent a wonderful afternoon with J's in Bellingham Channel near 
Anacortes despite the rugged weather yesterday - they were 
swimming slowly against the tide and staying in the same spot for a good 
hour and a half - lots of swimming upside down and rolling around and 
yes, a few sea snakes as well! frisky youngsters i presume.

Last evening around 8:00 PM Capt Erik Schorr and Naturalist Katie Jones and guests were with J,K and L, a bit North West of San Juan Island. And boy, were they vocal last night. Capt. Erik phoned Bill and I at home. He had the cell phone near the hydrophone so that we could hear what was going on. The orcas were chattering, singing and carrying on and on and on. So much to say. What a treat. (Wish we were on that trip, but the vicarious experience was a fun one).

good morning, 
<br/>@ 4pm ... at the southend of north pender island. 
i could hear the tail slap and blow and sure enough there were two males in 
the cove and 10 or 12 Orcas farther out. 
they were milling while a small Orca breached and spy hopped. great to see 
them so close.

J and K pods were at Hannah Heights at around 11:45, heading north. They milled around between Bellevue Pt. and Sunset Pt, then went past the Center for Whale Research at 12:30. L pod was reported to be east of Victoria, heading west out the strait at 9 am, by noon they were near Sooke, still heading west.

Met up with L's at 1255 just off Open Bay and traveled with them north to Speiden; observed behaviors included breaches and tail slaps. There were quite a few commercial whale watchers and some privates as well. Weather was changing rapidly so we came back in.

On Saturday, June 22nd, we found J pod right off Snug Harbor, headed south. Went out with Ken Balcomb to see them as they went by, then went back to the dock and drove down to OrcaSing at Lime Kiln State Park, where J pod went by at around 8:45, still headed south.

Met up with J's heading south as we came out of Mitchell Bay at 1925 and traveled south with them to Deadman's Bay where the Orca Sing was going on. Moving rapidly and had several spyhops from J14, and J37 at Deadman's Bay. Didn't catch any wheeze from J1 this time.

Hi Susan ...
<br/>We met up with T14 at approximately 0700 this evening just south of D'Arcy. How big and beautiful he is!!! He was mulling southbound, taking his time with deep dives for approximately 10-15 minutes. He gradually kept moving south and then in towards shore. It was a beautiful evening and wonderful to see him. J's and K's were reported up in Samson ... but we didn't get up that far. No reports that we are aware of on the L's.
<br/>Cheers,

Hi Susan ...
<br/>At 1942 we met up with J pod just north of Lime Kiln; whales were heading south and spread out but moving along at a good pace. Appears that J1 has picked up a bit of a wheez and we definitely recognized J8!!! There were a few tail slaps along the way but for the most part they were "cruising." Also had Dall's porpoises surfing the bow, a wonderful encounter with a harbor seal doing some tail slapping and feeding and finished the evening with a beautiful bald eagle swooping down for fish.
<br/>Cheers,

Hi Susan and all the rest of you. 
<br/>A really odd day for my part of the world. Picked up Lpod going N. this morning off the Southern part of San Juan Is. 
<br/>Next came reports of Kpod ahead of the L's and later reports of J's ahead of the K's. Had a great encounter with L's , did not see any K's myself. 
<br/>Had a great encounter with L73 and Dall's Porpoise all over him. In the afternoon Lpod turned South and came through Hughes Pass and along the Van. Is. shore and on into Oak Bay and then on across the Vic.. waterfront, they should be at Race Rocks outbound as I write this. 
To the best of my knowledge J's and K's have carried on North.

At 7 P.M. Sat. evening (June 15) seven whales churned the water directly below Oak Bluffs on N. Pender Island, B.C.,  for about 20 minutes. They seemed to be feeding. Every whale behaviour was put on display. 
When they left, 2 other groups of 5 whales each went by in the same direction (N.W.)

Hi 
<br/>Well the morning was most interesting, whales coming down from Turn Pt. 
<br/>Whales going N.W. up the west side and whales in Rosario off Deception Pass.
<br/>This was all at the same time. 
<br/>It turned out to be J's and some K's coming south from Turn Pt. a number of Lpod going towards the park from the South and the rest of the K's in Rosario. 
<br/>In the afternoon they had all met and were going towards Turn Pt. 
I never saw any L12 whales maybe someone can help me out with a report? 
This afternoons encounter was simply magical.

Hi Howard and Susan! 
<br/>Spent the day in the midst of a wonderful superpod off of American Camp. We followed K pod as they met up with J's and L's coming south. 
It was a fabulous afternoon. All of the whale watch boats were "dead stop" in the water and the few private boaters were obviously savvy as they did the same. 
<br/>The whales just were totally into each other and the best part we were fortunate enough to see was young Cappuccino trying very hard to romance a female into accepting his advances. There is no telling if she finally did, but we saw lots of Cappuccino that we don't usually see....twice we saw her roll onto her back and lift her ventral side into the air...I suppose to avoid his more amorous advances. Poor guy, I guess he is not old enough yet, or maybe he was....Jeremy got some good video and hopefully we will be able to ID the female.

<br/><br/>A report on A73 from Sunday, June 9:
<br/>Susan and Howard,
<br/>I was on the ferry this morning around 11:30am.. and got 
to see A73 Springer for my first time finally! She was 
hanging out at the stern of the docked "Evergreen 
State". She was mostly just lounging there, and doing a 
couple rolls, waving her pecs, and what seemed to be 
rubbing against the stern of the ferry. But that was all. Got some pics... she sure is loved by many who 
saw her. Definitely heard alot of concern about the fate 
of our S. Residents as well. We were heading into 
SouthWorth so we got to see her a little bit longer then 
when you just take the Vashon ferry.

Two guests in my B&amp;B on Maury Island (south Sound, near Vashon Isl.) 
reported to me this morning that they had seen a mom and babe orca at Point Robinson, June 8. Seems like an unlikely timing for orcas to be here. Anyone else see them?

And Shane Aggergaard called in an update to June 8th's report - K pod went up the west side of San Juan Island in the afternoon, turning around at Lime Kiln, at Bird Rock at 6pm, and at 7:30 - 8 pm met up with J pod at Salmon Bank (so. San Juan Isl.)
<br/>*<br/>
And another Sea Otter report from Kathy Fletcher:
Hi Susan--
A friend of mine who lives on the Sound between Seattle and Tacoma 
said that they had a SEA otter in their area for quite some time. I tried 
to convince her that it must have been a river otter, but she knows her 
stuff, and is very sure. She said that others, including wildlife agency 
folks were also sure. So maybe it's time to do a definitive report on who 
has seen what sea otters when and where in the Sound.--Kathy

Hi there,
<br/>I wanted to add to the glowing reports of the superpod on June 8th. We were hanging out with K pod until they met up with J and L near American Camp, and then the fun began. We witnessed some of the same behavior from Cappuccino, and I'm hoping we got a good identification photo of the female he was romancing. Vicki, we'll have to compare notes and photos. As for Ron's question about L12's, we did see them hanging around our boat for awhile before they moved away, so they were definitely present. I was also encouraged by the behavior of the boaters. I heard very few motors running and it appeared as if the whales were being given plenty of room to do their thing. It was a great day.

Some of L Pod off the southern tip of Henry Is. feeding on the surface. By 8:00 
AM they were moving south toward Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Thanks to Ross 
Brown.
<br/>In the past few weeks I have been seeing great numbers of small salmon 
working the surface of the water off the west side of San Juan Island. 
More than I have ever seen before at this time of the year. It's a good 
thing, Martha!

Howie &amp; I spent the afternoon at the Center for Whale Research on Friday, and
were treated to J &amp; K pods doing the west side shuffle! At approx. 2 pm, K pod went 
north past the Center, then turned around &amp; headed back south. At 4 pm J &amp; K pods 
both were headed north past the Center. No further reports on L's travels....

Hi Susan, 
<br/>Very exciting news from our evening whale-watch yesterday (6/6 on the 
Mercury) - 
we stopped at Viti Rocks (just south of Lummi Island) to see the harbor 
seals - one of the passengers 
cried out, "Look it's a sea otter!" And just as I started into my 
schpeil about how we don't have sea otters in here but we do have river 
otters.....I looked thru the binoculars and lo and behold - it WAS a sea otter!! White whiskery face, big body, lolling about on its back in the 
kelp staring at us with its forepaws up in the air - I've seen a lot of 
sea otters in my time, in Alaska and Monterey - as well as many river 
otters in this area. As far as I've read, there haven't been any 
sightings this far inside for many years - I've heard there is a 
population on the outer coast of 
Washington and some have made their way into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
<br/>I'm so excited about this discovery - have you gotten any other reports 
from this area? I'd be very curious to know. 
Once again, nature teaches us - Never say never.....!! 
<br/>Best regards,
<br/>Penny Stone

Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group in Victoria reported L pod on the west side of San Juan Island going south to False Bay in the morning, then turning north and doing the "west side shuffle" along the west side all afternoon. 
<br/>Orcas were also reported at 3 pm going north around Lopez Island (J's or K's?), and on Tuesday, June 4th, orcas were reported milling off the west side of Vancouver - maybe Offshores?
<br/>*<br/>
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures also reported L pod off the west side of San Juan Island.

And we had the pleasure of being out with K pod in the afternoon yesterday with Island Adventures. They were along the west side of San Juan Island, in the Hannah Heights to False Bay areas. They were very active and wonderful to watch - a cartwheel, several tail slaps, some great spy-hops, and lots of milling back &amp; forth.
