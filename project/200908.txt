<b>August 31, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
While at anchor on the east side of <b>Eagle Island WA</b> (near Olympia), we had a FANTASTIC up-close-and-personal show by <b>4 Orcas</b> around <b>5:00pm to 5:30pm</b>. All orcas certainly looked healthy. We think one in the group looked smaller than the other three. We observed what we think was feeding as the seals are certainly abundant on the island. We watched as they dove as a group, and at times, only one orca jumping at a time, but always re-grouping !!!! ABSOLUTELY fascinating !!!!!! They continued to swim south through Balch Passage towards Dana Point. We hope this information is helpful. We feel so very, very lucky to have observed these beautiful creatures !!!
<br/>Sue and Jon Duncan 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 orcas</b> were observed between <b>Gig Harbor and Vashon Island WA</b> (47 deg 21' 23" N , 122 deg 32' 23"W), about <b>1:30 pm</b>. They were traveling south, feeding. 
<br/>Casey Coffman 
<br/>*<br/>
A great treat today around <b>4:30</b> to watch from our shoreline about <b>25 orcas</b> head east through <b>Active Pass</b>. They were moving in small groups of 2 - 5, very spread out. Some tail slaps, body rolls, and breaches. Some big splashing about in some kelp beds. Sideways swimming under the water just in front of us. J pod? 
<br/>Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, BC 
<br/><i>From Karoline's photos, we have ID'd members of both J and L pods - sb </i>
<br/>*<br/>
I have to say the <b>Grey whales</b> off of <b>Jetty Island</b> (Everett WA) must be quite happy to be there. We sailed up to Fort Flagler and saw them again in the shallows next to the day shape off of Jetty Island.
<br/>Doug Barlow 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 Transient Orcas </b>were at the south end of <b>Vashon Island</b>. It looks like others saw them. A small rental boat from Pt. Defiance was following them.
<br/>Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa. 
<br/>*<br/>
With so many salmon in the area, it's no surprise that the whales don't seem to be in a hurry to go away. Today we started the day on the west side with sunny skies, while the eastern side of San Juan and the Strait of Juan de Fuca were pretty socked in with fog. I watched from shore as purse seiner after purse seiner plied the west side of San Juan in search of salmon. But they had plenty of competition as whales from J Pod, K Pod, and L Pod worked the same currents as the fishermen. By <b>afternoon</b>, it was time for us to leave the dock, and we had a choice of seeing the <b>L2s and L12s</b> down at <b>Hannah Heights</b>, or go north towards <b>Turn Point</b> and see <b>Js, Ks and the rest of Ls</b>. No brainer to me--so off we went up north. The whales were traveling a bit more slowly at this point, so it gave me plenty of time to talk about orca life histories, feeding patterns, and of course the guidelines. Soon the first whales were close enough to ID, and it was none other than K21 Cappucino and K40 Raggedy. Soon there were dozens of dorsal fins at the surface as the first half of J Pod swam by. J1 Ruffles in close attendance to mom J2 Granny. J30 Riptide playing with his family. J22 Oreo and her sprouting son J34 Double Stuff. It was great to see the family close together and rolling around on top of each other, swimming upside down, tail slapping. Soon a spyhop had our passengers oohing and ahhing, a perfect segueway to what the behavior was and why we think they do it. As Ruffles came to the surface again, someone asked about him breaching, and I said I had only seen him breach 4 times in the last 13 years. Well, he must have heard me and thought it was time for number 5, as he breached right after the comment! 
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J, K, and some L pod</b> members were all traveling together this afternoon! Somewhat of a superpod. (Other members of L pod were at the south end of San Juan Island today). They had been moving along to the north, when we arrived in <b>Swanson Channel</b>, a waterway in the Gulf Islands they were just slowing down and gathering together. We watched a big group with lots of whales all busy socializing! Amongst the group were J26, J33, 2 year-old J42, J19 &amp; calf J41, L72, K12, K22 along with many others. Somewhat of a little happy hour - lots of activity at the surface: tail slaps, rolling over, pec slaps, half breaches, cartwheels. It was awesome.

<b>11:15 am</b> - Hearing calls on <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b>. 
<br/>Cathy Bacon, Texas
<br/>*<br/>
Loud clear <b>calls </b>and echolocation from <b>Lime Kiln</b> - I began hearing at <b>10:48 a.m.</b>.
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Key Largo, FL 
<br/>*<br/>
We watched <b>orcas </b>off <b>Hannah Heights</b> from <b>9:30 - 10:45 am</b>, spread out &amp; foraging with a few direction changes, but heading north through the fishing fleet. Through photos &amp; confirmation from the Ctr. for Whale Research, we found it was <b>Js, Ks &amp; part of L's</b> in this first group. At <b>11:40 am</b>, another smaller pod passed by heading north, later ID'd as the <b>L12s</b>. From <b>2 - 3:30 pm</b>, small pods of orcas came by heading south (L12s &amp; L2s), some closer in and some quite far out. At <b>5 pm</b>, we watched the smaller pods pass by again heading north, most of them further offshore. What a treat to get to have a few quiet days on San Juan Island watching the whales go by!
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called Orca Network at <b>11:30 am</b> to relay a report she had heard of <b>3 orcas</b> near Talequa. She headed out to find them, calling back at noon to report observing 4 - 6 <b>Transient </b>orcas just off Camp Sealth, coming up <b>Colvos Passage</b>. At 2 pm they were off the south end of Vashon Island - she watched them off the Lisa Beula area as they went back &amp; forth between Vashon &amp; the Kitsap Peninsula, then head south on the Kitsap side. At <b>2:24 pm</b> she was watching from S. Vashon Island as they headed south on the far Kitsap side, out of sight. 
<br/>*<br/>
We just (<b>12:50</b>) got a call from D. James of Olympia area who is watching four <b>killer whales</b> travel east from Eld Inlet into Dana Passage. The whales were porpoising and diving, and there were salmon leaping in the general area. 
<br/>Annie Douglas, Cascadia Research, Olympia

<br/><br/>
There were some incredible <b>vocalizations </b>today. The orcas must have been close to the lighthouse as they were quite loud.
<br/>Carole May, Bellingham
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0157 </b>PDT - <b>Orca </b>at <b>Lime Kilm hydrophones</b>.
<br/>Lon Brocklehurst 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:34 am</b> - Starting to hear <b>calls </b>on <b>lime Kiln Hps</b>. <b>11:52</b> - Calls starting to get louder and possilby closer. Sounds like some S1 calls. 
<br/>Cathy Bacon, Texas 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>spread out south of <b>Hannah Heights</b> at <b>3:45 pm</b>. We thought they were headed our way, but they headed south. We also observed many Harbor and Dall's porpoise off Hannah Heights all three days we were on SJI (8/30 &amp; 31 &amp; 9/1).
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
We were out on the water just outside <b>Shilshole </b>marina in Seattle and we saw <b>marine mammals</b> I could not identify. They were small- much smaller than orcas- (more like the size of belugas), dark in color, and they had a small "nubbin" on their backs rather than a true fin. We saw a tail at one point so we knew they weren't seals rolling around in the water. We saw them multiple times out in the water past the marina, and off the coast of Discovery park. Do you know what they were? I have been searching online for fin identification photos to figure this out, but have been unable to solve the mystery. I studied whale phonations in college so I do have some knowledge, but this has me stumped! 
<br/>Erica Vanaja 
<br/>*<br/>
There were <b>I15s</b> in <b>Johnstone Strait</b>. At <b>noon</b>, they were moving from the bight to West Cracroft Island. We've also seen a large group of dolphins, around Kelsey bay.

<br/><br/>
I don't know if it was the early evening light or if this was the most beautiful <b>Minke Whale</b> on the planet - but anyway, a Minke surfaced three times off <b>Marrowstone Point</b> about 75 yards out last night about <b>6 p.m</b>. Absolutely magnificent animal. Its back was so sleek and unmarked and the dorsal was so tall and curved, elegantly. The second time up it showed a lot of its face too. Crisp white along the throat. Lots of sandlance and herring around for them now!
<br/>Ron Hirschi, Marrowstone Island 
<br/>*<br/>
I first saw this <b>Humpback </b>Whale in <b>Monterey Bay CA</b> last year; this year she's back with a calf! Thought you might be interested due to the marks on her flukes that I assume are from Orca teeth. We don't hear about much interaction between these two species in this area, so I don't know whether it was our local transients or some that she met between here and her breeding grounds in Central America.
<br/>Steve Johnston, Senior Guest Experience Trainer, Monterey Bay Aquarium 
<br/>*<br/>
I listened to <b>Southern Residents</b> on the <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b> from <b>11:30 am to just after 12:30 pm</b>. I never heard anything on the OrcaSound hydrophone further north, and heard the whales were heading south.
<br/>Susan Berta, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1100 am</b> -- <b>Lime Kilm hydrophone</b>, hearing <b>Orca </b>calls. <b>1245 </b>.
<br/>RoboLON 
<br/>*<br/>
John McKenzie called Orca Network to report <b>4 orcas</b> just outside of <b>Sequim Bay</b> today at <b>1420</b>. He was kayaking, and the whales circled the kayaks for about 20 minutes, appearing to be feeding, then headed east toward Discovery Bay. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>T14 </b>was in <b>Campbell River</b>, he spent some time next to the shore. Transients are here.
<br/>Florent Nicolas 
<br/>*<br/>
Mac LaMay of Whidbey Island called to report one <b>Gray whale</b> between <b>Hat/Gedney Island</b> and Everett, in about 15' of water at <b>2:20 pm</b>. It appeared to be feeding. 
<br/><br/>
<b>August 28, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>K-Pod</b> spread from <b>Eagle Point</b> out over Salmon Bank, slowly foraging individually and in groups of 2 to 4, from about <b>2:30 to 3:30pm</b>. With slack flood tide the whales seem to be meandering back and forth, first heading northwest, then southeast, as they swept the area on long dives, almost synchronizing their surfacings. We observed K-21 Cappuccino with his older sister K-40 Raggedy not far behind. K-13 Skagit, and family K-25 Scoter, K-27 Deadhead, and K-34 Cali, stuck close together in somewhat of a resting pattern, yet taking those long dives. We were able to listen to intermittent vocalizations. Flat water, overcast skies, and the mellow whales set the tone for a relaxed trip. The rest of K-Pod was heading back toward San Juan Island.
<br/>Caroline Armon, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
A complete surprise while on our way into Vancouver via the Victoria to Vancouver Adventure crossing with Prince of Whales; <b>Jpod </b>was fishing near the north arm of the <b>Fraser River</b> around <b>7:30pm</b>. Here, J27 and younger sibling J39 are showing communication and/or foraging behavior; tail slaps, pec slaps, even a breach!. You can see that Mako J39 copies what his big brother Blackberry J27 is doing and that they are a team!. It's a heart warming observation to see the two together in this way. I was thinking about them all night! A video of that event can be found <a href="http://www.orcanation.com/2009/09/j39-j27/"><b>here</b></a>. 
<br/>Maria Chantelle Tucker, Victoria B.C.
<br/><i>We HIGHLY RECOMMEND viewing it - it truly captures J39 learning from his older brother! sb</i>
<br/>*<br/>
Here is some news from Campbell River, few <b>Transients </b>(5, one big male : may be T10B)- North Quadra Island (Rock Bay - Elk Bay). Moving to the south, looking for food ! (There were also some sea lions, and Pacific white sided dolphin - small group).
<br/>Florent Nicolas 
<br/>*<br/>
2 nautical miles east of Providence Cove on Vancouver Is (<b>juan de fuca</b>) 1/8 mile off the beach at <b>10:30am</b> we spotted a single large male <b>Orca </b>moving fast eastward. We are just completing a circumnavigation of Van Is and this is the first Orca we have seen since being on the outside. We have however seen several Humpback and Minke along the way as well as countless sealions and several large rafts of sea otters!

My name is David Kirner, Marine Technician and Research Vessel captain for Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. We were transiting from Port Angeles to La Push and spotted 1 sub-adult &amp; 2 possibly 3 juvenile <b>orcas </b>just off <b>Crescent Bay</b> about 3 - 4 miles out. The sub-adult looked to be female (shorter, more rounded dorsal), while the juveniles were small enough to be this year's calves. They did not seem to be in any hurry, in tight formation, transiting in a westward direction, from approximately <b>7:30 - 8:00 am</b>. The saddle patches I did notice were more gray in color rather than brilliant white. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>heard on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone</b> system <b>2325 </b>PDT.
<br/>Lon Brockelhurst 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>All three pods</b> were spread apart when we first saw them just south of <b>active pass</b>, but once they all went through the pass it was incredible to watch so many whales going through the little pass! We got spoiled with lots of breaches, slaps and spyhops. 
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver 
<br/>*<br/>
Today had two interesting occurrences that I wanted to share. Early this morning we had <b>all three pods</b> spread along <b>San Juan Island</b>. They were rocketing up the west side amongst the many private fishing boats and the commercial fishing boats that were jockeying for position to set out their nets. Soon the lead whales were long out of sight, leaving us with members of the L2s and L12s. Two interesting observations-- this group of approximately 10 whales spent the ENTIRE DAY in a very tight group, traveling at what would be called a resting pattern. It went on for over 8 hours. They would surface for 3-5 breaths, and then down they'd go for upwards of 5 minutes. I can't recall the last time I saw an extended resting pattern like this.
The second interesting occurrence was that while J Pod, K Pod and most of L Pod went up Swanson Channel and into Active Pass, the L2s and L12s actually went up Swanson Çhannel and made a sharp right into Navy Channel! I have no recollection of residents doing this for at least the last 13 years I've been on the water. They pretty much maintained the tight grouping, and once they went South into Plumper Sound (between Saturna &amp; Pender Islands), they did 4 direction changes (during which time they spread out to about 100 yards before coalescing back together &amp; these changes were usually preceded by a spyhop or two). For over 2 hours they were in Plumper Sound, and only the fading light and late hour forced our departure.
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist &amp; Soundwatch Volunteer 
<br/>*<br/>
We came across the <b>L12s and maybe L22s</b> today in <b>Swanson Channel</b>. These were the trailers, with the rest of the residents spread out to<b> Active Pass</b>. The orcas were closely grouped together and slowly traveling up North Pender Island with little to no apparent feeding going on.
<br/>Tristen Joy, Naturalist, Crew At San Juan Safaris Whale Watch Wildlife Tours 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Perry Edwards on board the Salt Chuck out of N. Vancouver, reporting "orcas everywhere!" heading north past west <b>San Juan Island</b> &amp; spread out north of Henry Island (48 37.145; 123 12.709) at <b>10:50 am</b>. It was <b>all 3 Southern Resident pods</b> - some headed east into Spieden and some west west of Stuart Island into Boundary Pass. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:26 am</b> - Starting to hear <b>calls </b>on the <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophone</b>, S1 calls.
<br/>Cathy Bacon, Texas 
<br/>*<br/>
I was skirting the tide flat off of Jetty Island (near <b>Everett</b>) and thought I would need to tack as I saw a huge wash to leeward. I could not believe it when I saw a huge [<b>gray</b>] whale wallowing in the very shallow water spouting. There were two separated by the shallows of the sandbar in the center of the tide flat. I hope they are OK as the tide was due to head out.

<br/><br/>
Nice to see <b>J-Pod</b> off of <b>False Bay</b> from <b>2:17pm to 3:25pm</b>. J-2 Granny once again in the lead as she headed offshore toward the southwest, with J-1 Ruffles following. The rest of J-Pod were spread in a line between them and the shoreline, foraging. Not much of an ebbing tide, they seemed to circle back and we realized there were some K-Pod whales with them. Whales rolling over each other and quite a bit of tactile behavior- mating?! The first Northern Phalaropes of the season gathered at the surface too.
<br/>Caroline Armon, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:30 am.</b> <b>Minke </b>and many porpoi slowly heading north toward Pt. Partridge ~ 1 mile out.
<br/>Al Luneman, Coupeville, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Had Transient orcas <b>T041, T041A, T060's, T02B, T036, and T099's</b> again today except this time all together. They were first spotted north east of <b>Race Rocks</b> in the <b>morning </b>and last seen south of <b>Discovery Island</b> early <b>afternoon</b>.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria BC 
<br/>*<br/>
A few <b>residents </b>(I believe) eastbound near <b>Constance Bank</b> (<b>1800hrs</b>). The whales carried on past headed towards the south end of San Juan Island. 
<br/>Keith Provan
<br/>*<br/>
We met up with members from <b>J, K and L pods</b> off of <b>False Bay</b> (W. San Juan Isl). The J pod males were there, along with either L7 "Canuck" or L77 "Matia", and as we left the area we saw K40 "Raggedy" and K21 "Cappuccino" heading east with some others. All-in-all there was quite a large number of orcas in the area.
<br/>Tristen Joy, Naturalist, Crew At San Juan Safaris Whale Watch Wildlife Tours
<br/>*<br/>
We found <b>K pod</b> off of <b>point roberts</b>. They were vocalizing like crazy! We had breaches, spyhops, tail slaps and lots of foraging!
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
<br/>*<br/>
Just saw a male and a female <b>orca </b>just off <b>Edith Point, Mayne Island</b> heding east - feeding I think just off the reef there off Campbell Bay, <b>10 am</b>. They were circling and diving then coming up and repeating that. for about 15 minutes then headed south past Georgeson Island. 
<br/>Catherine Clarke
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:01 am:</b> Hearing faint <b>calls </b>on <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>. <b>8:38 am:</b> Very loud calls being heard on Lime Kiln hydrophones. I have heard a few clear S1 calls, assuming Jpod is passing by the lighthouse. 
<br/>Cathy Bacon, Texas
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orca </b>at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> <b>7:40 am.</b> Ship noise 7 to 9 (-20db to -30db). I am still hearing Orcas @ 0800. They are comming - Sea noise 3 @ -63db high.

We were on a charter with Deer Harbor Charters. The vessel was trying hard to catch up to a 'resident' <b>pod </b>that was reported to be <b>between Patos Island and Point Roberts</b> and heading north. Around <b>15:00</b> a 'blow' was sighted to the west (and appeared heading south) and the vessel headed toward it. The whale pod, identified by Natalie as a <b>transient </b>pod of about 3 or 4 whales, ended up north of the vessel, and was actually heading east (ultimately along the north shore of Patos). The pod seemed like they followed or chased something into a slight 'cove' formed by a 'hook' peninsula on the north shore of Patos (the whales were heading east into the 'mouth' of the 'cove'). They lingered and swam around there for a while.

Dripping wet fog in the Strait of Juan de Fuca echoed the breathing of <b>Orcas </b>working the flooding tide from <b>Hein Bank</b> toward False Bay, long before we saw them! We carefully made our way off of Eagle Point and shut down from about <b>3:00pm to 3:30pm</b> to listen for and watch some L-Pod whales pass through the thick marine layer that only gave limited visibility. L-72 Racer's unique saddle patch made for easy identification from a distance, as she swam in and out of the fog. Although we didn't see them, hearing J-Pod calls through the hydrophone along with the powerful exhalations of all the whales out there, gave us a glimpse into their acoustically oriented world.

I have an <b>orca </b>report from a fishing friend who was on <b>Marrowstone Point</b> around <b>8 a.m</b>. when he saw <b>four orcas</b> just off the point. Based on size, he thought it was two adults and two calves. The whales swam directly at the tip of the point where Steve and another fisherman were up to their waists, casting for salmon. Steve got out of the water on seeing bubbles close to shore, "well within casting distance" - -- which would be about sixty feet for our light gear.

Residents have returned to our waterways! After 2 days in the Strait and ocean, members of the fish-eating <b>Orca </b>community have made their way back towards <b>San Juan Island</b>. One whale spyhopped twice taking a peak above the water. With the hydrophone in we were able to hear more echolocation and vocalizations. The Orcas were lost again in the fog, when we were graced with views of at least a dozen Orcas - lots of directional changes, they seemed to be fishing (we saw several salmon jump throughout the afternoon). I was able to ID J28 in the mix with several L pod members. L72 with her 5-year-old son L105 and and his uncle L95 were amongst the Orcas.

At <b>7:14 pm</b> he spotted the <b>orcas </b>from <b>Lagoon Pt</b>, just south and about a mile out. He was able to see the male's fin, and a glimpse of another fin or two, but then a fog bank rolled in and they were no longer visible, so unfortunately no photos or ID's could be obtained.

Between <b>12:45 and 1:00pm</b>, about 18 <b>orcas </b>passed <b>East Point, Saturna Island</b> in Boundary Pass heading west. All the whales that I could ID were members of J-pod. They arrived at Boiling Reef just at the beginning of flood tide, and by the time they were just north of Skipjack Island, the current was already quite strong against them. They were clearly struggling to make headway. 6 whales including one adult male abandoned the main channel and headed back towards Saturna's shore where they could avoid the strong currents by swimming in the tidal shadow created by Monarch Head. They travelled all the way to the Narvaez Bay before making a left turn and heading south, slowing briefly to do some breaching and tail lobbing before re-entering the currents of <b>Boundary Pass</b> to meet up with the others. It was about 2:10pm before the stragglers reached Taylor's Point and went out of sight.

At <b>1700 </b>some <b>Ls </b>and what looked like Raggedy K40 (I have seen her many times over the years swimming with those L males) were heading North from <b>East Point to Point Roberts</b>. They stopped many times along the way to play and socialize. L78 had a fresh wound about the shape of a 12 inch ruler below the two "rakes" that were previously reported. Another male had two maybe three long thin marks that went nearly right across the dorsal fin. The orcas were off the park at sunset.

A <b>superpod</b> of Southern Resident <b>Orcas </b>passed by <b>East Point Saturna Island</b> between <b>5:20 and 6:15pm</b>, heading west in Boundary Pass. Beginning with with about 10-12 K's and J's, then a second wave of mostly J's and ending with a third wave of mostly L's, there appeared to be a least 50 whales in total, possibly more. L2's and J2's identified, as well as K12 and K13 among other positive IDs. In contrast to recent weeks, they put on an amazingly energetic display, with so many percussive demonstrations going on that we were overwhelmed with the sound of whale bodies hitting the water from every direction. At it's most intense, there were up to five whales breaching simultaneously, and this continued along with tail lobbing and pec slapping until the last of them were out of sight around the Java Islets, at approximately 7pm. Along the way, there was a lot of back- tracking and cutting across the east-west flow, and much milling around when they reached Monarch Head near the mouth of Narvaez Bay.

They were spread out several miles wide and it took about 45 minutes for all of them to go by. They were very active with spyhopping, speedswimming, tail slaps and breaches. The most interesting thing that I saw was a very tight family of approximately 9 orcas swimming so close together that they were almost touching while all of the others were in spread out.

Sunday <b>evening</b>. The majority of all 3 pods of <b>Orcas </b>had been at the Fraser River all day, presumably feeding on salmon migrating back to their spawning grounds. Although the whales had changed from a southbound direction to more of an eastbound one - <b>towards Blaine</b>, Washington we made it! The Resident Orcas were spread out, the water was glassy so you could see their blows a mile or 2 out! The lowering sun glistened on their black dorsal fins. We were shut down, as mother K22 (Sekiu) and her son, K33 (Tika) swam off our port bow, then double-backed in the opposite direction. We dropped the hydrophone in at one point and the Orcas were busy vocalizing! There was a possible J pod female traveling with K22 &amp; K33. The occasional breach in the distance could be seen &amp; heard - blubber on water - there's no other sound quite like it! We turned to start heading home, and stopped to get a great look at L41 (Mega) and his grandmom L12 (Alexis).

Members of <b>all three pods</b> were heading south- in resting lines heading directly into the kelp beds. Just as the first row of J pod approached, I believe it was Granny who double breached right before our eyes. The line stayed in formation however, passing directly along the shorelines. The next line of resting whales was replete with lots of big fins- the younger boys were following suit and passed again, right on the shores. The show was not over, we had Cappuccino and Raggedy pass along with lots of K Pod whales, intermingled with L's- all right at the shoreline. One mother passed by holding her youngster above the water on her rostrum- lots of rolling and play in general. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience today.

Capt. Peter, Ashley and I spent the <b>afternoon </b>with "Spirit" and her boys today. A mother's love and authority are never in question and L22 gave a great demonstration of that. All was quiet and calm when we first arrived on scene. <b>L79 </b>"Skana" was doing his own thing and <b>L22 </b>"Spirit" was within sight, for us humans, but in her own space away from her son. They were moving at an exaggeratedly slow pace and "Skana" was above water for so long each time that he blew that we could see the small nick in the tip of his dorsal fin. The dives were long and there were some direction changes, but for the most part they seemed to be drifting with the currents. Rather suddenly though, "Skana" and "Spirit" changed direction and sped up. They moved in side-by-side and were definitely traveling northwest. As we motored along trying to keep up, we were surprised by another male orca that popped up right behind us. Nobody had seen him up until then. It was <b>L85 </b>"Mystery". He quickly joined the others, but then there was another and another! Suddenly we were watching a family of 5 <b>orcas </b>moving quickly through the waters on there way to somewhere important. It is of course unclear to those of us above water how the decision to change direction and speed was made, much less who made it. But once the word went out, all of the family responded. With our resident orcas living in a matriarchal society, it makes sense that "Spirit" is the one that decides the who, how, when and where. It may be more diplomatic than that, but the decision was obviously agreed upon and/or followed by all involved. We finally said goodbye to this proud family and wended our way back to Friday Harbor. Once at the dock we unloaded other proud families that had made many memories today as well as a connection with an intelligent and devoted species of the earth.

Another flat calm, slack high tide, hardly any following ebb, sunny summer day out on the (pond like) Strait of Juan de Fuca. From <b>2:27pm to 3:39pm</b> we watched <b>L-Pod</b> whales actively forage <b>Hein Bank</b>. L-12 Alexis with L-22 Spirit, L-87 Onyx, L-89 Solstice, L-78 Gaia, and the L-5's! Many directional changes, lunges, and what seemed to be a push up- an orca came up in a vertical slant out of the water with its pectoral fins spread out and down, while we expected a breach, the whale gracefully slid back under!

I went out on <b>Monterey Bay</b> with Sanctuary Cruises. We followed 3 of what I assume are the <b>CA transient</b> group for quite a while. One of them seemed to have some recent significant damage to the dorsal, so much that we couldn't be sure whether it was male or female (see photo). Looking at the photo, I'd guess female from the curve in the front edge.

I'm happy to share this report from <b>Monterey</b>, for what it's worth. We were on Monterey Bay Whale Watch's morning cruise. We did see about<b> 25 humpbacks</b> and <b>6-8 transient orcas</b>, which was the first orca sighing there in a couple of weeks. The humpbacks were mostly feeding uneventfully on the abundant small marine life at the surface, displacing many feeding birds as they surfaced. We saw some nice flukes when they dove quite near the boat. The orcas seemed to be in 2-3 small groups of one male and a couple of females, at some distance from us and not particularly active. We were also treated to several hundred <b>Risso's dolphins</b> surrounding us as we returned, breaching, cartwheeling and seemingly playing among the sailboats and kayaks just outside the harbor.

Orca Network received a call from Jerry, reporting watching a superpod of <b>80+ orcas</b> for 4 hours off Saturna Island - orcas arrived from several directions over several hours, and at <b>7 pm</b> they all met off the Saturna Island Lighthouse, with much surface activity &amp; partying going on!
<br/>*<br/>
About <b>25 Orcas</b> travelling west in Boundary Pass made <b>Monarch Head</b> off Saturna Island between <b>6:15pm and 6:45pm</b>. The water was choppy with white caps and they were well offshore, so the count is a rough estimate -- may have been more. The whales were widely disbursed -- many solitary whales, with a number of small groups centered around mature females, including the lead group of four which appeared to be foraging around the cove at Taylor's Point on Saturna Island. One young whale, travelling alone, was doing a lot of porpoising, and another, serial breaching as it approached Monarch Head.

<br/>*<br/>
So excited to see a large group <b>(30 plus) of Orcas</b> off <b>Point Roberts</b> between <b>2 and 3 pm</b>. The whales were travelling swiftly, quite spread out, and heading south with some back and forth movement. There were at least 5 large males present; perhaps a Superpod of J, K, and L?!

<br/>*<br/>
The <b>orcas </b>were near <b>Point Roberts</b>. I was really excited; we were seeing our resident orcas. (Resident orcas are the fish eating killer whales). There were around 40 animals, but it was hard to tell since they were spread out over a few miles. We had some great visuals. They seemed to be fishing and then playing. Some guests snapped some amazing pictures of tail slapping and spy hopping. We just watched and listened for about 30 minutes. On the way back home, it almost seemed as if the whales were following us. They trailed behind us a good portion of the way back.

August 14 5:50 am - Hearing a few calls and a tremendous amount of echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone. Wish I was observing behavior right now - are they fishing/hunting?
<br/>Suzy Roebling
Suzy's question about the whales' behaviors yesterday morning answered my question about the whales' sounds over the hydrophones during the same time. I was watching the [<b>orcas</b>] at Lime Kiln starting at about <b>5:30 a.m</b>., but I was unable to hear them because the radio was not broadcasting. I was wondering about what I might be missing on the hydrophones - so thanks to Suzy now I know! The whales were moving north pretty much at a steady pace. They were spread for miles across the strait, mainly individuals or ones and twos. There were no surface behaviors that I observed other than surfacing to breathe. A few came in close to shore and again they were moving at a steady pace. Then there was a lull, during which time two came by, then one individual. Others were approaching from the south. Then (it was a little after <b>9a.m.</b>) all of a sudden there was Cappuccino right in front of me! He changed direction several times, appeared to be foraging, before he continued north. By this time the hydrophone was broadcasting at Lime Kiln, so I was able to hear him and the others who were way to the south. Those who were to the south turned and went back south.

The <b>T18's</b> were seen this am at <b>10.30.</b> I was on the 9 am Zodiac out of Victoria. Mark Malleson ID this foursome. Apparently they have been hanging out in this area for four days now. We caught up with these <b>Transients </b>off <b>Moresby and Coal Island</b>, near Swartz Bay. I have included a pic of T 19B (cropped), the male with an unusual, broad based Dorsal Fin.

I saw a <b>large whale</b> while sailing about three miles north of <b>Protection Island</b>. It had a fairly small and slightly hooked dorsal fin set well back, and a distinct gray collar. It was considerably bigger than the minke whales I have seen around here. It never showed flukes but did blow visibly. I have seen humpbacks in the past and I'm pretty sure it wasn't one. I watched it surface and dive several times and never saw flippers, or flukes. Its behavior was very much like fin and minke whales I have seen before. It's hard to estimate length but it was a lot bigger than any orca I have seen, and maybe around 50 feet. It seemed to be cruising around in the shipping lanes.

After receiving the report below about <b>orcas </b>in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, we headed over to the west side of Whidbey Island to try to find them. At 7:05 pm we watched many Harbor porpoise feeding off Bush Pt, then at <b>7:15 pm</b> we finally spotted a large fin &amp; several small ones way across the inlet, just SE of Foulweather bluff. They were slowly working their way NW, with some direction changes &amp; likely hunting behaviors noted. We saw <b>4 orcas</b> total, including 1 adult male and a juvenile or calf. They remained on the other side of the inlet, but from our distant photos, Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research made a tentative/possible ID of the bull as T10B, based on fin shape. We watched the pod continue NW for an hour, at 8:15 pm they were nearing the SE end of Fort Flagler, still heading out.

At around <b>2:00pm </b>I saw a couple of whale boats in <b>Boundary Pass </b>off Saturna Island, but no whales. After about five minutes, four <b>Orcas </b>surfaced, an adult and three juveniles. After watching a while longer, I decided they must be transients, based on their diving/surfacing pattern -- dive for 2-3 minutes, surface together for three breaths, repeat. They did this for close to an hour, drifting towards the west, coming up unpredictably and swimming in all directions. At around 2:20, they dove for at least 10 minutes, but then surprisingly surfaced again right in the middle of the accumulating whale watch boats. I believe I've seen the adult before, a male with a very large wide dorsal that droops markedly to the left. By 3:00pm, they drifted out of sight at Taylor's Point on Saturna Island, still moving west.

<b>Transient killer whales T-19 and T-19B</b> with another sprouting? male and female hunting for harbor seals around Java Rocks off of <b>Saturna Island</b>, Canada, from <b>2:37pm to 3:32pm</b>. Slack ebb tide made for pond like conditions. The four whales circled the rocks several times, while the harbor seals on land were on alert with backs arched, some going for higher ground! There were seals in the water looking nervously about. They did make some sudden turns and lunges, underwater kills? At the west end of the rocks, T-19B paused sideways while the other 3 whales rapidly came toward him, a few lunges, one showed it's flukes, then a few tails lobs, before they headed northwest towards Saturna. T-19B's dorsal fin looks so big and heavy, growing faster than the rest of him, the weight of it leaning left, and he is only 14 years old- he's going to be huge at full maturity!!

This afternoon, another boat had spotted the <b>Transient Orcas</b>! We had a feeling they must be out somewhere, with the Residents miles and miles away. Generally when the fish-eating (resident) Orcas of J, K, L pods are out of range, then there are mammal-hunting (transient) Orcas in the neighborhood. Known as the<b> T19s</b> this group was out in Canadian waters. When we arrived they were "resting" (the term used for Orca sleep). Slow synchronized dives in a tight knit group. As they neared some rocks the small group split up, circling around and around. There were a lot of harbor seals resting just above the water's edge as well as a few unsuspecting seals in the water. If they did indeed feed, then they were quite graceful about it because we never noticed any sudden dives or charges below to grab a seal. The transients then continued on their way, back in a tight group hugging the shoreline.

I was lucky to see many members of the <b>Southern Resident Orca</b> heading out west this morning. I was on the <b>9 am</b> 'Ocean Magic 2' and we encountered the tall boys, J 27 'Blackberry' and ?

We sailed our boat S/V Windswept off <b>Salmon Bank</b> and witnessed a special event. There was a small pod of 2 maybe three adult <b>orcas </b>escorting what seemed like 4 younger orcas. One was very young and much smaller then the others that were playing with him. It appeared that they were trying to teach the youngest how to do jumps and rolls. We watched as two would get on each side of the youngest and lift him out of the water on their backs and roll him.

Reports of all 3 pods heading in from the west; <b>J's &amp; K's</b> headed northwest up <b>Haro Strait</b>, while we found <b>L's</b> between<b> False bay and Eagle Point</b>, some near shore, others spread 1/8 mile off of San Juan Island at <b>2:12pm</b>. L-41 Mega was actively foraging with the first part of the flooding tide. A number of females and juveniles fished closer to shore, all making directional changes yet working their way east toward Cattle Point, so we enjoyed watching them until <b>3:45pm</b>. They were actively vocalizing as well, a treat since conditions allowed us to drop our hydrophone and drift for awhile. We don't often see the blows of killer whales, today they showed against the backdrop of the shore cliffs.

We had reports of a potential Super Pod coming in from the West! By the time our trip departed in the afternoon, we heard that <b>L's</b> were down around <b>Middle Bank</b> heading for shoreline, and that <b>Js &amp; K's</b> were at <b>Kelp Reef</b> aiming for Kellett Bluff. We were just north of Kellett Bluff at <b>1510 </b>when we spotted two orcas slowly moving north, and it was none other than J1 Ruffles having quality time with his mom J2 Granny. Ruffles was doing the usual very slow rise to the surface, where his dorsal fin would slowly rise out of the water like a periscope. As this pair lazily passed the boat, our passengers were amazed at the size of his dorsal fin. The echoes of their blows rang off the bluff. Granny was about 400 yards or so past us and suddenly she showed that 98 year-olds can still breach with the best of them. It wasn't long after that J34 Doublestuff, J27 Blackberry, and a majority of J Pod began to catch up to the matriarch and her son. And apparently they were in the mood to play--7 breaches in a row, tail slaps, cartwheels, chin ups, pushing each other from below, and lots and lots of, well, "sea snakes". It seemed like every male that passed the boat was in a randy mood and happily showed it.

Ron Bates, MMRG, received reports early this morning that a large number of <b>Orcas </b>had been sighted near <b>Constance Bank</b>. Our vessel departed Victoria Harbour this morning around <b>9am </b>and within less than 10 minutes of leaving the Harbour we made contact with the Orcas a couple of miles west of Clover Point! Not long after we had arrived on scene we soon realized that we had a <b>Superpod </b>as our Naturalist Kyla Graham and Ron, soon identified several members of all three southern resident pods. As we sat with our engines off we could see a large group of over 60 Orcas moving East towards Clover Point and another large group a few hundred yards ahead also moving East. The Orcas were in resting formation and tightly bunched. The Orcas continued East towards Trial Island and eventually the Orcas did travel through Enterprise Channel and then L-pod split and traveled south whilst J &amp; K-pod traveled towards 10 mile point. Not all of L-pod was present as Mega and part of the L-12's were reported to be heading West past Sooke.

I observed two <b>gray whales</b> transiting southbound past our house on <b>Saratoga Passage</b>. They were about two or three hundred yards offshore, progressing slowly and surfacing about every four and a half minutes. I watched as they loitered in <b>Cama Bay</b>, just north of the new State Park, for about one hour. Perhaps they were feeding as it is rather shallow there. They surfaced in about one minute cycles during that time. They then slowly began to progress back northbound, but much closer to shore. The pair passed the house with one swimming inside the mooring buoy line and one just outside of the mooring buoy line.

At iceberg point on the southern tip of <b>lopez island</b> at about <b>6.30</b> looking south towards port townsend, and saw a whale that was not an orca. it was bigger, had a smaller fin. it was by itself, meandering around, and gradually working its way east. My guess is that it was a humpback whale. just curious if anyone else has mentioned a sighting in that area? thanks, 
<br/>babette saltzman 
<i>We sent photos of minke &amp; humpback fins &amp; asked a few questions to clarify the species on this sighting, &amp; received further information: "the flukes didn't ever come out of the water, but i was able to see them once close to the surface (but still under the water). also, as we were watching the whale, we were remarking about the fact that we never saw a spout. i would say that the shape of the fin was more like the minke, but smaller than the one pictured." 
We are pretty sure this sighting was of a Minke, given the observations &amp; location of the whale - sb</i>

Quite a show (<b>orcas</b>) from about 8am to <b>8:30 am</b> in front of <b>Hannah Heights</b> (west <b>San Juan Island</b>)! Heading north. 
And at 8:48 am an update: Just kidding. They're heading south back in front of Hannah Heights!great front porch action!

<b>8:14 - 9:18 am</b>: There are [<b>orcas</b>] everywhere - resting family lines, tail slaps, spyhops, and a lazy fog rolling in to the shoreline - beautiful. It certainly looked like there could have been members from all three pods. I am sure I saw J's and Mega- Mega was in a beautiful resting line of approx 12-14 whales.

At around <b>7:00am</b> I heard <b>Orcas </b>in <b>Boundary Pass</b> off Saturna Island, near Monarch Head. There was dense fog, mist and light rain, so it was not so easy to make them out. I counted something like 15 - 20, heading west. It was slack tide turning to ebb, with them, but I'd say they were taking their time, very subdued - only two breaches in the half an hour I watched, which is unusual for this passage. The last group was a mature female accompanied by four younger whales, and they went in very close to shore at Monarch Head and swam pretty much in a circle for a couple of minutes, then just floated in the water at the surface for close to a minute, more or less just drifting with their dorsals visible the whole time. Overall I'd say they were not in a hurry, and very much conserving their energy.

We went sailing with friends out of the Port of <b>Everett</b>, and didn't go far, when looking south my wife at <b>3:30 pm</b> saw the blow of a whale just off shore of the Naval Base. The whales where heading south less than a mile from the shore, with us about 2 miles farther out, so we turned south to get a better view. At the naval base they turned west, then north in a large slow arc and came straight at us, we cut sail and let them pass, one came about 60 feet from our starboard side and we got some good pictures. There were 2 <b>grays</b>, feeding slowly on bottom, and coming up every few minutes. They never breached but were rolling slowing on the surface and we saw plenty of fins and tails, with a nose poking out everyone once in a while. I estimate one at about 45 feet long and the others slightly smaller at 39-40 feet. They rotated north, around Everett and headed toward Gedney Island fairly slowly. The last we saw them there were heading north in <b>Possession Sound</b> past Gedney Island.

Off of <b>False Bay, San Juan Island</b>, from <b>2:32pm to 3:37pm</b>, we watched the <b>L-5's</b> and <b>L-54's</b> forage toward the east with the strong flood tide. The mom's near shore, the males further offshore demonstrating their power and grace with rapid twists and turns. L-74 Saanich was lunging, turning sideways, still showing a little wobble in his dorsal fin, about 1000 feet away when he dove. Since he was making many directional changes, I told our passengers to look out into the water, sometimes you can see the white patches on the orca before the whale surfaces. L-74 surprised us all by slowly appearing about 10? feet underwater right next to the port side of the boat! The unusual thing was he stayed there for about 2 minutes, seem to go under the boat and came right below the surface on the starboard side, where he stayed for another minute or so before sinking down. He finally surfaced well past 2 other whale watch boats to our starboard side. The initial dive through encounter to finally surfacing lasted several minutes. I wonder that a salmon was under our boat (I hope he got it!), as he seemed to be on his side, utilizing his monocular vision? We could only see the white glow of an eye patch and part of his chin when he was on our port side, and passengers on the starboard side they exchanged eye contact with him!! If that was not magical enough (L-74 made the unpredictable approach- the safest thing for us to do was to shut down), L-73 Flash (whose dorsal fin sure is wavy like J-1 Ruffles swam with little L-108 Coho keeping up 50 feet behind him, zigzagging rapidly as they fished, 500 feet away. As they turned east, L-108 breached!

Around <b>12:15</b> while sitting on the computer I heard the <b>blows </b>on the beach just as my husband called out "Whales!" I made the 4 minute mad dash through the neighborhood and down the bluff trail to the beach and they were <b>two humpbacks</b> (<b>more likely grays</b>, but not confirmed - sb) - I think - heading north northeast in Saratoga Passage just South of Sandy Point heading towards Camano Head. They did some deep dives and hung about in the middle of the passage feeding for a bit. I am 90% sure they were humpbacks by their flukes and swim pattern, but did not have binoculars to confirm this. 
<br/>Liz Heinrich, Whidbey Island 
<br/><i>From further info. from Liz, &amp; the report above, we think these were likely grays. She observed a "heart- shaped" spout, which is indicative of grays, &amp; we've had reports of 2 grays feeding between this area &amp; Everett as recently as July 27th - very late for feeding grays to remain in this area! sb </i>
<br/>More on humpback whale sighting off Everett:  Thanks for getting back to me. There was definitely a caudal dorsal fin not knuckles. I have spent my whole life on the water and as a naturalist on land and sea, rely heavily on my observation skills. You only get a second to see the details and so have to record them quickly and recheck when you can. I have seen alot of grays also and know the knuckles you speak of, this was a small fin. In regards to the blow, I looked it up in some of our whale books (husband taught marine science at the Ocean Institute in Dana Pt Ca and we are both book hounds) and the books describe the Humpback spout as "bushy and wide" which is what I saw, it wasn't a straight up spout, sort of heartshaped, the height was hard to say as but it seemed like they were around 10' tall, there was not alot to compare it to as they were heading at a diagonal away from the beach and toward open water. Another big clue for me was the tail, the flukes were more upright when they were diving and not the classic gray tail shape. They didn't show flukes until they were out too far to determine if there were knobbies on them w/o binos. Anyway, hope that helps - keeping ears and eyes peeled. Thanks for all you do!

This afternoon around <b>1:30</b> we met up with <b>all three pods</b> about two miles east of <b>Active Pass</b>. They absolutely booked it north this morning, having been just north of San Juan Island around 9:30 AM. All whales were reportedly there except the L5s and L54s (who were picked up off of Hein Bank around that time), but they were spread over 5+ miles and heading northeast. J27, J31, and J39 were traveling with L2, L78, and L88. K- Pod seemed to be the last group to exit the Pass and the last group we looked at was K21, K40, K16, and K35 traveling tight together. <br/>Monika Wieland, Western Prince Naturalist, San Juan Island

Orca Network received a call today from Erica Crust at WA Dept. of Fish &amp; Wildlife - reporting a pod of ~ <b>30 orcas</b> 2.5 miles off Carrol Island near <b>La Push</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Today's journey to Sooke Basin was nothing short of SPECTACULAR. A mother and calf <b>humpback </b>pair were lazily swimming by when all of a sudden they both started to fly out of the water at full speed breaching. At times they breached together, or tagging one another! It was by far the most incredible thing i have seen on the water and i have seen many incredible things over the years. I have waited my whole life for this. I want to thank our captain Anna Hall who made the intuitive navigational choices today, and because of that, we had witnessed nonstop breaches for about 10+ mins window (see photo of the day above). After witnessing the <b>humpbacks</b>, we stopped by Race Rocks to see the harbour seals and sea lions hauled out. Finally, southern resident killer whales <b>Lpod </b>were making their way past Victoria towards the east and were beautifully sighted heading into the distance towards Haro Strait.

<b>11:50am</b> - <b>Orcas </b>observed from beach off <b>Westside Road, San Juan Island</b>. Orcas traveled Northbound on the full moon spring tide, with tall male dorsal fins leading the set. The array of fins indicated J-Pod. At 12:41pm an orca changed direction, and soon after there was some arched diving and rostrums out of the water near shore, possibly during predation. One orca's calls could be heard in air when it's rostrum broke the surface. J1 then made his appearance; there was no mistaking him. Two females with two juveniles then appeared from the South, staying in the area for some time. The sound of an orca exiting the water drew my attention to witness a full breech visible just off-shore. The vanguard of the pod then turned and came back past, and all continued to criss-cross and mill in the area until around 2pm, when they then traveled South out of sight.
<b>8:00pm</b> - Orcas observed from inside tent at <b>County Park, San Juan Island</b>. About 4-5 animals were traveling Southbound at a rapid pace, though surfacing normally. There were no boats present as the mixed-gender group blazed past along the Westside.

The <b>Orcas </b>returned and were within reach today! The killer whales from <b>J &amp; K pods</b>, along with a <b>few L pod</b> members had made their way south from the Fraser River down <b>Rosario Strait</b> to the southwest end of San Juan Island. They were very spread out, milling, feeding from inshore near False Bay out several miles from the shore. This <b>afternoon </b> they had been going north with members of J pod around the Lime Kiln lighthouse off the west side of San Juan Island, when they all turned around heading south. We also heard a report of some L pod members coming in from their day in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Maybe they'll all meet up tonight for a little social hour?! We had an amazing encounter and were caught off guard with a group of 5 Orcas coming our way. We were shutdown and had to remain that way till they were at least 100 yards away. They surfaced and dived playing with each other, changing from moving offshore to then parallel the shore. Our guests were dazzled when they heard some vocalizations even above the surface of the water! I love when it is calm enough to hear this occur! We moved further offshore to see L78 Gaia, a 20-year-old male along with his 16-year-old brother L88 Wavewalker. L88 is a "sprouter male", which means his dorsal fin is still growing and could reach a height of 5-6 feet tall like other male Orcas. As I was looking through my binoculars at L78, I saw a scar/gash/unusual mark on his right side where his dorsal meets the body, before the saddle patch. A little later he had turned, and on the left side there was another scratch/scar starting just at the front of the dorsal.

We watched many members of <b>J, K and L pods</b> heading in from the west. I don't believe all members of the pods were together in the large group of Orca we saw just off the <b>Victoria</b> waterfront as I would say only 45 whales were present. I was able to ID L78 whose scars appear to be healing nicely, J1 and J2, J30, J8, J 41, J19 and J42, J27, and one of the very small babies. K21 and K40 were there along with many others that were hard to determine on brief visits for air at the surface. It was fascinating to see the little ones briefly spyhopping and tail slapping as if to say, "Well I am awake now." It was a lovely evening with the setting sun turning dorsal fins bronze, while the orca continued past in a slow resting formation.

At <b>4pm </b>or shortly after driving north on Hwy 1 not far north from Goat Rock State Park (between Jenna &amp; <b>Mendocino, CA</b>) I saw a few blows and some people standing along the fence line back off of shore. I pulled over and sure enough, I counted 11 different spouts. Very large, tall spouts with a couple of smaller spouts. Definitely <b>Blue Whales with one Humpback</b>. They were feeding in the area and not traveling in any particular direction. We watched them for over an hour. Two Blues were close to shore several times. I was surprised to see Blue Whales so close to shore. Beautiful sight indeed. Regards,

Today we had early morning reports of <b>L Pod</b> south of <b>Lopez Island</b>, but the thick fog prevented anyone from actually finding them. In the meantime, <b>Js, Ks, and some Ls</b> that had been up north yesterday came down <b>Rosario Channel</b>. We caught up with the whales near the Burrows Lighthouse, and even from 1 mile away, it was evident that the whales were excited about something. You could see the huge splashes of breaches against the shoreline, and then you'd spot a bright white chin during a spyhop. We paralleled whales about 250 yards away, and began counting the breaches - we stopped counting at 32, even though there were more. The highlight of all these acrobatics was a rare (for me anyway) double breach. The whales were working against a flood tide, but managed to find every back eddy they could to move southward. We saw J30 Riptide, and J26 Mike (both easy to spot from long distance), and we saw one of the two new J calves.

We were sailing south from the south tip of <b>Camano Island</b> towards Everett, along the "ledge" (dropoff) that runs from the mouth of the Snohomish along Jetty Island. We saw whales blowing to the south. (I am <b>guessing they were grey whales</b>). From what we could see, they were near the entrance to the harbor, right off from the green buoy. As we continued to sail south, they headed north. We eventually realized that there were two whales, both of them located inland from us, feeding in the shallows alongside Jetty Island. They appeared to be slowly swimming sideways, with one side fin up in the air, and with a portion of the tail visible. We guessed they were feeding on the bottom. We got a good look at their fins and tails, which were heavily mottled. My husband checked the depth and it showed at about 10 feet, so the whales were feeding in something shallower than that, which is hard to believe given their size. After passing by the first whale, suddenly the second one turned and started towards us. (Could have been spooked by power boat in vicinity?) Although we attempted to turn out of its way, it kept on towards us with its fin up in the air. Suddenly there was a huge cloud of sand in the water, and the whale went directly underneath our boat! Although we were too busy trying to get out of the way to check the depth sounder, nevertheless we are fairly certain we were in less than 20 feet of water when it went underneath. As our sailboat draws about 4 feet, that means it was a close one, as this 35-40 ft (est) animal only had 15 ft of depth (at most) to squeeze by. It didn't surface again until it was quite a long way off. This is as close an encounter as I care to have, thank you.

All three pods headed north together last night (7/31), but were found taking two different routes south again today. <b>J-Pod, K-Pod, and at least the the L2s and L7s from L- Pod</b> took a "normal" route down <b>Boundary Pass</b>, past Turn Point, and down to the west side of San Juan Island, but the rest of L-Pod came down <b>Presidents Channel and San Juan Channel</b> before heading up to reunite with the other pods. On the Western Explorer this afternoon we met up with the Ls in San Juan Channel. The L12s were in the lead, with another large group of L-Pod whales a little ways behind them. In this larger group I was able to get positive IDs of L5, L73, L84, L74, L100, L26, L90, L92, L82, and L105, so it looks like most of the family groups were probably there. After getting back to port I headed out to <b>Land Bank</b> on the westside of San Juan Island, where at about 5 PM I saw the last groups of Js and Ks heading south. J1 was close to shore with L53, but other than that the whales were spread out across Haro Strait.

While crossing down <b>Boundary Pass</b>, [<b>orcas</b>] began passing the boat heading for the Turn Point Lighthouse (<b>1115</b>). As a few whales got close enough to ID, we were happy to find we were viewing <b>J Pod &amp; K Pod</b>. The whales seemed to be very active, with lots of surface percussives - spyhops, tail lobs, headstands, and a few breaches by the calves. But the fireworks really got going when the whales hit the tide rips near Turn Point. They were actively working the line between the strong floodtide and the upwellings, and soon a group consisting of L2 Grace, L78 Gaia (his rakes are healing nicely), L90 Ballena began to breach one after the other. Five breaches in a row, where one whale would breach and before that one was finished, the next whale would breach.  We left the whales and began to head home and discovered L Pod traveling down San Juan Channel! They were spread in groups of 7-8, with whales from mid channel all the way to shoreline. For our second trip, we joined up with the <b>L's</b> still moving down <b>San Juan Channel</b> (<b>1530</b>). By this time, there were only 2-3 boats on scene, all giving the whales 200 yards or more. It was amazing to see these whales working the tide - they would find the back eddies and use them to power against the current. These L's were probably the most active I've seen in quite some time with over 15 breaches, tons of tail lobs, porpoising, and other surface percussives. And for only the 3rd or 4th time in the last few years, I watched residents work the shore along Cape San Juan and Goose Island. Then the whales headed right for the Cattle Point lighthouse, giving the shore watchers a nice viewing as well. We left the whales at <b>1630</b>, and they were porpoising towards Eagle Point (J's &amp; K's by this time were at Lime Kiln, so I imagine they were hearing each other).

We were out on a morning tour in Canadian Waters viewing Orcas from <b>J &amp; K pods</b> heading south from the <b>Gulf Islands</b> on their routine swim following salmon through these waters. We could hear the blows (hot moist air) being expelled through the blowhole! A few breaches, tail slaps! We were heading home when to our disbelief L pod was in <b>San Juan Channel</b>!! More Orcas!! Right outside our home port of Friday Harbor. This happens on occasion (once a year?), but it is really unusual and such a treat!! Despite the boats, they sure seemed to be enjoying themselves - breach after breach and tail slaps as they continued south through the channel.

<b>4 transient killer whales</b>, 1 large male, 1 smaller orca with perhaps two females. at <b>8:15 pm</b> passing about 400 meters from Pipers lagoon in the <b>Georgia Strait</b>. There were various kayaks and small pleasure craft vessels following closely behind them all the while - frustrating to watch from shore. The orcas seemed to be checking out the rocks abeam of us where seals haul out, we had 1 seal close to us off the beach. They then passed in front of snake island, passing New Castle Island and then were passing Gabriola Island (Nanaimo side).

Candi Emmons reported <b>L pod</b> coming down <b>San Juan Channel</b> this afternoon, then heading through Cattle Pass. 
<br/>*<br/>
Fairly large pod of <b>Orcas </b>just passed <b>Saturna Island</b> heading west. Guessing about 35-45, but water was too choppy and they were too spread out to get a good count. Numerous mature males -- no positive ID's. Last of them made Monarch Head and Java Its about 10:30 am. Mainly travelling, but some foraging possible around Java as a good number were doubling back and moving across the main flow -- lingering for 10-15 minutes. Average amount of breaching, fluking etc.

Orca Network received a call from Jessie Glenden of WDFW, saying he'd talked to several Tuna fishermen at <b>Westport WA</b>, &amp; around <b>noon</b> they saw 2 adult <b>orcas </b>&amp; 1 calf at 46 51N, 124 38W.
