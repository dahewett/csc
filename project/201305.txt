Gang o' T's. These pics are from our encounter with <b>a large gang of Southbound Transients</b>. We first came on scene 0.5 miles off the Van Isl shoreline just south of <b>Campbell River </b>(northwest Georgia Strait). Witnessed what I thought was a seal being tossed around when we first came on scene. Some hunting behaviour occurred during our time with them, but nothing to exciting. Not like the breaches from the other day! Id's that I could get include <b>T018-019-019B-019C/ 023-023C-023D-023C3-023D3/ 075B-075B1-075C/ and lone female 121A</b> whom I am sure I have not seen very often!

So lucky to have <b>J-Pod</b> hanging around on the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b> all day today. The J-16s were very playful and it seemed that one little guy just couldn't stay in the water.

Here are some images from our AMAZING encounter with the<b> 002C's and 123's</b>. We had a report of 5 KW's off of <b>Marina Island</b> (near Campbell River, north end of Georgia Strait) from a watertaxi. So all the vessels converged on the area. 2 had gone through, no luck, so we slowed down and had a good look. When my guest who was facing backwards spotted them she practically jumped out of her seat! They were being very social, some tail lobs, small spy hops etc. the Juveniles were doing small breaches. Then all of a sudden T002C came flying out of the water so high I couldn't believe it!! Still amazed I was able to capture it! She then jumped 4 more x back to back! 123A got in on the action and breached a few times as well! Every time we went to leave it started again!

On the way back to our dock at Snug Harbor we heard a report of inbound whales. To old salty sea captains, like me, that means whales coming in from the ocean west of Victoria, but probably more Ts. Then the sweet words came over our radio!<b> Js!</b> We've seen them only four times since March so the news was especially sweet. The <b>Js were happy and all accounted for</b>, including Granny, their 100ish year old matriarch. 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/> 
Yay for <b>J Pod</b>! I love the sight of whales in the <b>evening</b>! They were bombing north with the flood tide.

At<b> 12:50PM</b> I was looking out from Beechyhead in <b>East Sooke park </b>today and saw <b>10-20 orcas about 500m off shore</b> . At <b>2:13PM</b> they had all gone through <b>Race passage. 3:30PM </b>they were off <b>Albert head</b>. At the times that I was observing them, the whales were always with-in a 100m of each other.

I saw<b> 3 orcas in Sechelt Inlet</b> heading towards Porpoise Bay Marina in Sechelt (about 25 miles NW of Vancouver BC). They were chasing a pod of <b>Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b>. There seemed to be one huge male orca and 2 smaller ones. It was about <b>10:30am </b>they chased them into the bay and then left and headed out of the inlet. There were lots of boats around so probably they got scared off? The dolphins hung around though in the marina probably scared of the orcas.  Anyway..it was really cool because the orcas came really close to the marina and you could see them easily without binoculars even.

We encountered a breaching <b>Minke Whale</b> a few miles west of <b>Hein Bank</b> (south of San Juan island). This Minke actually breached 5 times in a row, something most of us had never seen before, it was an incredible sight:)

We saw a <b>humpback </b>do several full breaches near the <b>southern end of Lopez Island</b>! It was absolutely breathtaking to see a creature of that size lunge out of the water, over and over! And the noises he was making were so loud - it was almost like he was grunting or growling at the same time as he would come up and do his blows on the surface.
<br/>Naturalist Leizel Grant
<br/>*<br/>
The amazing, incredible, breaching <b>Humpback in San Juan Channel</b>!!! Roughly 33 breaches in about 3 miles! Multiple ferries even got to see it too! The Western Explorer is in the image, and the UW Friday Harbor Labs is in the background.

Very rare to see the<b> T77s</b>. We got there in time to see them taking a seal, out near <b>Albert Head, BC</b>, south of Victoria. We left them after the kill headed toward Race Rocks, at<b> 3:00 in the afternoon</b>.

At <b>4:06pm </b>a very large mature<b> Humpback Whale</b> surfaced directly in front of our place in <b>Davis Bay (Sechelt), BC</b>. It was a single animal and was traveling south along the shoreline in shallower water. It surfaced approximately 10 times in the time I observed it, making dives and showing it's tail. It is not common to see whales on this area of the coast so it is considered a significant sighting locally. The first time I saw it, it surfaced about 100 feet from shore and I was looking directly down on top of it from my vantage point then chased it along the beach trying to get photos. Was a thrilling thing to see!
<br/>Ian Bolden

Saw what I take to be <b>a minke whale about 11 a.m. on Partridge Bank</b>. It was cruising NNE.

Our new favourite <b>Georgia Strait humpback</b> was the star of the show again today. It was found just northwest of the Sandheads light station, lunge feeding, at times in only 20 feet of water! Not much fluking today, but we observed many lunges at the surface, with the whale sometimes surfacing upside down. As we departed, the Hb was headed southwest into the deeper waters of<b> Georgia Strait</b>.

Some of the <b>20-25 offshore killer whales in Kachemak Bay, Alaska</b>. They killed a few sharks; floating liver samples were collected for species ID. They rested after foraging for two hours. Can you spot the baby?

Large <b>gray whale surfacing in Plumper Sound</b>, north shore of South Pender heading east about 25 minutes ago. <b>Our neighbor thinks it's a Humpback</b>. They spotted one earlier this morning heading into Plumper Sound. HUGE event for us!

<br/>*<br/>
Had the <b>T123's and 002C's this afternoon</b>. They appeared northbound up the <b>East shore of Texada Island</b>. We picked them up just after a kill of some kind had occurred. There were multiple breaches and other activity shortly before us arriving on scene. We arrived on scene @<b>1445 </b>and left @<b>1630</b>. When we left they were traveling north @ 4-5 knots, aiming for Grants Reef just south of Savary island. <b>123A </b>was travelling with <b>002C2</b>, bringing up the rear. Does anyone else notice that 002C2 is always behind a little when the gang is swimming? It's something I always wonder. Seems to be happening more lately when I have seen them. The order switched, and when I left 2C was with her calf, 2C1 was speed swimming with 123A, and 123 and C2 were bringing up the rear!

This afternoon around <b>12pm </b>Jon Scordino received a call from the fish dock reporting <b>killer whales inside the Neah Bay harbor</b>. Unfortunately our boat was not available, but I went and sighted them from land. When I first caught up to them (<b>12:15</b>) they were way inside the harbor, closer to the jetty side, straight out from the fuel dock. I watched them until about <b>12:45</b> when they were passing the coast guard dock on the way out of the harbor. They were probably inside the harbor for over an hour based on when and where they were first reported. My best guess was <b>4-5 whales</b>. I think at least 3 adult sized and one smaller one. There was one large male with a somewhat wavy looking dorsal fin. They were just traveling very slow and occasionally milling around.

<i><br/>The Center for Whale Research responds to the photos: The photos are tentatively identified by Dave Ellifrit as T73B, T73C, and T73C1, with the highest confidence being T73B. They are on the DFO Transient guide page 72/73. They are not common in this area. They are in the report of 6 May 2013 off Trinidad, CA. T73B was a juvenile in our first Hood Canal encounter years ago (2003).

We decided to go for the more northerly orcas at <b>Crofton </b>- turns out it was the always-exciting <b>T49B's and T65A's</b>. By the time we got there, they had already caught something - still not entirely certain what, but the prey was divided up early and it seems everyone had a piece to swim around with or toss around. T65A2 swam past us underwater with a piece of the leftovers gripped in its mouth. They were batting pieces of hide and blubber around with their tails quite a lot. In one shot, an orca has this piece wrapped around her peduncle, and the colouring of it matches quite closely - perhaps it was a Dall's porpoise. The whales were spread out in a couple little subgroups that kept diverging and regrouping. Lots of action, lots of gulls picking up scraps.

I live on Hammerslet Inlet in <b>Shelton, Wa</b>. I spotted <b>2 small Orca this morning at 6:45am</b>. They were headed out toward main channel and away from Shelton. I hope I can hear back from someone when they're spotted headed my way as I always get great pictures.

On our last day of Marine Naturalist Training we were treated to a field trip aboard the Odyssey. On our return, Capt. Pete spotted <b>a minke at 10:00</b> am traveling northbound in <b>San Juan Channel</b>. Calm waters made this minke easy to see as it continued surfacing every 4-5 minutes in a zig-zag pattern, two times very near our boat much to the thrill of us all. We left the minke about 10:40 am still making it's way northbound.

<br/>*<br/>
There were <b>three orcas</b>, one male for sure. This was the first time that I have been able to spot them all the way down here in the <b>deep south of Puget Sound</b>! There are too many long inlets and so few public places to get a good open view from shore when they finally do make it down this far. It must have been my lucky day today, though!..further south in <b>Totten Inlet (12:20 pm</b>). This one breached about 10 times in a row!
<br/>Gayle Swigart
<br/>*<br/>
Julie from Olympia called to report seeing <b>3 orcas in Totten Inlet </b>this afternoon, Sunday, at<b> 3 pm</b>. She was in a canoe traveling from Mud Bay to Totten Inlet, up around the Steamboat Island area. The orcas were first heading SW, then turned and headed back toward the NE. One of the orcas was displaying what is often referred to as a "sea snake" or "pink floyd" - possibly a little mating or playing around going on?!
<br/>*<br/>
We saw them too! They were down in <b>Totten near Gallagher Cove</b>, then they headed north out of the inlet and around the top of Hope Island. Appeared to be one adult and two smaller ones.

Magic moments for boat and land-based whale watchers as members of <b>J pod</b> foraged along the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>. Although the whales were well spread out, two spending time happily together and sharing a freshly caught salmon were <b>Hy'Shqa (J37) and her son, J49</b> - such a delight to see this little one has made it safely through the winter.
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Naturalist on Mystic Sea
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:30 PM -</b> As I was sitting on a rock, a pair came by first, one a large male and this one; I've identified the large male as Blackberry, but need help with this one. This one tail lobbed RIGHT in front of me and it's an experience I'll never forget. Sorry if this is not the best ID photo... Later, a group of 8+ orcas came by. The whole experience was great! Taken at <b>Lime Kiln</b>.
<br/>Rachel Haight
<br/>*<br/>
We had just begun our goodbyes at our graduation ceremony for the Spring 2013 Marine Naturalists Training at the Whale Museum when I received texts from both Pam and Ed that <b>J pod was on the hydrophones</b>. We cleared the museum pretty fast, making our way to the west side of the island where we spent the next four hours with J pod &amp; L87 as they partook in the west side shuffle. First planted ourselves at <b>Land Bank</b> watching them spread out in small groups a couple of miles apart heading southbound. They stalled at Hannah Heights and a bit south for over an hour when a breach seemed to signal the move northward. Orca and humans alike made their way back to Land Bank where youngsters J38 Cookie, J44 Moby and J47 Notch engaged in much tactile behavior very close to shore where we could see them quite beautifully underwater. They continued their engagements &amp; rituals further up at Lime Kiln as did we. I heard above water vocals for the first time and was privileged to see "sea snakes" on a couple of occasions. The pod engaged in just about every tactile and active behavior imaginable. I feel completely blessed to have witnessed their bonds and culture in such an intimate and beautiful place. A dream encounter come true.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:19 -</b> Boy, <b>J pod</b> is really working the west side today! Back on<b> Lime Kiln hydrophones</b> once again....Sounds like a party to me!
<br/>Pam Ren
<br/>*<br/>
AMAZING DAY WITH <b>J-POD MOTHER, Hy'Shqa J37, AND HER BABY, J49</b>! At first they were all spread out; some were milling near shore and some were further offshore, traveling south in small groups. But J37 and J49 were the stars of the show, as they were really active -- splashing around and swimming in tight circles, and within a couple of minutes we saw them flip a big Salmon up in the air that they had been chasing! We also saw J2, J16, and J26, all off the west side of San Juan Island, just south of Pile Point, and even caught 2 full breaches. We had fantastic, warm weather and flat calm seas today!

Stephanie Raymond on the Victoria Clipper reported a pod of <b>4 - 5 Transients</b>, with a small calf, traveling north in <b>Possession Sound </b>this morning at<b> 9:24 am</b>. They stopped and mingled around the Clinton Ferry dock, it appeared they may have made a kill there; then they continued north bound.

While moving my "new" boat from Olympia north to Bellingham, I was fortunate to see at least <b>3 Orca in southern Puget Sound</b> between Boston Harbor and Hunter's Point. That was on Saturday about<b> 1 PM</b>. They were traveling North toward Hunter's Point. The only identification I can provide is that one appeared to have a larger dorsal, seemed narrow and very straight.  The other two appeared to be smaller. My sightings of Orca in that area are very rare over the the last 50 years or so. 
<br/>Jim Opsata
<br/>*<br/>
No idea what <b>J pod</b> had been up to before they made it back to the islands, but we have watched them <b>resting literally hours - 4 and counting</b> if not more...And they are doing the west side shuffle while they rest....they have not been out of sight since early this afternoon. Super tight group or two, up down, up down. Some of these fisherman out here have had the experience of a lifetime. Sigh.

Today the Mystic Sea did a complete circumnavigation of the San Juan Islands, covering about 100 miles! We finally found the whales at <b>Hannah Heights</b>, heading north very slowly. It was a great show with <b>20+ Orcas from J pod</b> - we saw several fluke shots and tail slaps and even a couple breaches! We also saw several Bald Eagles, some Harbor Seals, lots of Harbor Porpoise, and even had a quick visit with a California Sea Lion.

We noticed <b>three orcas at 5:00 p.m.</b> heading north out of <b>Eld Inlet</b>. Then they dove.

<b>2:45 - Humpback whale. Salsbury park</b>. - north of <b>Hood canal bridge</b>. Saw it three times, then it fluked in what appeared to be a deep dive. Last seen headed towards Port Gamble. The whale was heading north out of Hood Canal and surfaced maybe 30 feet off shore. I of course was looking at my phone. I heard it, and the kid yelling so grabbed my camera and headed around the point. The whale continued around the point still 30-40 ft off the shore, past the dock and the three boat launches. The boat launches were stacked up with shrimpers waiting to pull their boats in. The whale surfaced again, 10 ft off one of the waiting boats. It surfaced one last time, and this time did a deep dive, and by the time I got my camera organized, I barely captured it's flukes disappearing. I saw it surface two more times as it headed out of the bay, and then three times from Point No Point before it disappeared headed north.

I saw <b>one whale</b> today at <b>2:18pm</b> as I headed west on the <b>Hood Canal Bridge</b>! I was approximately 1/4th the way across the bridge heading west &amp; I saw the whale to my right, on the north side of the bridge, heading south, on its way under the bridge. It's huge body rolled &amp; then its huge tail fluke came out of the water. The bridge obstructed any view of head. I'm not familiar enough with types of whales to determine what type of whale this was, but the tail was a grey color &amp; classic shape. <b>Humpback</b>? Unfortunately, I was unable to pull my car to the side of the rode to continue to watch him to see if there were any markings, what he was doing, get photos, etc. I have lived in Port Ludlow for 15 years &amp; cross the bridge on practically a daily basis &amp; have never seen whales there before (at the Hood Canal Bridge), so I thought this might be of interest to you. Also, I am concerned that he was going in the wrong direction &amp; may be lost?

Spent much of the day on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> watching J pod make their way from the south end near <b>Salmon Bank</b>.

I had a very interesting encounter with the <b>T49Bs and T65As</b> in the morning. Pelagic from Deer Harbor Charters found the whales near 
<b>Crane Island</b> at about <b>8:30 AM</b>. I headed out on the Western Explorer to see them in San Juan Channel, near Yellow Island, then Pelagic left. At one point, as the whales went down for a long dive (about 5 minutes), a 45'-50' power boat came up the channel at speed. The boat passed me at about 100 yards to my offshore side, throwing about a 3' wake. As the boat continued on its way the whales suddenly surfaced in the boat's wake and began surfing it. This continued for about 2-3 minutes until the boat's captain finally seemed to notice and stopped the boat, at which point the whales went back to traveling up the channel. Later that morning, near Speiden Island they attacked a Steller Sea Lion, which managed to make it safely to shore.

It was interesting to watch T65A and T65A4, who were several hundred yards north, come porpoising at high speed to the rest of the group, where they were subduing a harbour seal. T65A and T65A4 then joined in the feast. It was like they were being called for dinner!

<b>9:10am - Humpback whale</b> just off end of<b> Fauntleroy ferry dock</b>, flippering (pectoral slapping) the water. Possibly moving slowly north. I was too far away to get a photo before the whale submerged, but the shape and size of the flipper (12'-16') and the slapping of the water were unmistakable Humpback traits. People on the ferry said that the whale had been very close to the boat (while docked at the pier). I watched the water for an additional 5 minutes until the ferry left, but sadly didn't see the animal again. Absolutely phenomenal experience - I never expected to see a Humpback in Puget Sound.

I'd like to report a sighting of killer whales that my family and I had this <b>morning</b>. We witnessed what seemed to be between <b>2 to 3 orcas off the coast of Fort Bragg, CA</b>. This happened <b>around 11AM</b>. We were taking a walk on the paved coastal trail in MacKerricher State park, and had a very good view over the water. We discovered what seemed to be at first, a greyish -brown big belly floating up and thought it was a grey whale. But suddenly those heads popped up, which were clearly black with the white round marking around the eye and more white marking down the side. We now believe the greyish thing, may have been seals, they were feeding on? We could see the spouts and all. At one point there seemed to be 3, but definitely 2 different heads visible. They were about half a mile north of the area where part of the beach is sectioned off due to the baby seals in the area, and about a quarter of mile away from the beach. They were swimming north. Sorry, we don't have pictures.

Around <b>8am at East Point/Fox Spit</b> there was <b>a gray </b>who hung around for an hour. It was rolling around on its side, moving slowly probably abut 40 yards from shore. My husband watched it from south of the point on our deck then walked down to the beach and saw watched it head north.

<b>8:30PM - Whale breaching in Elliott bay</b> off Seattle tonight.

Not sure if anyone else reported this... The video (I think) speaks for itself. This seemed to be <b>a lone Humpback </b>traveling south along <b>the downtown Seattle waterfront</b> at approximately <b>9:30pm</b>.  I did not see it surface again after sounding just off Pier 66. This is the first Humpback I have seen <b>in Elliott Bay </b>(assuming my ID is correct?).

About<b> 5:30 p.m.</b> several of us saw a whale off <b>Edmonds Marina Beach</b>. Today when talking with a NOAA volunteer at a festival, we are thinking it was<b> a humpback</b>. This whale was black, it blew a large plume of water, and it dove down showing it's V-shaped tail.

We had a wonderful day with <b>a humpback whale </b>today off <b>East Point, Saturna Island</b>. We heard the humpback was near East Point around <b>12:30</b> and when we left the scene at about<b> 3:15 </b>he was still in that general area, pointing North. There was lots of surface activity including lots of pec slaps, a mini cartwheel, and even a breach! We also got some great fluke shots. I'd love to know who it was we saw out there today!

From <b>Bainbridge Island, approx 6pm, about 2 miles south of Agate Pass</b>, I was kayaking with a friend in completely quiet and still water and we heard a big SPLASH... Looked over and there was the top of a whale, about 30 feet long &amp; approx 500 feet away. Didn't get a good look as the sun was setting behind it, but thinking it to be <b>the lone humpback</b> that has been sighted in the area??? Watched for a few minutes but didn't see it surface again. What a privilege.

Awesome day in the southern Strait of Georgia! We encountered a significant group (<b>at least 11, likely more) of Bigg's (transient) orcas</b>, spread out approximately one mile off the eastern shore of <b>Tumbo Island (east side of Saturna Island).</b> There were at least two main groups of animals (1/4 mile apart) heading south east, with what appeared to be the signature ragged edge dorsal of <b>T63 </b>about several hundred yards out from the nearest group (other boats on scene confirmed the presence of T63). Our boat was fortunate enough to spend time with the<b> T2Cs, T123s, and T102</b> who were traveling in a closeknit group, surfacing in unison at a leisurely pace. T102 broke off from the group to travel on his own, while <b>T123A and T2C1 </b>(aka "Rocky") were seen engaged in some "touchy feely" tactile behavior (I saw T2C1 upside-down at one point with T123A rolling on his side in unison). T123A has some discoloration on the right side of his dorsal (like a grey sunburn) ... something to take note of next time he is seen. Very beautiful and so exciting to see multiple Bigg's killer whales in one area! I feel very lucky to have seen them.

Best EVER encounter with <b>Transients</b> tonight 10 minutes from the dock...Unbelievable Transient Orca Show in <b>Samsum Narrows</b>. I have never seen Transients so social and airbourne. At one point there were four orcas completely out of the water at the same time. Lots and lots of surface vocalizations and even vocalizations while they were breaching. The Orcas blows and surface vocalizations were echoing off the rock bluffs at Bold Bluff in Sansum Narrows. They were still going off non-stop when I left at dark. It was the <b>T049B's and the T065A's</b>, totaling seven animals.

We have had some very interesting whale sightings around <b>East Point, Saturna Island </b>this past week. There have been<b> 2 separate confirmed sightings of pilot whales</b>. Those of us that live out this way have never seen them here before, at least in the past 5 years (I don't know of the years before that). The first sighting was two or three - the report was made by John Gahn on your site (I asked him to post with you). John is formerly from Oregon and is familiar with pilot whales in those waters and has spent a lot of time on the water. He was in a kayak and couldn't get an overview. The second report was my neighbours', Rick Graham and Kevin Leslie, who saw 2 very close to our shoreline close to East Point Park. Rick used to work at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was rather funny because the day before I told them about the pilot whale sighting and they didn't believe me :) The next day they saw them and confirmed that they truly are pilot whales.
Then a rare occurrence of <b>a humpback whale in Boundary Pass on Friday, May 2</b>, breaching and showing off it's huge pectorals. And, <b>a grey whale close to Tumbo Island </b>- not very common here either. The <b>transient orcas have been seen almost everyday</b>. It's been a great week of fantastic sightings!
<br/>Maureen Welton
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>7 pm</b>, Bonnie Gretz of Coupeville called to relay a report from Dan Miranda, of <b>a Gray whale splashing around in Penn Cove</b>, Coupeville, near the boat launch. 
<br/>*<br/>
Clarence Hein called to relay a report he'd received from a friend who was at the Front Street Grille <b>in Coupeville, watching a Gray whale spy-hopping</b> in front of the restaurant - wow - Coupeville is getting a show tonight!!

I'd like to report the sighting of <b>2 Orcas, one male and one female</b>, traveling north from <b>Narvaez Bay, Saturna Island</b> around East Pt. and continuing north in the Georgia Straight. Sighting them from kayaks we watched them for about an hour and one half from <b>9:30am until 11:00am</b>.  
<br/>They were traveling at a leisurely pace taking long dives and then a few breaths on the surface. Once they entered the Georgia Str. they both engaged in tail slapping on each surfacing. It was a beautiful day with flat seas and clear conditions. The whale blows could be heard from a considerable distance away. 
<br/>John Gahn, Saturna Island, BC
<br/>*<br/>
We searched the flat calm waters for almost 5 hours before finally seeing <b>T20 and T21</b> break the surface in the <b>Strait of Georgia</b>. The views of the coastal mountains were unbelievable and water conditions couldn't have been better. Another great day out there!

On a truly glorious spring (more like summer) day, one young <b>Minke whale</b> kept passengers on "Mystic Sea" guessing where he (or she) would surface next in the glassy sea off the <b>west side of San Juan Island</b>.

Sighting of what I think were <b>two greys </b>just southwest of Hat Island, around <b>0915</b>. The ferry slowed to keep a distance from them. Was there a baby grey? I saw one spray from a blow hole...the spine/body, then another spay from different whale next to the spine, then fluke from whale of first spray. I did not see the fluke of the second whale. So exciting and we were so close. I have been keeping an eye out all spring and this is the first time to spot a grey. They're so beautiful!

Not sure if its the same one but about <b>8 pm</b> walking down <b>Ruston way (Tacoma)</b>- most positively saw <b>a humpback </b>jump out of the water- completely out of the water- about maybe 200 yards off shore- unfortunately there was no one else around- accept a guy driving by on a motorcycle- that saw it as well and pulled in and stopped to watch- I must say- it was AWESOME-

Not sure if you got any reports but haven't seen any on your site or the West Seattle blog- yesterday we were in the car line on the Ferry dock at <b>3pm</b>, looked up and saw <b>a large whale (think it was a humpback</b> from shape, coloring and small hump) come out of the water then followed with the tail out of the water. Maybe 100' off of shore in Lincoln Park, 100' N of the dock. Just saw it 1x, then drove onto the ferry. Went up onto the deck and several people up there saw it going S on the other side of the ferry dock, again maybe 100' off of the shore (we could see the trail in the water). Disappeared from view after the point. Happened too fast for us to get a pic, but I'd be surprised if some Orca Network or WSB readers didn't have a pic or video. Truly awesome, unexpected, and amazing how close in it was.

<b>A gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale</b> has recently been <b>photographed in Walvis Bay, Namibia</b>.

My wife announced about <b>10:30</b> that she saw a couple big dorsal fins [about <b>a mile south of Little Skookum in Totten Inlet,</b> where the <b>two Risso's dolphins</b> were seen May 6]. Of course I had to look so I grabbed the camera and headed for the lawn to take a few shots.

The Mystic Sea found <b>two Transient Orcas </b>about 3 miles <b>south of Trial Island</b>, south of Victoria. We identified them as brothers; <b>T93, born in 1963, and T97, born in 1980</b>. The two Transients were travelling fairly fast, making about 7 knots. They were veering apart and then coming back together . . . then Captain Monte Hughes shut the engines off for a while and it was such a treat to watch their huge dorsal fins rise up out of the water together, when the only sounds to be heard were of the water lapping up against the hull of the boat, and the mystical sound of the Orcas' blows! When it was time for the Mystic Sea to start heading home the whales were off of Constance Bank heading east towards Whidbey Island. On the way back towards Lopez Island we had a great sighting of a large group of Harbor Porpoise (almost like mini-Orcas!) playing on the surface near the weather buoy.
