We had a fun visit from <b>1-1/2 year-old J50, Scarlet</b>, today. She came over to check out our hydrophone that was dangling by the boat which we were using to listen to her family vocalizing! Eye contact once again. Magic. -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Nothing but whales and water - <b>L47 Marina and her son L115 Mystic off Land Bank </b>this afternoon.nd
<b>4:30 p.m. - Some of L47s and L26s just came back southbound past Land Bank</b>, didn't know they were north of us.
<br/><b>3:34 p.m. - Boats are spread from Hannah to Salmon Bank up to 2 mi offshore</b> trending west.
<br/><b>1:48 p.m. - Whales did flip before Lime Kiln, went west then south presumably to join up with others who look northbound off American Camp</b> now. -Monika Wiela

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:30 p.m. - L Pod is at Salmon Bank (L-92, L-83, L-110)</b> spread out and apparently foraging with some success. All boats doing a great job of observing from a respectful distance, happy to report. -Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J-19 "Shachi" breaching in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. -Carrie Sapp

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

It's been an incredible past couple of weeks on the water. Yesterday, July 31st, we saw <b>members of the L4 and L47 matrilines socializing with J pod</b>. They were engaging in tactile behavior all day with periods of forging in between. In the evening the <b>Ls were heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, seemingly heading for the Pacific. We shall see who's around today! It was definitely nice to see some of L pod again. Now if only K pod would come back ...-Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0902 a.m. - 6-7 orcas (including 1 adult male - 6 foot dorsal) in Rosario Strait</b>, seen west side of Deception Pass, close to Whidbey side. Traveling southbound directionally towards Port Townsend. Some breaching. -Eric Adams

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>0849 - Orcas west of Rosario Beach</b>, Anacortes. While visiting Rosario beach today my family and friends spotted multiple Orcas. One in particular with a baby. They were very active for about 30 minutes before heading towards Oak Harbor. -Shannon Conley

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 p.m. - 6+ orcas (Bigg's killer whales (Transients)) off Pender</b>. Tonight just before sunset we sighted a small group of orcas,maybe approximately 6 individuals (including1-2males) <b>off Theives Bay</b>. They were pretty far offshore traveling but then they backtracked. Then they appeared to stop and go into a resting pattern, with a few forming a resting line at times. That was very cool to see, a behaviour I have not had the privilege to see before! Beautiful orca sunset! -Jana Johnson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The first time I saw it I could've sworn I also saw <b>a bigger orca - like dorsal surfacing with the Fin whale</b>. I only saw it once... (observing from south of Bush Point when whales in Admiralty Inlet prior to Stus's sighting) -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Fin whale</b> - I had / have the exact same experience / reaction to believing there was an Orca too... I've seen enough orcas now to know it had to be one, versus a humpback or the Fin! And the behavior of the sea lion was classic of when a transient is nearby! My little video is posting now.
<br/><b>8:10 p.m. - reason I saw the Fin whale</b>.. Was cause I believed I saw a single huge dorsal of an Orca. I watched the Fin go by, now I see the huge dorsal again seemingly paralleling the Fin whale - both now south of Edmonds ferry terminal and slowly south bound.
<br/><b>7:58 p.m. -</b>  looks to have turned more toward a easterly (towards <b>Edmonds Waterfront</b> dog park)
<br/><b>7:54 p.m. -  the "fin" whale</b> is just north of<b> Edmonds Kingston ferry route</b> -- more on the Edmonds side heading south. Huge rounded arches and dives.. No fluke. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The first time I saw it I could've sworn I also saw <b>a bigger orca - like dorsal surfacing with the Fin whale.</b> I only saw it once, then wondered if it may have been the tip of its fluke, but it had just surfaced so don't see how that could be (unless it has a calf traveling with it which would be way too much to hope for!). But that is what made me look twice, and when I saw the dorsal on the whale again it was larger than a humpback, but not the larger triangular shaped thing I saw the first time. Maybe it was an orca chasing it, and that's why it was moving so fast?!
<br/><b>5:38 p.m. -</b> We just saw it <b>south of Bush Pt, approaching Hansville</b>. We are looking through our "big eyes" (thanks to Center for Whale Research), and after repeated observations by both of us, we believe this isn't a humpback and is possibly/most likely a <b>Fin whale!</b> We have not seen it fluke, the fin does not look like a humpback, but the blow is more visible than a Minke's blow, and the fin is way back on this whale. It is traveling quite quickly continuing SE. Don't think we can get a photo from this distance, it is quite far south now - but if anyone is at Point no Point or can get there soon, we would LOVE a photo to confirm species on this whale! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:47 p.m. - Just passed Bush Point headed south</b>. -Gregory Roeben

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. -</b> humpback (turned out to be <b>a fin whale) SE bound into Admiralty Inlet</b>. Viewing from Fort Ebey - been watching for awhile travel in from the west. Appears to be mid channel and traveling steadily. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We saw what we took to be <b>a humpback, but what could have easily be a fin whale in Admiralty Inlet evening</b> of July 31st probably around<b> 5 pm</b>, maybe earlier. We were fishing and not paying a lot of attention to time. It was moving south toward Bush Point about mid-channel. (Was the fin whale- see our August 1st Sightings Report). -Glenn Barnett

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 30</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:30 p.m. - Leaving Transients at Bush Pt slowly northbound</b>. -Rob Sanderson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:05 p.m. - They are just SW of Bush Pt northbound</b>. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:50 p.m. - </b>Brad reports the <b>T65As and the T37s are rounding Double Bluff heading north</b> close to the shore.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:30ish between Point No Point and Whidbey. Closer to Whidbey</b>. -Jean Causbie

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:35 p.m. -</b> Brad Hanson of NW Fisheries Science Center reports <b>possibly 5 orcas heading north between Kingston and Point No Point</b>, in 2 groups about 1/2 mile apart.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:15 p.m. - </b>past mid channel <b>between Edmonds ferry and apple tree point</b>. Closer to west side. Steady northbound. -Sara Frey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:41 p.m. - Kingston ferry now.</b>
<br/><b>11:07 a.m. - We are with them north of skiff pt headed for Fay Bainbridge park</b>. -Rob Sanderson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. -</b> John Miller at WSFerries reports 4<b> orcas at Blakely Rock, off Bainbridge</b>, headed north.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Pod seen <b>east side of Blake island</b> for over an hour!! Not close enough to ID. -Laura Lippman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Voicemail from <b>8:42AM - Caller reports 5 orcas off Vashon Head</b>, at 42 31 7N by 122 28 7W, slapping water and jumping.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had <b>4 orcas in Useless Bay about 9am</b> this morning. Not common for us. What a treat. -Anne Proffitt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>The fin whale. East of Sequim</b>. It has been staying within an approx. 1 square mile area lately, indicating a solid food supply there. -James Gresham, July 30, 2016 
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:30 p.m. - We saw several whales (no dorsal fin, so not Orcas) on the crossing of the Coho between Victoria, BC &amp; Port Angeles, WA</b> in US waters. They appeared to be feeding, and heading west on Strait of Juan de Fuca. We did see the tail flukes of 2, one very close and distinct. One of our group got a video of them blowing and the tail of one, though it's fuzzy. We dont know if Grays or <b>Humpbacks</b> have been seen in the area, but that's best guess. -Elizabeth Blake

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Jess Payton took this picture of the <b>fin whale on Saturday about 4pm South of San Juan Island</b>, from the Blackfish San Juan Island Whale and Wildlife tour. Captain Tom did a great job getting us close -- but not too close -- to see several surfaces. -Sheryl Geuder Payton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Humpbacks in the morning and then WOW, J &amp; L Pod off Sooke in the afternoon</b>! -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:07 p.m. - orcas at Dilworth (northern end east side of Vashon)</b> mid channel slowly moving south. -Amy Carey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:53 p.m.  - WA State Ferries reports 3 orcas between Fauntleroy and Vashon, headed south</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:33 p.m. - We left them a little bit ago east of Blake Island heading south</b> still. They made a kill, had a celebration and then continued on. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:15 p.m. -</b> Amy Carey relayed a report of <b>orcas at north end of Vashon, east of Blake Island</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

First in a breach sequence of one of the <b>T037A's or T065A's</b> after they made a kill. From a surprise close encounter (no joke) to breaching, spyhopping, and tail lobbing to above (and below) water VOCALIZING T65A's and T37A's!! This has certainly been a season of firsts. Gotta love those T's. -Renee Beitzel, July 29, 2016 
 
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Members of the<b> T65As or T37As southbound passing Faye Bainbridge State Park</b>. -EB Photos

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 p.m. - </b>One group stayed east of mid channel and has now drifted back to mid or west of mid channel <b>due west of Shilshole</b>. Also blows to nortwest of that group. Connie Bickerton and her niece Elisabeth found <b>small group bit ago on Kitsap side off Faye Bainbridge also heading south</b>. Maybe pods meeting up again.
<br/><b>2:35 p.m. -</b> some have drifted back east of mid channel. Just watched them pass by out from<b> Carkeek Park</b>, north Seattle. Shilshole Marina/Golden Gardens would be next.
<br/><b>1:50 p.m. - orcas have moved way over towards Kitsap side</b>. Currently mid way between mid channel and Kitsap, south of yellow middle buoy <b>between Kingston and Jefferson Head/Indianola</b>. Steady southbound tight resting group.
<br/><b>1:15 p.m. -</b> they've moved off shore more mid channel now <b>between Edmonds Marina beach and Kingston ferry dock</b>. Still steady slow-med southbound travel.
<br/><b>12:30 p.m. -  still north of Edmonds ferry dock</b> about 1-1.5 miles from shore now grouped moving steady southbound after period of grouping, long dives, then surfacing near idle WW boat.
<br/><b>11:50 a.m. - </b>they've drifted south maybe 1/2mile with some directional changes, circling. And still surface active with tail lobs &amp; thrashing. Viewing from<b> Sunset Ave Edmonds</b>.
<br/><b>11:15 a.m. -</b> pod is still on same general area...<b>south of Possession Point</b> and approx 1.5 - 2 miles west of north Edmonds thrashing about. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Saw a group of <b>3-5 transients feeding on a harbor porpoise between 750am and 8am in west-central Useless Bay</b> (Whidbey). Batting the porpoise through the air. They appeared to depart the area pretty quickly after finishing with the porpoise. I couldn't get a good sense of which way they headed, unfortunately! -Nick Horton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Message from WA State Ferries <b>5:30 am this morning, reporting a whale in the middle of the traffic lanes outside Elliott Bay</b>, 1/2 nautical mile north of the Tango Buoy. (No species or direction of travel given, but our guess is that it <b>likely was one of the humpbacks</b> that has been hanging around)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:53 p.m. - </b>San Juan Channel - Spotted <b>2 Minke whales in San Juan channel</b>. Got lucky enough to see them breech. Heading south. (reporting party believes Minke, <b>Humpbacks were reported and confirmed by several others</b>- ALB) -Amy Ferron

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

...two <b>humpbacks</b> ...from the Victoria Clipper about <b>noon-2:30pm</b> Friday. Just <b>outside of Friday Harbor</b>. -Sheryl Geuder Payton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Humpbacks in the morning tour and then, J &amp; L Pod off Sooke (Juan de Fuca) in the afternoon</b>! Been a few days around here for our SRKW... GREAT TO SEA!..we are EXCITED! -Paul Pudwell

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
I am writing to report sighting a pod of about <b>12</b> bottle nose dolphins (<b>probably the Common dolphins</b>) near Devils Head at about <b>5 PM </b> July 29th they appeared to be feeding and very active, we were traveling by boat to Narrows Marina for dinner at the time, later on our return to Olympia we sited them again near Toliva Shoal about the same number 12 seemed to be actively feeding. I know what Harbor and Dall's porpoise look like these were clearly different gray with a bottle nose and the first I have ever observed in Puget Sound. -Larry Cowan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Saw a pod of about <b>12 Common dolphins off the South side of McNeil island Friday afternoon</b>. -Eric Devereaux, July 29, 2016  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:30 a.m. -</b> Beautiful video of one of the pods of <b>Common dolphins riding the wake. -Colvos Passage</b>, Puget Sound. -Paul Mooselips Dudley, July 29, 2016 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>T65A2 - Lovely day with some T65As and T37As south east of Dungeness Spit</b>. -Bonnie Gretz

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:13 p.m. - Seeing blows NW of Ebeys Landing</b>. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just spotted this <b>Gray (or Humpback) whale in Admiralty Inlet </b>heading south, just above Lagoon Point, about <b>8pm</b>. Figured it was a Gray since it was only the one and because of the spout, but I can't say for sure. (reported as Gray, but humpbacks have been consistently present). -James L. Bogart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Pod of Common dolphins - Olympia, WA</b> -Laurie O'Brien, July 28, 2016  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:50 p.m.  - Common Dolphins are "screaming" south down Eld Inlet</b>. What a lovely (and fast) sight of them porpoising just below the surface, throwing a wake, with every single animal. Throw in the total breaches once in a while and it's a grand night on the water. -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">July 27</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>Most of J pod had been spread out down San Juan Island all morning while J2, L87, the J16s, and the J19s had been found in Boundary Pass</b> and were heading south around Turn Point. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor in the early afternoon and left aboard Orcinus to go and pick up Ken over in Oak Bay on Vancouver Island. By the time Ken and Dave came back across Haro Strait, the southbound J pod whales were in Andrews Bay....Photos and full encounter report at CWR Encounter 75. -Center for Whale Research

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Sailed to <b>False Bay where members of J pod group B were foraging close to shore while group A was coming down from the north a little offshore. J27 Blackberry</b> breached multiple times leading a track to Salmon Bank. <b>Granny</b> was in the mix of the group B whales. Between the two groups was <b>a pair of humpback whales</b>. We sailed together to Salmon Bank and then all whales headed to Hein Bank and continued west into the sunset. -Barbara Bender

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I'm still reliving the amazing encounters. We watched the <b>J11s (J27, J31, and J39) traveling with J2 and adopted son, L87</b>. They sure seemed to be in high spirits ... J2 Granny (oldest southern resident orca) looking gorgeous. She and J27 spent more time out of the water than in it! And then there was <b>that humpback</b> that popped up surprisingly in the distance breaching over and over and over ...-Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:40 p.m. - West side.  They just passed quickly - L87 still offshore. J16s and J19s plus J2 with J26</b>! -Monika Wieland

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>J42 and I are on a roll! Here she is breaching by Monarch head</b> this morning! -Gary Sutton, July 27,2016 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:20 p.m. - 3 to 4 orcas in St of Juan de Fuca between Dungeness Spit and Ediz Hook</b>. Viewed at 7:20 PM from bluff at private residence on Osborn Rd mid-way between Dungeness Spit and Ediz Hook. 3 to 4 individuals only 1 male seen. Heading west towards Port Angeles. -Michael Scuderi

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Wednesday morning started out foggy, but the skies cleared and the sun came out just as our cruise was getting underway. We found the <b>T65s near Peapod Rocks</b>. We sat and watched them for quite some time as they fed and slapped their tails. As these 5 transients began to travel northbound, so did we. Just a bit further on we found this group of <b>transients again near Sister Islands</b> as they continued to feed and slap their tails! We spend an additional 45 minutes watching them before our return to port. -
Amy W.

One just never knows what wildlife we may see out on one of our excursions. We received word that some resident orcas trickled back into the area Sunday night, but they proved to be elusive on Monday. Today, however, they were back in good force! Captain Eric started this sunny, blustery day cruising towards <b>Salmon Bank, where we caught up with several small groups of orcas spread out near there, Eagle Point, and False Bay</b>. In total we estimate seeing between <b>10 and 12 members of J-pod </b>near these points. While we haven't made a positive ID yet, we believe one of the residents may have been bull J34, also known as Doublestuf. There were also a couple calves and several females.

There looked to be about 4 individuals - at least one with a taller broader fin. They were porpoising quickly towards the Strait at <b>6:49pm, I believe along the coast of Lopez </b>just before the ferry entered the channel between Shaw and Lopez.

WOW!! <b>J2 Granny, THE matriarch of an entire population, playing with a neonate harbor porpoise?! </b> J2 is possibly the oldest killer whale alive with an estimated birthday of 1911. She is a southern resident killer whale that feeds primarily on Chinook (king) salmon. J2 is the matriarch of the 83 southern resident killer whales that remain alive. Since this ecotype does not feed on mammals, this behavior is rare. It sure has scientists stumped ... Of course, it is also quite possible that this behavior happens more often than we know since we only see them a fraction of their day-to-day life. During the encounter, <b>J2 played with the porpoise</b>, pushing it around on her rostrum, back, side and would peridcially let it go to chase it down again. At the end of the encounter, she thrashed the baby harbor porpoise around a bit then left to join her adopted son, L87 Onxy who was waiting patiently about 300 yards away while she did her thing. Want to know the most interesting part? <b>The neonate porpoise actually survived</b>, for the time being at least. In other rare instances that have been observed where southern resident individuals "play" with harbor porpoise neonates, they actually play with them to death and usually drown. J2 knew just how much pressure to put on this neonate and deliberately did not kill it. This was indeed a rare behavior to witness. -Heather MacIntyre

The footage - Facebook Video  - is of <b>Granny playing with a small porpoise 7/21/16 off Pender Island. Onyx was by her side</b> for about 15 minutes as she played a cat and mouse game with the dolphin. Eventually she came right along side us pushing the little porpoise along. About 10 minutes later she lost interest. The porpoise was seen twice afterwards swimming and surfacing. Granny and Onyx continued on their way north. We were on a whale watch tour with Salt Spring Island Adventure Co. Very unusual activity. -Joy McFate Lee

Another magnificent day on the Salish Sea! On the way north, we checked out some fat harbor seals, including the young reddish pup. Caught up with <b>two orcas, a male and female, just south of Eagle Point on San Juan Island</b>, and caught a few glimpses in between their very long dive times. With a report of orcas coming in from the west, we headed out and found <b>L94 Calypso, and her young son L121 Windsong</b>, with daughter <b>L113 Cousteau</b> following. As they sped toward San Juan Island, we were able to get great looks at this lovely family, including some with beautiful Mt. Baker in the background. As we left them to find other wildlife, they had formed up in a tight group, still heading very swiftly toward the other whales spread out all along Haro Straight, mostly heading north toward the Frasier Rive and hopefully a lot of salmon. <b>Out by Hein Bank we found 4-5 minke whales</b>, with a close encounter of the minke kind, to get a really good look at these beautiful small baleen whales. A splendid day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

We first encounter <b>L41 who was a mile or more offshore</b> heading inshore away from us. At first it was difficult to get a sense of how many whales were present as they were very spread out. We then spotted L25 as she swam a bit more inshore steadily northbound. <b>L119 and mom L77</b> were nearby. The two separated for a short time when L77 seemingly alone headed in our direction then turned parallel several hundred yards inshore of us and just behind L119 who was full of spunk. After a nice breach,  L41 eventually turned in and approached others inshore as did <b>L55 &amp; L119</b> where eventually all the L11s (heard the L22s were there too) grouped up and porpoised for a minute somewhere around Pile Point.

The first whale we found was<b> L-85 Mystery</b> (born 1991) with his 6' dorsal fin, a beautiful sight. Fairly close by we found a group of L-pod whales -<b> L-77, L-94 and calf L-121</b>, and several other members of their family. We had wonderful views as they interacted on the surface, in very calm sea conditions. Then we learned of Humpback whales - in the path of our homebound trip! We headed eastbound - and saw<b> three Minke whales</b> on the way to viewing <b>at least TEN Humpback whales</b> - WOW. A couple of these whales appeared to be quite friendly as they approached the boat - we were all in awe at the close looks and size of these whales. Along with harbor porpoise, turkey vultures, bald eagles and a newborn seal pup, it was truly a magical day!

On July 15th at roughly <b>9am I saw two orcas a few hundred yards off Carmet beach in Sonoma County CA</b>. They were heading north, moving relatively slowly and sticking around a disturbance in the water, most likely some kind of feeding behavior as I saw sea birds in the area as well. It was a bit too far out to note any specific distinguishing features of individuals, but I thought I'd let you know as it is the first time I'd seen an orca in the area. -Skylar deWitte

...We saw our first group of <b>whales at 1002 heading north inshore of us between Eagle Point and False Bay</b>. This group included the <b>L55's along with L105 and J31</b> and they got by us with just a few proof of presence photos taken. We kept moving south in hopes of finding members of the <b>L12's (the L11's, L22's, L85, and L25-L87 is also a L12</b> but he was up north with the rest of J pod). 
We saw a male and a female inshore at Eagle Point and this turned out to be L22 and L89. These two milled briefly at the point before heading slowly south. Another boat reported that they had J27 a ways offshore of us. The J11's had not been with the rest of J pod when they had been inside the past week so it was interesting that they came in with the L's....

Absolutely beautiful, sunny, calm day on the Salish Sea! We had early reports of Southern Resident orcas "all over"....We slowed down to take a brief look at some chubby harbor seals and their pups, including one reddish one, which is unusual. We first caught up with the big male, <b>L41 Mega</b>, who is 39 years old, as he surfaced within great viewing distance. As all the whales were spread out, hunting for salmon, we saw brief glimpses of others, but enjoyed Mega's presence for a while. We then moved closer to San Juan Island, <b>around False Bay and Eagle Point</b>, to delight in the antics of <b>L121 Windsong</b>, who is now about 16 months old, with his mom <b>L94 Calypso</b>. Also seen with this group were the female <b>L22 Spirit</b>, who is estimated to be 45 years old, and the male, <b>Mystery, L85</b>, who is 25 years old. (final I.D.'s to be confirmed) With reports of<b> multiple humpbacks</b> out by the Romeo Alpha buoy, we motored out and had a wonderful encounter with <b>two of these majestic baleen whales</b>, who stuck very close together. We saw <b>at least 5 others</b> in the distance, and there were perhaps 15-20 to the west. We are so lucky to have these beautiful giants increasing their presence in Puget Sound. On the way home, two bald eagles were spotted and a harbor seal surround by gulls, enjoyed a fish feast. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Trip report - It's always good to hear that whales are close by, but really exciting that they're <b>members of J-pod</b> - still in our waters - and hopefully finding enough food! We headed towards the west side of San Juan Island where they were doing their "west side shuffle", traveling very close to shore, and were able to identify J<b>-26 Mike, J-16 Slick with her calf J-50</b>, and several other members of the <b>J16s and J22s (and possibly the J17s</b>) - always a delight to see them. We had a fleeting glimpse of <b>a Minke whale</b> on our return trip, with several Steller sea lions resting on a channel marker, some harbor seals, and eagles. And it was a really beautiful sunny day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Such a joy to see <b>J-pod in the inland waters for the fourth consecutive day</b> after a somewhat prolonged absence... It was a short trip from the dock to <b>Rosario Strait, where J pod were southbound in Thatcher Pass</b>. The whales were actively feeding with some rapid porpoising in pursuit of prey, many powerful tail and pectoral fin slaps to stun their quarry, and an occasional spy-hop and breach. Little ones were keeping close tabs on Mom, swimming in her slipstream, the area of least resistance. It's all about family, and to see these whales in their close-knit groups and natural surroundings of the Pacific Northwest was a joy to behold. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist and Author

Trip report - It was a magical day today as we found <b>J-pod whales</b> a half hour from port!! We connected with many of these amazing icons by Decatur Island, very spread out, traveling slowly southbound (the <b>J22s, J16s and J17s</b>). Many of the group passed close to shore by<b> Burrows Lighthouse</b>, continuing south <b>past Deception Pass </b>and thrilling beach goers at Deception Pass State Pass. We took a sight-seeing trip under Deception Pass Bridge, and when back in Rosario Strait we headed to see yet more whales - near Colville Island on the south end of Lopez Island.

He decided to go on a breach-a-palooza, popping off 100+ breaches and/or chin slaps, and threw in a few tail throws for good measure. I'm not exaggerating, we all lost count after about 30, and even had to leave for a while to get out of the way of a military vessel and he was still at it when we reconnected.

July 7-9 report: 
<br/>It's been awesome having J-Pod around for a week straight, the kind of thing we expect this time of year, but had not experienced in May and June! <b>On July 7th, the J2s (J2, L87, and the J14s) and J19s headed north past Lime Kiln around 3 PM</b>. We left them heading north off Turn Point at 6 PM.
<br/><b>On July 8th, the J2s and J19s started passing Lime Kiln going north around 4 PM</b>. The rest of J-Pod (minus the J11s) was inbound, however, and just as we saw the whale-watching boats rounding Discovery Island, the J2s and J19s veered out and went to meet them. All the whales met up in the middle of the straights and headed back towards San Juan, "hitting" the island around False Bay. At 6:30 PM some whales started going north again past Lime Kiln, including the J2s, J19s, and J17s. Whales were in sight to the north and south not really going anywhere around 7:45 PM. From our boat, we met up with the northern whales at about <b>8:30 off Stuart Island, where they were very spread out and still going north</b>, making beautiful vocalizations in the quiet evening.
<br/>At some point during the night, the J22s and J16s must have gone north, because <b>at 11 AM on July 9th, all present J-Pod matrilines headed south past Lime Kiln</b>, spread out and well offshore. <b>At 3:30 PM, however, as they made their way back north past Lime Kiln, they gave us shore-based whale watchers the passby we've been waiting for this season, with lots of surface activity and playing in the kelp.

<b>6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. - Part of J pod had been in since July 3rd (J2, L87, J14s and J19s)</b>. Morning time brought word of more incoming (or eastbound Juan de Fuca Strait) residents.  This group turned out to be <b>the rest of J pod minus the J11s</b>. Both groups ended up <b>in Haro Strait off the west side of San Juan Island</b>, spread out quite a distance, and moving in all directions. Around <b>6:00 p.m. we caught up with what turned out to be the J16s (and possibly others) off False Bay</b>. Sweetly, the first whales we encountered were<b> J16 Slick and her 19 month-old daughter J50 Scarlett</b> who were first heading south then soon made directional change heading north, then south, then in circles. J16's family, daughters: J36 Alki  and her son 17 month-old J52 Sonic; and 9 year-old <br/><b>J42 Echo were foraging for Chinook salmon</b>. <b>J16s eldest offspring, 25-year-old son J26 Mike was to the north</b> and much further offshore. After spending time with the inshore whales we turned northwest to spend time with J26. No sooner had the boat gone idle did he veer towards us in a zig zag pattern. With engines now cut J26 headed right for us and dove under our bow where I stood. A meaningful moment to say the least. He continued on southbound, still zigzagging and well offshore. Soon after he veered inland all the while in foraging mode. We left the group still spread, with moms and calves inland and Mike still further off around 7:00 p.m. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

We were lucky to catch up with <b>J-Pod (Group B) in Canadian waters yesterday, 4 of the new group of babies were there</b>...J-28 Polaris with her 7-month-old son J-54. We did the full distance today when hearing "incoming J-Pod members" near Race Rocks, west of Victoria BC! Fortunately the tides were in our favor, outbound and inbound, and what a thrill to find <b>J-Pod group B whale</b>s, who hadn't been seen in the Salish Sea for a while. Four of the newest babies were there - a real treat. As they slowly traveled east, we heard that <b>J-Pod group A whales were near our homeport of Anacortes!</b> So homeward bound, we picked up Group A by Cattle Point, on San Juan Island, heading north - traveling very close to shore. <b>L-87 Onyx</b> who travels with this group, was off-shore so we caught a good look at him. Wow, what a day, long but included with all these whales were seals, a Steller sea lion, bald eagles AND a Minke whale!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Caught up with members of <b>J pod off Henry Island split in 3 groups. L87 on the outside, a group of 6 in the middle and 2 much closer land</b>. Steady northbound with a pause in the rip for a few breaches &amp; tail lobs, and possibly chasing a salmon. Steady progression north mostly with occasional bursts of activity. Out from Spieden Island a succession of tail lobs by several in the pod, and they all kept their course. Just south of Stuart Island we headed east towards inshore whales, one of who engaged in multiple breaches. We left with them still steadily northbound SW of Stuart Island just after 5:00 p.m.
<br/>Yep, <b>those 10 whales! J19s, J14, and J45 were middle group inside of Onyx. J37 was breacher near J49. J2 was in their vicinity and J40 was way inshore by herself.</b> Thanks to Monika Wieland for help with ID's and who was where. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

The subgroup of <b>J Pod comprised of J2 et. al. was found mid-day near the south end of Lopez Island</b> as they were <b>coming back toward Haro Strait along the coastline of Lopez</b>. Ken launched in "Shachi" to encounter the <b>very spread out group</b> as the whales came toward False Bay, San Juan Island following their typical foraging pattern. The encounter began at <b>1433just off Pile Point</b>  with the whales very spread out moving northwest against the ebbing tide just as it was turning to flood. The whale-watching boats were very disciplined and staying in a line about one half mile offshore of San Juan Island as the whales swam along conducting very long and unpredictable dives in the corridor between the shore and the vessel-based observers. L87 was the offshore flanking whale, and he zigged and zagged a half mile or so between surfacings with very unpredictable intervals on either side of the line of boats...

Have not seen many of these this season. About a dozen vessels traveling slowly from east to west with one large specimen (Clipper) joining the pod from the west. Pod generally stayed close together with a sailboat tour hugging the shore and a few others meandering in search of great photo opportunities. Did notice several humans leaning over railings but no spy hops or breaches or slashing. There may have been feeding activity on the larger vessels.
This activity was viewed by<b> about a dozen orcas as they cruised past heading to the west</b> in two tightly packed groups and one solo male. The orcas had an enjoyable time, glad they decided to visit <b>Iceberg Point, Lopez Island</b> and hope they do this tour several more times this summer. -Sally Reeve

A surprise to see these <b>9 precious Jpod whales (including L87) at the Fraser River two days in a row</b>. Their presence and behaviour would indicate they are being somewhat successful foraging here for right now. They have been spread out between the north and south arm of the river. We were fortunate enough to get good looks at the <b>J19 matriline a few times. J40 "Suttles" was with them and J51 "Nova" </b>has been full of beans apparently. J51 on his grandmother's back. J19 and J41 appeared to be rounding up a fish when this happened. Maybe J51 was a little to eager for a chunk of salmon from his patient grandma. -Tasli Shaw

I watched <b>4 Orca, 1 large male, 2 females (?), and I believe a young of the year, at the NE side of Miners Bay, Mayne Island at 0930 </b>this morning.  They were very active, surfacing a lot from shallow dives (the water is fairly shallow there), but all 4 were very active.  Watched for 10 minutes; they played in the same area all the time. The male was distinctly large and I would describe his dorsal as shapely, in profile (smaller in the middle), if that helps. -Frank Gee, Parks Canada staffer

After leaving the <b>Bigg's Transient killer whales near Kelp Reef (Encounter 65)</b>, Ken headed north to <b>Turn Point to meet with Granny's subgroup of J pod that was spreading out and foraging</b> in the very active swirls of incoming tide off the point. Presumably, an aggregation of salmon was riding in with the fast moving tide flow, but the sea surface was so turbulent that it was impossible to detect any predation events. <b>J19 and J41 </b>were the west flanking whales and <b>J14, J37 and J49 </b>were the east flanking whales while <b>J2 and L87 charged in a zig zag pattern down the middle </b>of the tide rips that shot up vertically like haystacks of water, dousing the boat and camera.

Nice and close to home, we had our own 4th of July Parade with <b>Transient/Biggs killer whales off Lopez Island</b> today. As they traveled<b> by the Lopez ferry terminal and continued on around Shaw Island</b>, we had some excellent views of the three of them, <b>T123 (mom, born 1985), son T123A already a large male at only 16 years of age, and little sister T123C, born in 2012</b>. They passed by several nervous seals hauled out on nearby rocks, so were not in hunting mode, lucky for the seals! After great looks and local inter-island sight-seeing, we glimpsed these three again before heading back to port ..... finding a mom seal with her newborn pup, and bald eagles! What a great 4th of July, back in port in time for the festivities. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Mark and Hannah Malleson encountered <b>"J pod" in the morning inbound near Race Passage</b> in pretty rough water. The whales had been reported earlier off Otter Point as a 'big group' but <b>there were only J2, L87, and the J14's and J19's in a spread pattern</b> as they continued inbound. Ken was returning from Sequim by automobile/ferry so did not get out on the water in "Shachi" until 1620, and then it was only to photo-document J2 before fueling the boat to be ready if more residents come in.
<br/>Notes-Comments: The continuing pattern of only a few residents widely spread can be correlated with the Chinook salmon pattern of relatively few fish making it to the Fraser River Albion test fishery nets. This is another bad year for Chinook salmon in the SRKW core summer habitat!...  See photos and full report at CWR Encounter 64. -Center for Whale Research

<b>8:00 a.m. -</b> I heard blows and I spotted what I think was <b>a small Gray Whale in the middle of Saratoga Passage</b> swimming southbound toward Langley at about 8:00 am this morning. -Sydney Lynn Wolcott

Saw <b>6 Orca being mobbed by whale watching boats, between Turn Point</b> (US side of Boundary Passage) and Fairfax Point (south end of Moresby Island), east of the marker for Helen Rock (I think it is called?). They were traveling steadily northwards, but I didn't see exactly where they headed. Gotta love these work days, -Frank Gee, Parks Canada staffer
