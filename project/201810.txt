Alert Bay - Just as we were getting ready for Halloween, Tasli noticed some tail lobbing right in front of our place <b>up here in Alert Bay</b>! We walked outside the house and <b>T049C</b> started breaching right in front! We walked along the beach watching him cruise in and out of the kelp beds along the Cormorant Island shoreline. Happy Halloween!! -Gary Sutton

Tue Oct 31 - South Puget Sound - <b>15:35 - </b>Beth Swanson submitted this report: <b>2, possibly 3 orcas heading west spotted south of Anderson Island</b>. Just now. Crossed in front of the ferry. 1 male for sure. 1 or 2 females. Unable to ID as they were too far off in choppy water. Traveling fast.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:04 -</b> They went into<b> Carr Inlet</b> and I lost sight of them. There were 4-6 I think, hard to count. One big male and then maybe 3-5 smaller fins.
<br/><b>2:38 south end fox island </b>headed toward McNeil! -Lissa Brod Anderson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>from Anderson Island</b>, we briefly saw them close to Fox shore around <b>2:10 westbound</b>, but nothing since. I strongly suspect the may have headed <b>between Fox and McNeil toward Carr Inlet</b>. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:57 -</b> My dad lives on the South End of <b>Fox Island </b>(facing Steilacoom), the orcas are currently in front of his house, headed towards McNeil Island. -Gaby Kinner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:54 - Orcas </b>past us almost at McNeil...we were at <b>Chambers Bay</b> Pier Walkway and they were about 1/4 of a mile out going towards either McNeil or Anderson Island.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:10 -</b> They <b>(orcas)</b> are foraging here (<b>south of Narrows</b> close to Kitsap side). No apparent direction of travel. -Karen Caldwell

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:59 -</b> the <b>orcas are south of the bridge</b> now - tail lobs. I think they may have been hunting. Mostly milling. But tending south currently...Definitely at least 6. One tiny one. Still trending south. (This video (not including in this report - alb) is from my phone, so poor quality, but I'm sharing it because I was capturing the orcas and the humpback together, so you can see how close they were. This was at 11:41 this morning. The orcas are to the right. When I panned to the left, the blow was from the humpback. Amazing morning!)
<br/><b>11:36- They (orcas) are milling under the bridge. 4 for sure</b>.
<br/><b>11:30 - THERE ARE ORCAS UNDER THE BRIDGE!!! 4-8 heading north!!'</b> -Heidi Armstrong

We received a phone call around 11 a.m. about a possible humpback in distress across from Narrows Park. When Science Specialist Stena Troyer and Communications Specialist Carly Vester arrived, the <b>humpback </b>was okay and steadily moving through... and <b>a small pod of orcas</b> were coming in! The pod swam <b>under the Narrows bridge around 11:30 a.m</b>. and stayed in the area <b>until at least 12:15</b> p.m, potentially later. There were at least 6 orcas, including a juvenile who was splashing, flipping its tail, and at one point rolled in the water! Meanwhile, near-shore, several sea lions and harbor seals were staying safely away from the orcas. Check out the video in the comment section as well of the orcas passing by. Members of the <b>T46 matriline</b> southbound at Tacoma Narrows Bridge. What a Halloween treat! -Harbor Wildwatch

<b>11:25 - (Humpback</b>) He's moved south of the bridge &amp; seems to be traveling &amp; surfacing now.
<br/>10:44 - I thought the whale (Humpback) would have moved on by now but he is<b> still under the bridge</b> - very active. Lots of splashing, tail throws. Residents who live nearby say this behavior has been going on for 2 hours &amp; are concerned- wondering if this is normal or if something might be wrong. -Heidi Armstrong
<br/>(<i>all was well with Vivaldi, there was some concern about the prolonged surface activity until it was sorted out there were orcas in the same area on a kill - alb</i>)

Wandered down to the harbour here and saw <b>3 orcas: one adult female and two young orcas from 16:30 to 16:45 in the Sidney harbour</b> between the two large fishing piers. Saw three sequences; last sighting was <b>within 20m of shore </b>in front of a small beach right in town, with all three surfacing. Saw the tail fin out sideways so unsure if feeding or playing. Expected them back up and stayed till 17:30 but no luck. Seemed like Southern Resident dorsal fins but I'm out of practice - I had thought Residents traveled in larger groups, so wondering if these were transients. In close to shore too. No other marine mammals visible. -Cheers, Brian McHattie

Sunday about <b>noon</b> we were taking a hike through <b>Pt Defiance and stopped at Dalco passage Viewpoint</b> "just in case" the juvenile <b>Humpback</b> was still hanging around and to our delight it was, with the same energy and delight it has been showing folks down near <b>Owen Beach, Vashon Island ferry dock and Dalco Passage </b>for the last 10 days. It has been a wonderful added treat to a glorious autumn. I have ventured down to the beach every 3rd day or so to check and it appears to have a similar pattern to the comment below on the gray whale near Olympia. 3-4 loud blows and then a deep dive, then we patiently wait for what seems forever before we hear and see the water spray again. I love this site which keeps us updated on when and where our magnificent creatures remind us of this big glorious world we live in. BTW on Friday, as we followed the travel of this  Humpback from Owen Beach toward the Narrows Bridge, we came up on a huge pod of seals or sea lions below the cliffs. The water was so clear and you could see them playing under the water and enjoying the day. They were very close to shore about 20-30 of them. -Monia Janek Herlocker

Sat Oct 27 - With the end of our field season just a few days away, we had what may likely be our last official research encounter of 2018 this evening off the north end of <b>Orcas Island</b>. It included two new groups to us - the <b>T35As and T38As - plus the T123s with a new calf </b>in tow. We'll share some end of season thoughts next week, but for now, a moment of Zen. (See OBI Facebook VIDEO)

<br/><b>17:30 - These Ts  (T35s, T38s, &amp; T123s)</b> heading SE <b>between Orcas and Matia</b>. So thankful to have met the newest little munchkin on the block this evening - <b>T123D</b>, first seen earlier this month. Also check out the unique white pigmentation spot on the dorsal fin of T38A, another new whale for me. -Monika Wieland Shields

DOLPHINS - Sat Oct 27 - I am emailing to report <b>two dolphins seen in the Hood Canal</b> today. Probably the same two that were spotted earlier this week. I don't know what kind, but I have seen them (this type) before. Dark color and large. Two seen at <b>9:15 am</b> Saturday, Oct. 27th about <b>two miles north of Lilliwaup</b>, heading north in the middle of the canal.  Looked like they were traveling out at a pretty good speed.  Sorry, no photos.
<i>ON staff sent Jeni some info and photos for comparison:</i> Thank you for the photos! Very helpful. I'm thinking<b> bottlenose</b> because of the well defined, bigger fin and longer body.  I have seen this type of dolphin in the canal before (like I saw Sat.). The pace they move at, fin and body size....Surely someone else saw them that day?  I hope so, and that they can identify them! -Jeni Gray

DOLPHINS - Sun Oct 21 - I was out this morning (Sunday 10.21) around <b>7:30</b> and heard the sound of air coming out of a blowhole about 200(?) yards off the old ferry dock in <b>Gig Harbor</b>. I managed to isolate the area as I kept hearing the air through the blowhole sound. I managed to get a few so-so shots of the animal and I was wondering if you could help me identify what type of dolphin (I assume it was a dolphin) it was. It was swimming alone. After about 5 minutes or so, it did not come back up anywhere near where I was watching. I have attached the photo(s) for you. -Thanks. Jeff Hurdus
<br/>(<i>That is almost certainly a <b>bottlenose dolphin</b>. I can't be as certain that it is Stump, because the trailing edge of the dorsal fin isn't clear enough. It is roughly the right shape for her dorsal, and she was in the South Sound last week, so there is a good chance that it is her. -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

PORPOISE - Sun Oct 21 - Keep seeing two things surfacing with dorsal fins <b>in the Hood Canal by Lilliwaup</b>. I got a closer look at them today and it looked like dolphins.  Is that possible?

Thu Oct 18 - <b>15:16 - Dolphins</b>???!!! There were Witnesses this time, too!my pictures were still crap, I was literally getting ready to leave and had to throw it back in park and jump out....Thank you for the clarification, they were definitely some small dolphins. I was just very excited, before this week I didn't know that we got humpbacks or dolphins over here. Never even seen a whale or dolphin in real life. The last 4 days have been very exciting for me. -Johnny Collard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Reply later in the evening: Johnny Collard you likely saw a porpoise/dolphin it was swimming around there and in front of <b>Owen beach</b>...about <b>2:00-2:30</b> today (Thursday) very close to shore. Swimming west...It first appeared by showing it's dorsal fin. It did the dolphin type bobbing up and down. Grey. -Monica Janke Herlocker

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:44 - </b>There's something with a large dorsal fin swimming around, maybe 30 feet away over by Anthony's. Is there anyone that can attest, and maybe shed some light on what I saw? It popped out of the water twice, and it was a darker grey I believe. I wasn't able to get my phone out fast enough to get a decent picture. Just kind of a blur..Johnny Collard

10/17 on Chilkat Express with our 3rd whale trifecta in a row!! We encountered <b>2 Humpback Whales</b> apparently having an intense social interaction <b>near Possession Bank</b>. It was <b>"Two Spot" in hot pursuit of "Zephyr"</b> who trumpeted loudly with every breath as the two sped toward the Kitsap Peninsula. Then, we found a <b>Minke Whale near Port Townsend </b>(not pictured) then spotted two more off in the distance from Eastern Bank. To top it off, we met up with <b>Gray Whale #185 </b>feeding in shallow water near Mabana Beach on Camano Island. Beautiful weather, and lots of smaller critters as well, but I didn't manage to get any pictures of them. -Justine Buckmaster
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:18 -</b> We left them (<b>CS631/CRC16017 and MMZ0004</b>) heading quickly toward Eglon. <b>Zephyr was trumpeting as Two Spot </b>pursued her, both moving fast.

<b>Point Defiance, Dalco Passage, Point Ruston, Vashon Island.</b>..one of the most beautiful fall days ever...I got to meet <b>Vivaldi (humpback)</b> for the first time.

...interesting group of <b>transients heading east off Dungeness Spit</b>. Along with the <b>T35As and T38As</b>, a male known as <b>U57</b> and several other unknown whales were reported to be with them...Along with the <b>six T35As and T38As</b>, there were four new whales other than U57...Besides U57, Jared says the other male is known as <b>U56</b> and both are the probable sons of a two nicked female known as <b>U36</b>. A medium sized juvenile present was <b>U36A</b>. The second unknown female sized whale who was present was <b>U137</b>. U137 seems to belong to the U36 group but his/her relationship to the others is unknown. Jared says DFO only has a few records of this group from near the shelf edge off northern Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii.

Started our day in the marina with a bald eagle, a seal and some other birds which I will add later. Five minutes off the dock we found our friend <b>Two Spot the humpback</b>, then we saw <b>another humpback named Masquerade/Cyclone</b> and then a <b>third HB named Zephyr</b>!! We were fortunate to be able to watch Two Spot lunge feed into a bird pile before we left to find more wildlife!
Out in the Strait of Juan de Fuca Captain Brian was looking for whales and about 3 and 1/2 miles away he saw some!! Turned out to be appx. 10 transient orcas including <b>T38A's, T35A's and U56, U57, U36, U36A, U137</b>. The "U's" have never been recorded or photographed in this area before, so we actually got the first photos of them here as it was our Captain that found them!
The other whales do not visit here very often so it was an amazing encounter to see all of them!! There was a minke whale in the area as well so we got to see the trifecta!...Janine Harles, Puget Sound Express

10/15 on the Chilkat Express!! Wow, what another amazing day!

Our journey continued north where we found <b>at least 10 Transient Killer Whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>. Not just any Ts, these are infrequent visitors to this area. My first time meeting the<b> T35s, T38As, U57, U58 and others(?)</b>. Thanks to all who helped us ID these new to us orcas! -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

Sat Oct 13 - Saratoga Passage, North Puget Sound - Thanks to sharp eyed, and eared, neighbors I just had a chance to see our overwintering?<b> gray whale</b>. Just south of<b> Mabana, Camano Island</b>, close to shore at <b>9 AM </b>high tide, heading south. Interestingly, I had noted a flock of Scoter feeding in front of the house yesterday and had thought it was strange they were there this time of year. They were acting just like earlier in the Spring when the the gray whale are feeding and they follow along for the feast. The neighbors say the whale has been around most of the week. -Barbara Brock

Thu Oct 11- Gulf Islands - It's Frank, from Parks Canada. We were out today and sighted a <b>humpback whale off Bedwell Harbour</b>, South Pender Island at <b>1430</b> today. It was about 300 M off the shore. No pics of the tail; the sun was behind the whale. This whale seemed to be particularly large, compared to some others I have seen. The whale surfaced unexpectedly, quite close to us (less than 200M; no indication it was in the area as we had a couple kms of clear view). It took 3 breathes and then dove. It resurfaced off Gowland Point as it moved east along Boundary Pass. We were headed west. -Frank Gee, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve

Looking towards Vashon, just in front of the ferry slip I saw a single whale start a dive. About three minutes later looking towards the southern shore I spotted a large spout and a smaller one right afterwards, just to the west of the ferry lanes. The dorsal fins were small and the backs broad. Definitely not orcas. I did see the tail flukes but the distance was too great to note any details. (<i>unconfirmed but sounds like humpbacks - alb</i>). -Mitch Kent

Tue -Thu Oct 9-11 - South Puget Sound - There has been <b>a whale just off the west-facing shore of Harstine Island, in Pickering Passage, about halfway between Squaxin Island and the Harstine Island Bridge</b>. I first saw it right in front of my house Wednesday afternoon (10th), but my neighbor said he had seen it the day before (9th). The whale was still swimming in the water in front of my house when I left for work about <b>7:00 pm last night (Thursday - 11th)</b>. I do not see/hear him this morning (report sent Oct 12th). He was truly a magnificent sight. Although he/she never lept completely out of the water it would come to the surface and blow water about every 15 seconds 3 or 4 times and then dive for about 5 minutes before surfacing again. It seemed to go on all day and all night. I will never forget the distinctive sound of the blowing whale. I feel so lucky to have seen this. -Karen Jensen

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Trip report - on our last scheduled whale watch trip for 2018, we set off under rainy skies through the San Juan Islands towards <b>Spieden Island</b>, where whales had been spotted! We found the <b>T49As</b> again, a family of 5 whales (mom and 4 kids) and had great views of them, between a few rain drops, but also enjoying beautifully calm seas. We left the whales trending <b>towards Waldron Island</b>, and we continued to Sucia Island to see Steller sea lions and harbor seals. Several bald eagles were spotted, and when almost back to port, lots of harbor porpoise. An ice-cream for all passengers rounded out the end of a wonderful 2018 season!! Thanks you Mystic Sea!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Oct 6 (into Oct 7) - <b>Transient calls lasted until a 1/2 hour after midnight</b>. Since the <b>T49As and the T65As</b> had been in the area and some of them had evidently split into different groups, going different directions (during daylight), I wonder if they were getting back together in the dark of night. And maybe it was someone else completely!

Three separate elephant seal sightings including one near Elliot Bay and even a brown pelican in Commencement Bay. Thanks for all you do!  
More from Kevin Campion: Sadly no photos but 100% certain of the Dall's id. We saw a small group Friday the 5th at Robinson point and then over a dozen yesterday the 7th just north of Vashon. Loads of harbor porpoise as well on Sat. and Sunday south of Tacoma Narrows. We were surprised by the Dall's as well it has been since 2014 since I have seen any down in Puget Sound.

Trip Report: Another splendid, sunny day aboard Mystic Sea! After we cleared Guemas Channel, we headed north through the San Juan Islands, and happily caught up with the <b>T49As and T65As </b>(Transient aka Bigg's orcas) at the <b>north end of San Juan Island</b>. One group was fairly spread out, trending northwest and we stayed with them for awhile. We then visited with the second group, near Waldron Island. This group of <b>four, 2 large males and two smaller ones</b>, split to go <b>around Battleship Island</b>, then turned north in the sparkling sunshine.<b> The T49A group are T49A (matriarch, born 1986), son T46A1 (born 2001), T49A2 (born 2007), son T49A3 (born 2011), and T49A4 (born 2014). The T65A group (who we have been lucky to see a lot this season) are T65A (matriarch, born 1986), son T65A2 (born 2004), son T65A3 (born 2007), daughter T65A4 (born 2011), T65A5 (born 2014), and calf T65A5 (born April 2018).</b> We then checked out the exotic deer and sheep on Spieden Island, and made our way back to Cap Sante marina. Such a privilege to see these magnificent orcas! It's been a wonderful season, with splendid weather (mostly!) and splendid whales. Thanks to Captains Monte and Eric and all the great crew members, and Amy Wood at the office, to all our wonderful passengers! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

COASTAL KILLER WHALES - Oct 6 - Approx. midday, Saturday 6th October 2018 I was on a Pelagic Birding trip out of <b>Westport to Grays Canyon approx 35 miles out</b>. We came across a large flock of seabirds that was picking up the scraps from a<b> pod of Orcas. At least 5</b> in size. Mostly young and females. There may have been a young Male. Photographs were taken and if you check with Phil or Chris Anderson they may know the individuals you can contact to get the pictures. We had to have been amongst them for an hour at least. They were aggressively hunting and feeding. The Capt Phil says they rarely encounter Orcas on their trips and maybe once a season only do they see any. -Mark Girling

Trip report - on this rainy day we headed west via the San Juan Islands, with no reports of whales at all, scanning for those familiar dorsal fins - and on a hunch Capt Eric headed towards East Point but before arriving there, we heard "WHALES!" on the radio. The<b> T49A family</b> was found heading towards <b>Flat-top Island, Gull Rock and onwards to Spieden Island</b>. Then came the <b>T65A group</b> and the two groups joined up on the north side of Spieden. What a treat to see these Biggs/Transient whale families - great viewing even with light rain falling. A fun day - well done Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

<b>5 Orcas Off Shore of Perego's Lagoon</b>: Hello, On Oct. 2nd, at about 11:50 am, we spotted 5 orcas while we were hiking the bluff above Perego's Lagoon just north of Ebey's Landing on the <b>west side of Whidbey Island</b>. They were close enough to shore to see with the naked eye from the high bluff, but far enough out that we needed to use our binoculars to see their markings well. They were heading south. One looked to be smaller than the others, but we are inexperienced whale spotters, so we're not sure if we judged size correctly. Thank you for the work you do. -Maria Mitchell
