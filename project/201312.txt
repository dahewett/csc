<b>7:29 Bigg's (Transients) calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophones</b>. - Orca Network 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

New years eve<b> 23.30 to 23.45 in Elliott bay just NW of pier 70, a pod of at least 4 Orcas swam along with the sail boat</b> as we navigated through the party boats. We had opted to sail in the light wind while waiting for the fireworks. They appeared and seemed to follow around the boat as we transitioned through the party boats till we reached clear(er) water. Then we saw them no more. They appeared to be swimming calmly around us as we traveled at about 3 knots. We saw 4 fins at one time, but the pod was probably larger than that. We saw several tale flukes and heads. They seemed calm. Their accompaniment lasted about 15 min. We gave notice to the other mariners of their presence on Marine VHF Ch 16. - Brian Scally

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Rebecca Sherwood reported being visited by <b>8-10 orcas in Elliot Bay</b> while aboard their boat for New Years Eve celebrations last night at <b>11:30pm</b>. She reports they saw the pod leaving them heading to the north. Everyone keep your eyes on the water and let us know if you catch sight of the whales. Fog has lifted in some areas revealing a beautiful New Years day.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

New Year's Eve Orcas. The <b>11:35 p.m. sailing from Bainbridge to Seattle </b>was filled with New Year's revelers and <b>slowed for much of the sailing for orcas</b> reported in the area. One passenger I spoke to saw at least 3 fins. A great way to end 2013. - Cathy Warner

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I too was on a boat in <b>Elliott bay</b> last night. Right <b>at midnight an entire pod </b>started swimming around us. It was the best way I could have imagined to ring in the new year! - Michelle Walker 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:55 - </b>in waning light (after a day of office work) I am watching dorsals of <b>at least a dozen</b> of them spread out west side of <b>mid channel south and north of Baindridge/Seattle ferry lanes</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:45 - </b>seeing whales from<b> pt Edwards in Edmonds</b>. Going south. Boat with them.  - Whitney Neugebauer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:38 - </b>all have passed point no point heading south. They are very spread out taking about an hour to all pass. <b>Onyx came in close</b> and put on a show, breaching right in front of us. The big male that was trailing was Blackberry and he came in pretty close too. Yay Orcas!!!! - Connie Bickerton

And again, at about <b>11:45</b>, when we were SURE they had all passed, I saw <b>a big male fairly close to the Whidbey side</b>. But we both looked for the last 15 - 20 minutes and have not seen another side of him - he must have gone into "Stealth whale" as Mike &amp; Suzanne used to say of Luna. But he's out there somewhere, should be <b>between Mutiny Bay &amp; Foulweather Bluff</b> by now, or maybe a bit south.  
<br/><b>11 am -</b> just as we thought they had all passed by, another group just showed up off <b>south Bush Pt</b>, with another male and several females so far. Saw a neat line up with a breaching whale on one end of it earlier, wonderful whale watching today, most close enough to hear.

A buddy who is a floatplane pilot saw them between Porlier and Sandheads... We picked them up about <b>1.5 miles NW of Active Pass</b>. Got to see <b>J and K pod</b> go south through Active Pass for the first time in 12 years. I have seen L Pod do it a couple of times but have NEVER had J's and K's do it. So awesome and super active when they exited into Swanson. - Simon Pidcock

<br/>
<b>Orca disguised as driftwood</b>. December 29, 2013, I was sitting by the window at Fely's Restaurant at Sportshaven Beach, <b>Brookings-Harbor, Oregon</b> 97415. The ocean there was calm, with swells, maybe around 4 ft., some sets of larger 6 ft. swells. I was watching what seemed to be a driftwood log that always stayed in the part of the wave that rises up high just before it breaks. It was drifting SE in line with the beach. I wondered if that was really driftwood because some of it projecting out of the water seemed to move slightly. It featured something like a knobby thing sticking up a bit in front, a much higher curving backwards fin shape on top, and some funny looking things sticking up a bit in back. It seemed about 8-10 ft. long. It resembled a driftwood piece of tree battered, with broken limbs, black in color. It is not strange to see driftwood that looks like it has a dorsal fin, but when it floated upwards to the peak of a much larger wave, <b>I saw an oblong white thing that shone in the sunlight</b>, resembling the oblong face mask of a snorkeler. It could not be that. And the black shape had some white showing on the underside. I heard seals barking nearby as this is near the mouth of the Chetco River. Drifting along in the place where the waves rise up the highest, another larger wave showed there sure was an oblong white patch shining in front, and some white on its belly, and it adjusted to that wave as it started to break. I thought that is either some funny driftwood, or a predator disguised as driftwood. A woman was walking along the sidewalk, as though she did not see anything different or exciting. I looked at something else, maybe my coffee. I wondered if I should go out to get a closer look. When I looked back, the "driftwood" had completely disappeared, not washed on the beach or anywhere. Then, I saw two seals diving into a wave around the place I had last looked. Today I searched for what orcas look like, and the horizontal oblong white eye patch gave it away. It is most interesting that an orca seemed to be deliberately staying still to resemble driftwood and deliberately drifting along where the waves were highest before breaking in order to observe everything going on along the beach, people, people with dogs, cars, RV's, restaurant, as well as anything going on with seals. The predator disguised as driftwood suddenly disappeared probably in pursuit of the seals. - Donna Goss

<b>3 pm - </b>just got back from <b>Bush pt</b> they are heading N and very spread out. LOL been here for 10 years this is only the third time I have seen them...today, yesterday and about 2 years ago!! - Jim Barrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:25 -</b> Leading edge of the pod must be <b>at about Bush Point </b>by now. There is a small pleasure point on the trailing edge. 
<br/><b>2:05 -</b> mid-channel, still near <b>Mutiny Bay</b>. Heading North towards Windmill Heights and Bush Point. Moving quickly.-  Mike Meyer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>From 2 to 2:30</b> we watched distant orca outlines in the sun as they surfaced, slowly moving northward, with a few foraging diversions and taillobs, <b>spread out for several miles 2-4 miles from the Whidbey side. 
<br/>2:15 pm -</b> after watching the orcas pass by for about 30 minutes, thought they were all by us, then looked up to see more coming! They are traveling very spread out, still <b>heading NW out of Admiralty Inlet</b>. The leaders must be <b>at or close to Bush Pt. by now</b>, with more further back, between N. Mutiny Bay and the entrance to Hood Canal. Beautiful day! 
<br/><b>1:45 pm -</b> it looks like they are <b>heading NW into Admiralty Inlet</b>, between Mutiny Bay (Whidbey Isl) and Skunk Bay (N. Kitsap) now, looks like the little NOAA boat is with them. So far the sun has kept the fog from closing in so we can see them! 
<br/><b>1:30 - </b>First glimpse of blows NE of Point No Point, heading up Admiralty Inlet. - Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Wow, did they give us a present at <b>point no point</b>. Two whales came right up to the shoreline. The research boat is still following them through admiralty inlet! Still heading north. - Dianne Dee Iverson

The newly-attached satellite tag shows clearly on L87 Onyx's dorsal fin. Happy whale watching all! - Sara Hysong-Shimazu 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:55 - </b>Susan Marie Andersson called to say the <b>whales were off Point No Point</b> and seen orcas passing close by land, including<b> J2 Granny</b>.

After waiting for a looong time in <b>West Seattle</b> our persistence paid off. Saw a few scattered from <b>Alki</b> <b>long after sunset</b> in the dimming light.

From <b>4:40 to 4:50 </b>in waning light, we pulled off on South end of <b>Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Isl.</b> and spotted a few further south mid channel when all of a sudden in the stillness I heard the unmistakeable blows of <b>orcas</b>. Ed and I watched an adult male, a female and a calf about 1/2 mile from us forage as they trended southbound. They appeared a little bit sleepy, the calf looking so cute as it completely logged for over 10 seconds. Best end to a rather sparse (for us) sighting day.

At about <b>3:30</b> (when we went back into Shilshole) they were <b>spread out from at least Carkeek Park to south of West Point</b>. They were still moving quite fast, they are just so spread out in small groups that it sounds like they might be going quite slow.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 - </b>It was glass calm on xmas day 2013 as we watched a group of about <b>16 orcas heading southbound near Seattle</b>, about <b>1.5 miles west of Shilshole BayMarina</b>  and 1.5 miles north of West Point/Discovery Park. They were traveling and well dispersed over about 1/2 mile. Several pairs included juveniles. We were in our sailboat motoring (no wind) so we shut down as they passed. We could hear more coming from the north and saw more to the west towards Point Monroe, <b>counting at least 16.</b> We were one of 3 boats in the general area that appeared to have encountered the orcas.

Possible gray whale - Just saw what <b>looked to be (not sure) a small Gray headed towards Belfair off the South Shore of Hood Canal</b>. Am on the beach on the South Shore of Hood Canal. It was swimming towards the end of the Canal near Belfair. It was clearly gray in color, much bigger than a Dahl, too gray for a pilot whale, large flukes, spouting as it slowly porpoised through the water seemingly on a mission. The last time I saw a gray come through here a couple years ago I'm told it got caught in the low tide (as the Canal is only 30-50 feet deep here at mid channel) and died near the Thelar wetlands. I watched for it to come back but didn't see it. It was clearly not a Sea Lion and if a Gray it had to be an immature one traveling alone. - Ginger Miller

Coastal orcas	- R. Kuehn snapped some great shots of 250-300 CA sea lions as they were porpoising away from<b> 7-10 pursuing killer whales at about 1030</b>. The pod included one adult male and were last seen heading north slowly off <b>Sea Ranch, CA (south of Mendocino)</b>. He did not get any photos of the whales however. We then had two follow up reports that were likely the same group of animals: <b>2:05PM Killer whales 1.5 miles north of Sail Rock, 1:30-2:30PM Killer whales off Navigator rocks</b> and south end of Sea Ranch. Sounds like they were working the area pretty good. - Naked Whale Research

Through thick fog and chilly drizzle I stood watching for orca swimming past Bainbridge Island yesterday in the waning light. Orca Network had been posting most of the afternoon that a pod was making its way south in Puget Sound. Around 3 pm, reports brought them close to nearby shores and I finally gave up trying to make headway on my Christmas decorating and grabbed a rain jacket and binocs and headed out. I made it to a favorite lookout spot on the southeast shore of the island within 10 minutes, and within 2 minutes had them in sight. My teeth were chattering, and holding the binoculars still was a bit of a challenge. I promised myself I'd throw on more layers next time I go running for the door after hearing "they're back." I was soon joined by a couple of fellow orca watchers, and while we were rewarded with only a few fleeting glimpses from our roadside perch <b>at Rockaway Beach, the sight of the tall, black dorsal fin</b> breaking the surface of the steely gray waters of Puget Sound never fails to quicken the pulse. Once you see an orca in the wild, you will know that is where these magnificent belong. Forever wild and free. - Susan Marie Andersson

My family and I were at <b>Lime Kiln Point on San Juan Island at 1:30 today</b>. We saw a small pod of <b>maybe 7 orcas</b> that were hanging out briefly and then went booking North - even porpoising out of the water. I believe it they were Transients. Before they took off we saw a spy hop and a tail lob. There was at least 1 bull, maybe 2 and a mother and baby. They were pretty close to shore. Lots of birds flying around - must have been some good food nearby. We got lucky today!!! :) - Coleen Moore

<b>President Point</b> (about 2 miles south of the Kingston ferry dock),<b> 2:30 pm</b> - females had a large sea lion that they were playing with. Seemed to be teaching their younger ones. Sea lion got away and headed for the beach and whales stayed only 20 yards away watching him. Don't know the outcome but probably not in the sea lion's favor, he looked beat up and tired. Lasted about 2 hours. Large male 25 yards off beach showed off his moves for us, doing all kinds of tail slapping, breaching, slow barrel roles and other fun. Always stayed about 100 yards away from the females playing with the sea lion. - Whitney Sackman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

About<b> 3:00 pm, President Point Kingston</b> (about 2 miles south of the Kingston ferry dock), pod of about<b> 8-10 Orcas</b> playing between Mid Channel buoy and Kingston side for about 1 1/2 hours, spy hopping and body splashing. Large male and females with calves. Always so exciting to watch from my home. They finally headed north. - Margaret Steen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Approximately<b> 8-12 orcas were off President's Point </b>for approximately 1 1/2 hours. One observer (a former Alaska fisherman) said they were training their young to hunt. A sea lion was injured or killed as they breached, swam in a circle, and hunted. Approximately <b>4:20 p.m.</b> the orcas swam north toward Whidbey Island. - Pam Wilson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:40 - </b>I'm looking west with binocs from north beach at the shore line south of <b>apple tree cove</b> at a very active group maybe only 100yds off shore.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:27 - </b>Right next to the <b>Kingston ferry </b>drop. Small group with huge male. - Whitney Sackman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:44 -</b> After that last group dive, they came back up waaaaay over on the Kitsap side. Not easy to make out from <b>Shoreline/Edmonds</b> now, impossible without binoculars. Every so often the entire group stops surfacing and disappears under water for up to 2-3 minutes. Wonder what they're up to... Herding/shoaling fish maybe?
<br/><b>1:40 -</b> Seeing some of the most active killer whale behaviors from 2 or 3 of the many animals across from <b>Richmond Beach</b> (Edmonds/Shoreline), approximately mid channel. Been watching full body lunges, porpoising and many other behaviors since around <b>1:15 PM</b>. Just watched an inverted full body breach through binocs! Three other animals were doing sync'd surfacing. Overall group is slowly making their way north. - Dave Haas

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:16 - </b>the group off <b>Rolling Bay</b> is still headed north and trending more toward mid channel now rather than close in to <b>Bainbridge</b>. Only occasional dorsals spotted in the haze.

<br/><b>11:38 -</b> at least 2 dorsal fins in rolling bay very close in on the <b>Bainbridge</b> side. - Lynn Batson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:42 - </b>Sounds like north group is northbound near <b>Rolling Bay</b> and the south group is northbound somewhere near <b>Dash Point</b>, which means likely to head up the east side of vashon. - Amy Carey

Took this just a little bit <b>north of Olympia at Burfoot Park</b>. <b>10-15 transient orcas </b>consisting of adult females, juveniles and an adult male. They were gradually making their way out of Budd Inlet but had just made a kill as seagulls were feeding on scraps and the orcas were being very active with spy hops, back dives, tail and pec slaps. <b>T037</b> may have been of the females but they were too far away to tell for sure. - Melisa Pinnow

<b>11:31 -</b> They are still here and now watching them I think there may be more than 10, there seem to be quite a few.....
<br/><b>11:15 - </b>They were headed south but they have been staying put for about 15 minutes.....

This morning at around <b>10 a.m. </b>a<b> pod of five orcas</b> cruised by in front of our house on <b>Pickering Passage</b>. We are about <b>1.5 miles south of the Harstine Bridge</b>. One was in the lead and the other four were a little way behind. - Christy Rowe

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:10 - </b>Apparently there is a group (<b>10-12</b>) that just passed <b>under the Harstene Island bridge</b>, heading south. That means they're possibly coming into Budd/Eld inlet territory OR Totten Inlet or both.
<br/><b>9:57 -</b> There are <b>at least EIGHT orcas </b>currently heading south in Olympia by <b>Boston Harbor into Budd Inlet</b>. - Kim Merriman

<b>2 pm -</b> At least <b>10-12 orcas</b> were seen for over an hour feeding near <b>Pt. Defiance</b>! One very big bull and a small calf! Three of the males stuck close together, they all worked together to round up fish (or seals) to edge of the shelf where it dramatically drops off, they could pin em up to the wall of the shelf! Absolutely beautiful to watch! Boats were getting too close irritating the whales! We watched the whole hour from where the lighthouse use to be! - Dayna Campbell

Michael Molnar called to report seeing <b>a single, adult male, orca, heading north about 200 yards off the WA coast near the Quilleute River</b>.
<br/>These were taken from the beach in <b>LaPush, Washington</b>. Right after this guy showed up on scene there was a lot of mammal activity in the area. We were swimming our dogs in the surf using a tennis ball, at one point while one of the dogs was about 20 feet out a sea lion popped up 15 feet away and watched him. Soon after that there were several seals around. do you think this was because of<b> the Orca</b>??? - Michael Molnar

<b>11 am -</b> WA State Ferries reports a pod of approx. <b>12 orcas in Haro Strait off Speiden Island</b>, heading north. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

After being alerted by Giles that <b>orcas could be heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>, we went out to find them. Sounded like residents on the hydrophones. At about <b>10:30 am</b> we found them about <b>3 miles offshore of County Park in Haro Strait</b>. The leaders were approaching the Kelp Reefs marker. We saw <b>two groups of at least 6 orcas each</b> surfacing about a mile apart, with an adult male between them, about 1/2 mile from each group. Then both groups disappeared, with only 2 males surfacing together. Next, the 2 males disappeared. It was cold, so we left. There could have been 20 plus orcas. They likely are the orcas spotted by the ferry in Haro near Speiden Island at 11 am. - Sharon Grace

Sunday dawned cold and bright, becoming even brighter when the S<b>outhern Resident orcas passed Point No Point</b> and headed north up Admiralty Inlet past Whidbey Island. Grace and power merged as they broke the surface breaching, tail-slapping and spy-hopping. Some traveled alone, others in pairs or trios, some grouped together in a spectacular display of family unity, dorsals glinting, vapor from their blows backlit by sunlight as they maintained a steady pace cutting through the quiet water. What a treat on a frosty winter's day! - Sandy Pollard

Today, from approximately <b>1400-1445</b>, I watched <b>a pod of 6 or seven orcas traveling quite steadily from near the boat ramp at the Coupeville ferry slip</b>, and later, from near <b>the lighthouse at Ft.

<b>1:30 -</b> I happened to be at the whale view walk (go figure!) <b>south of the aki lighthouse</b> near alki beach in west seattle and <b>at least four orcas</b> passed by there apparently heading towards Vashon Island. I couldn't estimate the number but presumably it was the same pod your reports indicate was in Ballard a few days ago. I didn't have a good zoom lens but took a few pictures that I'm attaching. The time is approximate. I have a couple more photos, although all of the same quality from a distance. - vinay krishnaswamy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 - </b>It was pretty amazing. We were stopped a ways out from the dock waiting for the other ferry to leave and they swam real close. One was only about 50 yards off our stern. It was best view I had of them in long time. <b>9:01 - </b>There is <b>at least 5 orcas right now heading south right in front of Edmonds ferry dock</b>. - Ben Abrahamsen

I went out in the morning to confirm which killer whales were spotted from shore south of Trial Island. I came across the<b> K13's </b>northeast bound <b>south of Oak Bay </b>and could see several more animals to the south but conditions wouldn't allow me to get any other ID's.  Thanks to George and Gord for initially spotting them. - Mark Malleson

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">December 5</font></b></center>
<br/>

On the <b>afternoon</b> of  December 5th I headed out with a group of adventurers after clearing the morning snow off the seats and we followed up a report of killer whales spotted near Speiden Island. We came across  <b>2 groups of Transients in Boundary Pass</b>. Many of them were the same individuals we had on December 2nd along with the<b> T185's </b>traveling  close by. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The snow started falling gently at about 9 am, and with no reports of whale activity and limited visibility Skipper Mark hustled out past the breakwater in the afternoon. He headed north towards <b>Boundary Pass</b>. After just over an hour of searching Mark found <b>a massive group of transient killer whales</b>. Usually these mammal eating whales are in small family groups of 2-5, but sometimes several groups join together. The group Mark found had <b>15, including the T185s, T75Bs. T38s and the T35s</b>. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

I was out <b>swimming at around 2 p.m. off Sunset Dr. (Salt Spring Island, B.C.) when a pod of 5 orcas swam through just off Idol Island</b>. They were headed north through Samsun Narrows! What a great experience! - Maureen Phelan 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>A couple of the transients I saw from the Dec 4th BC Ferry trip. There were 3-4 of them just outside Active Pass and into the strait around 2PM</b>.  - Tim Green

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:25 - two or 3 groups</b> seem to be feeding and resting between mid channel bouy and big round bouy at <b>north end of Shilshole Marina</b>, milling n moving slow. 
<br/><b>4:11 -</b> still moving real slow by <b>Shilshole. 
<br/>3:56 -</b> large group moving slow about few hundred out from <b>Shilshole</b>. - Susan Vennerholm

This sighting today <b>at noon is between Anderson Island and Ketron Island</b>. Friends of ours were bringing their boat back to Anderson Island from Tacoma today around noon and they were <b>surrounded by two pods of Killer Whales</b> that approached their boat on the<b> East Side of Anderson Island</b> in an area that the Washington State Department of Natural Resources has designated as a Dump Site for Dredged materials from the an area in the Port of Olympia. The Dumping of (20) Barge Loads or 20 Million Pounds of dredged materials is scheduled to commence this week in the area the Killer Whales were sighted in today. This is an area where three or more Dall's Porpoises are seen the year round. Killer Whales feed on Squid and other marine life and the squid are abundant in this area. Apparently they came right towards the boats and two pods circled and dove beneath the boats. I understand <b>they counted around (7) Killer Whales</b> including two small ones with their mothers. I'm up-loading the video that will be posted on the Anderson Islanders Facebook site later this evening very slow process.  - Bob Lyden, Anderson Island.

<b>3:38 -</b> I saw the <b>Orcas between Salmon Beach &amp; the point of Point Defiance</b>, milling about for a bit, looked pretty close to shore (I was watching from Gig Harbor). When I was leaving 10 minutes ago, they had reached the point and appeared to be headed towards Vashon. - Heidi Powers Armstrong

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:46 - </b>We see <b>6 (one small one) Orcas just off Salmon Beach, Tacoma</b>. - Kathy Wilson

<b>1:07 - </b>Just left<b> 8 Orcas that seem to be feeding at Point Robinson Vashon.</b> They are still there. One of the Orcas that visited Point Robinson today is <b>K25-Scooter</b> 22 year old male. - Kelly Burns Keenan   

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

 This is<b> J37 Hy'Shqa</b> at <b>Point Robinson</b> today, according to Melisa Pinnow. So we had part of J pod with K pod in Puget Sound today, even if we couldn't see them all while they were spread out in the huge waves whipped by ferociously icy winds! - Meg McDonald

<b>12:06 -</b> just found em. Steaming towards<b> Point Robinson</b>. - Amy Carey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:33 - </b>Maia of WA State Ferries called to relay a report from a ferry of <b>a pod of orcas seen from the north end of Vashon Island</b>, heading south down the east side of Vashon. The number could not be estimated due to wind and waves.  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>At 2:00pm </b>we watched <b>four orcas</b>, including a small one, pass our home on <b>Totten Inlet</b>, moving up the bay slowly from north to south, into the inlet. We followed them with binoculars, lots of rolling and spouting, glistening in bright sunlight against a blue sky. We are guessing residents, because they left feeding debris for a large flock of seagulls to clean up. Spectacular. - Dee Morton 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3 pm - </b>about half way down<b> Totten Inlet </b>(far south Puget Sound), immediately opposite the entrance to Little Skookum Inlet (Mason County). I don't know of any orca sightings this far down Totten Inlet. I have heard of sightings from Steamboat Island, five miles to the north. The water is only about 40 feet deep.  - Anders Price

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:30 - </b>Just saw<b> 3 Orca</b> moving at a high rate of speed, heading north, <b>north of Olympia and South of Hunter Pt.</b>, on the east side of the Inlet. They looked to be female, judging from the size of the fins. Their may have been a juvenile with them. They were zooming along, crashing through the waves. - keller galvin 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:10 - </b>We saw<b> (3) Orcas heading north on the West Side of Budd Inlet</b>. We were on the <b>East Shore @ Burfoot Park</b>. YEAH! Cheers!  - Keith Edgerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Observed <b>4 orca in Budd Inlet</b> this morning at about<b> 11:30</b>, moving north from Priest Point Park toward Olympia Shoal, feeding at they went. One juvenile in the group.  By 11:45 I had lost sight. Using 20x spotting scope. - Mike Woodall

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:44 - </b>They are way into <b>Budd Inlet</b>, on west side toward country club. - Gayle Swigart

<b>10:48 - </b>There are <b>at least 6 orcas</b> (hard to tell to wind and waves) currently<b> in Budd Inlet</b> - still heading south.  
<br/><b>10:40 a.m. - </b>The orcas I reported a few minutes ago are still heading south - <b>past Boston Harbor and into Budd Inlet</b>. Can't get a confirmed head count.....maybe 6. 
<br/><b>10:16 - Whales</b>! <b>South of Dana Passage</b> heading south! Large blows. Fins. Breaching. - Kim Merriman

Saw about <b>10 - 12 orcas swimming east in Boundary Pass</b> today, <b>between Waldron and Saturna Islands</b>. They were swimming in 2 fairly close groups. First group was very close together with a little one swimming between mature orcas. Second group was spread out with breaching and tail slapping. - Maureen Welton

<b>Large group of Transients (8-9) northbound past Turn Point towards Pender Island (15:30pm).</b> - John Boyd

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had <b>two large groups of T's in the afternoon in Haro Strait.</b>  I came across the first group <b>mid strait between Henry and Sidney Island</b> moving quickly northwest. The other group was shadowing them within a couple of miles to the north east. There was also<b> a single humpback whale </b>they passed which I last saw south bound at<b> Kelp Reef</b>. Great way to start December! - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My T's today were <b>T35, 38's, 49's, 75B and C</b>. - Ken Balcomb

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:12 - </b>they were headed south along <b>Anderson island</b>. a big boat went passed and I haven't seen them since. 
<br/><b>3:54 -</b> I'm at <b>chambers bay</b> and can see them breathing in between<b> Anderson island and McNeil</b> - Alex Fazekas-Boone 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Five killer whales  passed Point Robinson on Maury Island today</b>. These fast-moving orcas dove deep as they approached the point, and they didn't resurface until they were about a mile past us - Meg McDonald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

That was so fun! Glad I finally caught up with them, been chasing them all summer &amp; fall! I started at Point Defiance &amp; they were already<b> past Titlow</b> by the time I got there. They were really moving. I went to <b>Sunset Beach Dr</b>. next. Where I finally caught up with them &amp; saw them feed for a bit. They attracted a large group of Gulls &amp; an Eagle to help them eat. This is the only time I actually saw them, not just their breath, today. Got a few good dives &amp; some tail slapping. Then they were <b>off again to McNeil/Anderson</b>. &amp; like Alex I watched them head around the corner towards Longbranch. Maybe they will still be here in the morning! Think I got a shot or 2 with my Telephoto at Chambers. With the Olympics in the background. Ill post if any turn out! - Melissa Bird

<b>1:40 PM - orcas heading south at Salmon Beach, Tacoma Narrows</b>. - Sarah 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:35 - </b>They regrouped and are headed south down <b>Tacoma narrows</b>. They are just north of salmon beach now, very close to shore. I'm watching them from gig harbor side 
<br/><b>1:24 - </b>They're a little more spread out now and seem to be swimming in a circular pattern between <b>Vashon and pt defiance</b>. Tail flips, spy hopping. Glorious! Sorry I'm not close enough to get a pic!  
<br/><br/><b>1:16 - </b>Between <b>pt defiance and Vashon </b>back and forth 
<br/><b>1:15 - </b>now southerly. 
<br/><b>1:14 -</b> Just surfaced. They are northerly in the <b>Vashon ferry lane</b>.

<b>12:38 - </b>Westbound along south end of <b>Maury Is.</b> - Jason Cook

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:50 - </b>could see their blows between mid channel yellow buoy and <b>Pt Defiance ferry</b> heading southwesterly (so west) will be interesting to see which way they turn once they reach Pt Defiance. I go home now. Been a beautiful day. 
<br/><b>Noon update -</b> turned back to more southerly direction, again more towards <b>Dash/Brown's Point</b> as Amy said earlier. 
<br/><b>11:45 -</b> I moved south...they appear to be headed <b>more westerly </b>now with sun shimmering on their backs and dorsals. 
<br/><b>11:30 - </b>they've <b>resumed heading south</b>, about 1/2 mile out. 
<br/><b>11:25 - </b>they dove underwater <b>past Pt Robinson</b> and resurfaced near buoy to south. Alot of surface activity, maybe on a kill? I am watching from bluff above <b>Des Moines marina</b>. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:40 - </b>I can see them with binoculars from Ruston Way in Tacoma just<b> SE of Maury</b>. - Jason Cook

<b>11:33 - </b>Still headed south towards <b>dash point and Brown's point</b>. - Amy Carey

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:27 - KWs just passed Pt. Robinson</b>, unfortunately underwater. Almost certainly transients, have a baby too. A few pix to come but no saddle patches due to angle of approach. 
<br/><b>10:29 - 5 KWs just passed Dilworth</b> on east side of channel. Look like possible transient fins. Still southbound. - Meg McDonald

FYI.... my husband takes the <b>7:55 ferry from BI </b>and just texted that they announced there were <b>Orcas near the boat </b>on his way out... near Rockaway Beach... He said he did not see them but thought i would give you guys a heads up... just in case! - Cindy Russel

The folks on the Bainbridge ferry just caught a glimpse of <b>4 or 5 orcas near the island</b>, on the south side of the boat, offshore between eagle harbor and blakely harbor. It's the 7:55 Seattle to Bainbridge ferry. - Katey Rissi

<b>2:15- 2:30 - </b>We just videoed <b>3 Orcas playing in Skunk Bay between Whidbey Island and Hansville</b>. Normally, they are closer to Whidbey Island, but today in the still waters, they came much closer to the Hansville shore (about 1/2 mile), heading generally south toward Point No Point at 2:30. - Debby Replogle

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:55 - </b>They are just nearing <b>Gold beach on maury island</b>, mid channel in a pretty tight group. Went around the point about 3ish. I left them half way down maury still moving south. It will be a few hours before they would hit the entrance to colvos if they go there. Also not uncommon for them to go all the way there then turn and head back the way they came. - Amy Carey 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:58 - </b>perched on a road <b>south of Three Tree Point/Burien can see pod</b>. Going to be a sweet pass by for all at Pt Robinson. From this vantage pod seems to be bunched up...there are a lot of whales! - Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:56 - </b>Sounds like the <b>orcas are reaching Maury Island</b>, headed south toward Pt Robinson. Will they circle up the west side of Vashon Island, keep going south toward the Tacoma Narrows, or turn around and head back north?  - Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My first time seeing whales today. Saw on Facebook that these guys were on the north east end of vashon so we hopped the ferry from Tacoma over there and stopped at the first park we found. Saw whales way out in the water (barely) and as they swam past us we met some nice folks who told us a better spot to see them down the road. Went over to the other spot and waited, and sure enough <b>they swam less than 50 yards away from us</b>. This s&amp;#% was dope. The video sucks because it's from my phone but man it's rad to know these dudes are in our backyard. - Alex Fazekas-Boone

 Here's another beautiful photo of the S<b>RKWs passing Point Robinson this afternoon</b>! This is a mixed group of youngsters and adults from<b> J and K pods</b>: <b>Suttles J40, Se-Yi-Chn J45, and their mother Samish J14, with Ripple K44 and his mother Deadhead K27, Scoter K25, who was satellite tagged about a year ago. The tag barbs broke off in his dorsal fin and are still stuck there in what appears to be a depressed area of his fin, Skagit K13, his sister Deadhead K27, and Rainshadow K37.</b>. Many thanks to Melisa Pinnow for identifying these orcas!  - Wild Northwest Beauty Photography
