<b>8:00 am</b> Cliffside - 20 whales, Boundary Pass, heading west, no boats.
<br/>Saturna Sightings Network
<br/>*<br/>
A great day with all the Southern residents here milling and partying, whales most active. Lots of breaching and whatever.
<br/>Ron Bates, MMRG 
<br/>Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
J's, K's, L's. Mixing freely and showing off every behavior they are known for. Multiple breaches, great action that seemed to go on forever.
<br/>JB
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
Js and Ks headed for San Juan Is. down Boundary Pass from East Pt., Saturna Island.

<b>9:00 pm</b> Cliffside - K pod, Boundary Pass, going west, no boats.
<br/>Saturna Sightings Network
<br/>*<br/>
The L12's were the only orcas off the west side of San Juan Island. In the afternoon the L12's travelled by Lime Kiln going north. I later watched the L12's travel south back down the island.

<br/><br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b> Cliffside - K pod, Boundary Pass, heading east; <b>3:15 pm</b> East Point - K pod.
<br/>Saturna Sightings Network
<br/>*<br/>
Orcas in active pass an incredible display.
<br/>Wayne Teague
<br/>*<br/>
Patrick from the Bon Accord called to report the L12's off Salmon Bank headed north to Eagle Pt. at <b>4:30 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
K-pod off of S. Pender and Saturna in the afternoon. Lots of Breaching, Cartwheels, and splashing around. Lots of boats too!
<br/>Alison Engle, Naturalist 
<br/>San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
We found them North of Stuart Island just into Canadian waters around <b>3 p.m.</b> - K's.
<br/>Ken Waln - Coupeville.
<br/>*<br/>
About 15 orcas tail slapping and breaching as they passed Pender en route to Active Pass today. It was about <b>3.30 pm</b>.
<br/>David Richard Boyd
<br/><br/>
<b>June 26, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b> Cliffside - J pod, Boundary Pass, heading west, close in shore, much slapping &amp; jumping, moving very slowly.
<br/>Saturna Sightings Network
<br/>*<br/>
A nice day on the water today with L-12's hangin' out on the west side of San Juan Island. A nice pass with L-79 Skana---he's sure starting to sprout!
<br/>JB 
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
The L12's and K's went north up the west side of the island this morning. The K's continued north. The L12's turned back south and spent the day off the west/south side. At around <b>5:00 p.m.</b> the orca magic began. The L12's passed south of Lime Kiln, then suddenly began travelling fast. At the same time reports were coming in that the J's and K's were travelling fairly rapidly down Henry Island. They met the L12's at the southern end of Mosquito Pass. Then the festivities began, with breaching, tail slapping, pec waving, spyhopping, and cartwheeling the norm. This activity kept up to a greater or lesser degree at least as far south as Edwards Point, with feeding going on as well. When a group orcas went kelping off Land Bank, several held salmon in their mouths kind of like toys -- although after a few dives, the salmon disappeared.
<br/>An interesting behavior I observed involved Mega (L41) and Ruffles (J1). Offshore of Edwards Point about 50 to 100 feet apart, each swam with two to three other orcas and appeared to be escorting at least one adult female. I left the orcas as they rounded Edwards Point at about <b>8:00 p.m.</b>

We had the unexpected delight of seeing a youngish gray whale in Penn Cove. We were getting close to Coupeville wharf when it came up very near the boat--15 feet or so a couple of times, blowing and surface diving.
<br/>Rebecca Sundberg, Langley
<br/>*<br/>
We saw whales (we think the pod with 2 new babies) on the S. end of Stuart Is.
<br/>Marcia Bakkom
<br/>*<br/>
The main report was of T14 in the Oak Bay area off Victoria in the afternoon. 
J's and K's going into the ST. of Georgia. 
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria 
<br/>*<br/>
Js and Ks off of Kellet Bluff on Henry Island. Got some good photos of J 38, he is really growing. They really split for the river after that and had the great opportunity to be with T14 on my afternoon trip and at sunset. We were alone with him on the latter part of the sunset and saw two kills. He took one seal right at the surface.
<br/>Tom McMillen, Salish Sea Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We were watching J-Pod and K-Pod up in Active Pass. There were multiple breaches from one of the newest calves, J-38, born just this winter. We also had some close looks at Kiska and her subgroup-Cappuccino and Raggedy.

<b>June 22, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
I went to Point Roberts on U.S.- Canada border to see J and K Pods. They were really forageing and getting their fill. 
As I came through the rip at East Point I just had to stop and watch the action. The Sockeye run is definitely on and everything you can think of was in that rip. Eagles were diving for fish finning on the surface, Seals were everywhere, saw one Steller Sea Lion that must be lost or an old one that just hangs out these days, Sea birds everywhere. Js and Ks have been using Boundary pass lately when they come south and last night was probably no different. The early Sockeye use Rosario Strait for some reason to go to the Fraser so the Whales go down Rosario ( always southbound, as the fish are swimming toward them ) and now as the fish begin to use Haro and Boundary Pass to go north the Orcas come this way southbound. And for some reason for the past four years they go up Swanson Channel more when going north. 
<br/>The L 12s went west and bet they come back with the rest of the Ls in the next day or so right on the heels of a salmon run. The rains of the past few days will make the salmon move toward the river and so does everything else. Pretty cool world we live in.
<br/>Tom McMillen, Salish Sea Charters
<br/>*<br/>
Orcas by Lummi Island southbound (against the flood) at sunset Sunday evening &lt;&gt;8:30 p.m.</div></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html> - way spread out and pretty far offshore, out in the middle of the strait. PROBably J's and K's - big male and a couple sprouters and babies out there.

<br/>*<br/>
J&amp;K Pod were frolicking just west of Point Roberts around <b>3:30 PM</b>. Lots of breaching and K-20 (???) circled our boat 2 times very slowly before joining up with the rest of the group. Very active vocalizations.

<b>June 21, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>10:00 am</b> East Point - 20+ whales	heading west, foggy.
<br/>Saturna Sightings Network
<br/>*<br/>
The Orca Sing was wonderful, the sun came out and so did the whales. J and 
K pod showed up a bit early (<b>7:30 pm</b>), but none of us did mind. It was 
during the sound check that the whales decided to show up. Accompanied with 
Brazilian samba rithms, members of J and K displayed spyhops, breaches, and 
their own beautiful vocals.

<br/>*<br/>
Unidentified orcas, northbound at Kellet Bluff <b>10 p.m.</b> last evening (June 21). 
Looked like a fairly large group. Possibly some southbound. Difficult to 
say from a kayak in lumpy seas past sunset. Probably part or all of the 
group from Limekiln earlier.

Transient T14 off Victoria in the am. L12's south part of Haro St. all day.
Rest of L's still out west. J's and K's came S.W. in Boundary Pass in the afternoon.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
We had the J's &amp; K's in resting mode up near East Point. Nice to see them grouped so tightly. Later in the evening, we had J's, K's &amp; L-12's hamming it up on the west side near Andrews bay. Lots of lunging and breaching.
<br/>JB
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions
<br/>*<br/>
Dave Ellifrit also reported a superpod of J's, K's &amp; some of L's in front of the Center for Whale Research at approx. <b>8:30 pm</b>.

<b>June 18, 2003</b>
<br/><br/>
On Wed 6/18  there was a dolphin swimming along by the <b>8.30 pm</b> ferry from
Mukilteo. Report from Jeff Williams, Langley.
<br/>*<br/>
The big news today is a gray whale in the Samish River, which is actually more like a slough, in Skagit County. The 20' juvenile gray whale has apparently been in the river since early Weds. morning.

<br/>*<br/>
It looks like the Gray Whale left the Samish River last night.

We were with J's and K's earlier today for about two hours. We got as far as Eagle Point at <b>1430</b>, then headed back.
<br/>Vicki Kirkland
<br/>Island Adventures, Anacortes
<br/>*<br/>
Another great superpod day on San Juan Island. At around <b>5:00 p.m</b> J's and K's came down from the north, having passed by the westside going north just over an hour earlier. The L's came from the south (by way of Victoria, according to the whale watch operators.) They met just north of Lime Kiln, then came south. For at least an hour there was lots and lots of breaching, tail lobbing, tail slapping, pec waving, and general frenetic behavior--much of it very close in to shore at Lime Kiln. Many great photo opportunities. A flock of enthusiastic orca fans enjoyed the show.

I live on North Pender Island on the Canadian side of the Salish Sea. A pod of orca whales passed by heading north at approximately <b>7.45 pm</b>. At the
back of the pack was what I assume was a male with a very tall dorsal fin.
<br/>David Boyd, Pender Island BC

J pod as went north off the west side of San Juan Island. At about <b>5:00 p.m</b>. J pod came from the north and L and K pods came from the west and met up just south of Lime Kiln, close in to shore. J pod lined up in a greeting line, but the others didn't. The show was great-- many spyhops, tail slaps, tail lobs, breaches, and lots and lots of rolling around. Even one of the new
calves got on its back and waved its pecs, just like the big guys. They
were still socializing when we left after <b>9:00 p.m</b>.
<br/>Sharon Grace
<br/>*<br/>
Les &amp; Kate Gagnon called in a report of 1 gray whale, <b>4:45 pm</b> heading north off Sunset Beach on the NW side of Whidey Island - first report of a gray we've had since May 25th
<br/>*<br/>
We received a report of a pod of 12 -14 orcas off Cherry Pt.(~ 1/2 mile off the BP dock), heading south at <b>8:30 am</b> this morning. The caller said the biggest bull's dorsal was 4 - 5' tall, with notches in the top back side.

They were travelling North in Swanson Channel, passing Mouat Point, North Pender Island swimming slowly, some tail slapping, some of what appeared to be fishing behavour. I saw 1 baby with two other adults, so am guessing at J pod?
It was nice to see them swimming so leisurely; it looked like about 20-25
whales and they took 20 minutes to pass the house.

On Sunday the fabulous K-pod ladies were porpoising in a perfect, close formation abreast of each other, while the little calf surfaced to a rhythm of her own! (Still working on her buoyancy and breathing) At one point, two juveniles did an identical breach together. So beautiful.

J's and K's down Rosario St. in the <b>AM</b>, up the west side and on to Active Pass in the late afternoon. L12's inbound from Sooke late this afternoon and a (large whale) inbound, first reported as a Gray and now a Humpback?

We received a message from someone who saw 3 adult and 1 juvenile orca on May 31 or June 1 near Coos Bay, actually going up Coos River, 3 miles inland, heading upstream!
<br/>*<br/>
And another call from Joe Schmitt, of 7 orcas - 1 male, 1 calf, and 5 gender unknown, off Whiskey Creek Beach (west of Pt. Angeles, across the strait from Sooke, BC), headed west, close in to shore in 25' of water. (sounds like it could've been Transients?)

Information is that T1 ("Charlie Chin", Transient orca born in 1960) was seen off Ulculet at <b>1340</b> this afternoon (May 6) for the first time in 11 years, going West, waiting for confirmation. (T1's dorsal fin has a big notch out of the top of the fin - keep a lookout for this guy!)

Left Vic. at <b>1000</b> to go west to catch up to Lpod out west of Sooke.
At <b>1023</b> ran into T14 going N.E. accross the Vic. waterfront, stayed with him for a bit. Then on to Race Rocks 9 El. seals 22 Cals. 5 Steller, back to T14 left him at Trial.Is. At 1400 Lpod still reported out west but K's and J's coming South in Rosario St. Had a great meeting with KPod just off Colvile Is.
K21 and K22 are growing boys, great pass by K40. Going and coming we had a minke just W. of Salmon Bank.

Js &amp; Ks...traveling south at north Lummi at <b>12 noon</b> and approaching Bird Rocks when we left them around <b>3:30 pm</b>; and they were very active. We viewed tail lobs, spyhops, "cartwheels", pectoral slaps, and more breaching activity than I have seen so far this season!

We found J and K pods just north of Lummi Island heading south at around <b>noon</b>. They were resting at first and then started waking up a little.  Saw them again after we left Friday Harbor right out in front of Deception Pass.

Here's a quick rundown on the day. All of K pod, including K35, were present.  All groups from L pod were here today too. All sprouters and fall babies (except L102, of course) were present and accounted for. L55 has a new calf!  This calf will probably be L103. L85 is sprouting in a goodly way.  The only two whales not seen by CWR today were L3 (~53 year old female) and L58 (23 year old male).  We had a good look at these two whales matrilines that were all nice and tight and they were not there. We will NOT kill them off yet until we get a few more (or more) encounters. We left L pod heading south with the fleet near Salmon Bank. J and K pods headed north and we left them still heading north off Monarch Head around 1810. It was a very satisfying arrival day!

...Js &amp; Ks in the early part of the day. The pods were close to the San Juan shoreline near Pile Point in a resting pattern traveling north. L-Pod was offshore near Hein Bank in two sub-pods, they too were resting. Yesterday, June 3rd, J-pod showed up at Cypress Island's Tide Pt. at <b>7 pm</b> traveling south; they must have been up north in that rough water all day.

Received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters at <b>9</b> this morning - <i>K's &amp; L's are back</i>, NE bound at Discovery Island (near Victoria)!

<br/>*<br/>
Just talked to Tom McMillen; and then to Candi Emmons and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research who have been out with K &amp; L pods this morning - they report the wonderful news that L55/Nugget, has a new calf! They also spotted K35, one of the other new babes of the season. Things look good with everyone so far, though they still have a few more whales to confirm and identify before they can report on numbers and whether anyone is missing, but the preliminary news is great!

Great news...Ks and Ls are back! It seems there is another calf out there in L-pod :) way-to-go Nugget.

It was a georgeous day out on the water yesterday, made even more beautiful by the presence of K and L pods. It was so much fun to listen to all the chatter on the radio as the other operators compared notes to see which whales had been accounted for. They sounded as excited as we were. We certainly started cheering on our boat when we found all 3 adult males, and the celebration continued as we recognized more and more old friends (and a few new ones!). It was a magical day.

We left J's on the west side were they have been off and on for days
That was at <b>1600</b>, sure there must be later reports.
All of J's look good at least what I have been able to see.
The 2 calves are very active and look well.

J pod just south of Lime Kilm Point at about <b>1:30</b>. They went north around the point.
<br/>Hans Dunshee
<br/>*<br/>
At Lime Kiln Park...a lone J (passed about 60' away from us), followed by what appeared to be Oreo and family. They continued northward. As they frequently do, the J's decided to do a turn-around and head south. Suddenly everywhere we looked were orcas breaching, spy hopping, lunging, and putting on a truly beautiful and magnificent show.
