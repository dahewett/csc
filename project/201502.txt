We received a report from Kerry Jess of<b> 2-3 unidentified orcas</b> traveling southbound 1 mile out from shore, seen from shore just<b> north of Roberts Creek in the Sunshine Coast BC</b>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:50pm -  </b>it's super close to shore (less than 1/4-mile out) and very close to <b>Edmonds</b>.
<br/><b>5:25pm </b>Just saw it viewing south from <b>Picnic Point</b>. -Kristin Kreifels

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:15pm - </b>Thar she blows! Couple new blows mile north of <b>Edmonds</b> ferry and about a mile west of north Edmonds. No direction travel yet. 
<br/><b>1:45pm -</b> Couple blows back up this way. Them must have done a deep dive. Line of sight was between my place and point no point but near our side a lot. Closer in than my initial breaching shots this a.m. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:15 - </b>The Whale Trail reported a <b>juvenile humpback off Coleman Dock</b> (via Ben Evans). I  haven't seen any updates. -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:45 am -</b> Kite surfers report seeing it where we lost sight of it this morning...I haven't seen blows from marina beach. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:15 &amp; 11:20am - </b>Janine Harles and Paul Franklin saw blows sightline transect Sunset Ave to Eglon/Kitsap east of mid channel.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:45 - </b>it started breaching sightline transect <b>Sunset Ave and Possession Pt</b>. Then an egregious act of harassment by small fishing boat...grrr. Called in to NOAA. Blows now to the south a ways.
<br/><b>10:20 - </b>just saw a blow east of mid channel sightline between Sunset Ave and Double Bluff whidbey. Maybe a mile out from <b>north Edmonds</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:18am -</b> It was breaching for over an hour straight!
We were watching it breaching, in <b>between ocean and sunset avenue</b> way over<b> on kitsap side</b>. It suddenly stopped so assuming its diving?
<br/><b>10:06am - </b> Stu is going in to check his pics...has anyone seen it lately? It went on a dive.. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:11am - </b>They moved more south and further out towards <b>Kitsap side</b>. Might be better to see from fishing pier?!!
<br/><b>9:05 am - </b>Might be more than one. Seems like a mom and calf... Alternating breaching.. One looks smaller and gives smaller splash the other Huge splashes!
(<i>I heard back from John Calambokidis at Cascadia Research, and Fred Sharpe with Alaska Whale Foundation - they do not believe it is a calf. One thinks it could possible be the pec fin of the humpback, the other thinks it could possibly be another species or ??? And also that the humpback we are seeing looks pretty small itself and is likely a juvenile too young to have a calf. -SB</i>)
<br/><b>8:15am - </b>Whale Repeated breaching. Looks like a <b>humpback</b> (confirmed).  Mile out from <b>a mile north Edmonds</b>. -Stu Davidson

I keep thinking we have probably used all our luck up but things keep falling into place. By yesterday afternoon we were down to one day's fuel supply for the Zodiac. The whales have been<b> all over the coasts of Washington and Oregon</b> in the past two weeks but they managed to conveniently be <b>in the vicinity of the entrance to Grays Harbor </b>this morning allowing us to go in and quickly refuel. On the way back out we had just crossed the bar when we ran into the whales in the shipping channel, and in particular <b>L94 and the new calf</b>. This allowed us to spend more time with them, get a better look, and get a better photo (see photo of the day) than yesterday. In this photo you can see the fetal folds which indicates that the calf is only a few days old and this photo also seems to sum up the calf's vitality. Heading south, whales <b>foraging off the Long Beach Peninsula</b> this afternoon - 5 prey samples today. -Brad Hanson, lead researcher on the Southern Resident killer whale survey team

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">February 25</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>New L pod calf!!</b> Dr. Brad Hanson gives us this latest news from the orca research cruise as well as an update on location of L pod: We were <b>about 15 miles west of Westport this morning when we resighted the whales and observed a new calf - L94 appears to be the mother.</b> To recap since our previous posting, on 23 February we were off Cape Lookout, Oregon following the whales north. Yesterday, we continued following the whales north past the mouth to the Columbia River. Since L84 was tagged a week ago we have been with all of K pod but only part of L pod. On 23 February Jon Scordino with Makah Fisheries sent us photos taken on 20 February of L25 off Cape Flattery, which indicated another part of L pod was in the general area. This morning, shortly after we launched our Zodiac we observed <b>L41</b>, part of the group that includes <b>L25</b>, indicating that another group of L pod had joined up overnight - this is first time we have documented pods reuniting on the outer coast. Fortunately the whales were very grouped up and within a few minutes we observed the new calf - with its unique orange-ish color on the white areas. The calf looked very energetic. We have five more days on the cruise and look forward to additional observations of the calf and collecting additional prey and fecal samples.

<b>9:34 -</b> from the bluff south of <b>Bush Point</b> could see they had feasted. Lost them for a few then re-sighted the pod now traveling northbound up <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, mid channel. -Howard Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:07 am -</b> Renee Beitzel just texted from the Victoria Clipper, they are on scene with <b>Transient orcas </b>who are feeding on something <b>just south of Bush Point</b> (Whidbey Island) in Admiralty Inlet. "They were being very elusive. We weren't able to stay there long but when we first spotted them they were heading north then stopped to feed. When we left them they were still feeding. Hope someone else was able to get some eyes on them!"

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Transient orca in Admiralty Inlet south of Bush Point</b>, with Foulweather Bluff and Hood Canal in the background. -Renee Beitzel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:45 pm - </b>Just watched a gray whale (possibly a humpback) feeding off <b>Point No Point </b>for about 20 minutes. I left there at about <b>2:45</b>. Seemed to be heading back south. We had seen it come up along the shore from the south, moving pretty fast until it got to the Point.  -Ken Shawcroft

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:24pm -</b> It's gone. Headed west towards <b>Foul weather bluff</b>. 
<br/><b>2:55pm - </b>Huge<b> Grey Whale (possibly a humpback)</b> 20 yards off shore at <b>Point No Point</b>. -Thomas Judd

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Talked to someone on the beach that <b>said it was a humpback</b> - looked just like the one that was here last week. Wish I'd seen it. -Connie Bickerton

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">February 23</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>5:40 - </b>we left after watching the <b>HB</b> with a happy crowd of humans. It was surfacing and fluking and keeping to the same general area.
<br/> <b>5:12 - </b>It is <b>humpback</b> and she/ he is mostly milling and just now fluked.
<br/> <b>4:58 - </b>we just spotted a whale (probably the<b> humpback) from Sunset Ave in Edmonds</b> mid channel between us and Possession Point moving southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

 Just <b>saw it from the Sounder Train</b>! Thanks for posting this! -Caleb Thompson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:00 pm - </b>Same whale <b>(humpback) about half hour before sighting at Sunset</b> .. a bit more when<b> northwest of north Edmonds</b>. -Stu Davidson
<br/><b>3:45pm -</b> He's back (again). Humpback off<b> shore of North Edmonds </b>with southerly direction. Probably about 1.5 miles out from Edmonds.
<br/><b>8:57am - </b>Direction: back and forth south and north...Currently south
And definitely <b>a humpback</b>. White under flukes. Got some shots of repeated deep dives
<br/><b>8:20am - </b>whale blows offshore of north northwest of<b> Edmonds and south of Possession Point</b>. Couple blows then a huge bend over deep dive. Watching for a resurface to get possible direction. Likely the humpback. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Saw this guy today around <b>2 pm</b> right around the<b> Tacoma Narrows Bridge</b>!! -Laurie Littlefield-Wells
<br/><i>This appears to be<b> a humpback</b> from the tall shape of the blow. Gray whale blows are more V-shaped</i>.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>7:45 AM - Saw gray or humpback</b> whale this morning about <b>7:45 </b>off Sunset Beach, just south of the <b>Tacoma Narrows Bridge in University Place</b>. Spouts and several dives and resurfaces. Heading north. My son said there were white spots on the skin and I thought I saw a distinctive small fin close to the large tail, but hard to tell which whale it was. Definitely not an orca. -Brian Nathanson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

not sure what this guys is? swam right under our boat. Right off of<b> Point Defiance by the Ferry terminal today at about 3pm</b>. -Laurie Littlefield-Wells

Here's the latest news from our orca cruise and the latest satellite track of tagged whale <b>L84</b>, courtesy of Dr. Brad Hanson from the NOAA Ship Bell M. Shimada. February 23 - As of Friday afternoon <b>(the 20th)</b> we were with the whales heading south off <b>Cape Lookout</b>. The whales continued south on the 21st and at about <b>1600</b> that day, near the mouth of the <b>Umpqua River</b>, in<b> central Oregon they abruptly turned north</b>. They continued <b>north on the 22nd</b>, sometimes up to 10 miles offshore. We observed alot of surface active behavior thoroughout the day - lots of spy hops - and at one point we observed numerous whales repeatedly breaching over a several minute period. Like the previous couple of days, we have observed no apparent foraging and with the exception of a several hour period shortly after the breach fest episode<b> they have remained quiet</b>. This morning we are back off<b> Cape Lookout </b>and they are slowing continuing north.

A glorious sunny day with fellow Orcaholics watching<b> transient orcas passing Whidbey Island</b> under snow-capped Mt. Baker -Sandra Pollard
<br/><i>Identified by Melisa Pinnow as the <b>T046</b> family.</i>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

ID'd as the <b>T046s</b>, the first report had this pod of 5 mammal eating type orcas on the south side of the <b>Clinton ferry dock on Whidbey Island</b>. They had killed something and fed in that location for an hour feet from the dock, briefly interrupting ferry travel and leaving many in awe. The pod then headed north at a fairly swift clip, stalling at <b>Sandy Point</b> where they made a second kill and stuck to this location for another hour. They then proceeded northwesterly into Saratoga Passage where 4 grouped up with one adult male trailing about 1/2 mile behind. We watched with a large happy crowd of people in Langley and followed them along as they kept a steady pace up the Passage. Eventually the trailing male caught up and tucked in with his family as they passed us veering towards <b>Camano Island State Park</b> still northbound direction.
Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:13 - </b>Watched them for almost an hour right in front of our house (just south of the <b>Clinton dock</b>). There were <b>at least four</b> and definitely a baby or very young one with them.

There have been <b>two sightings of killer whales near Neah Bay</b> recently. The first was reported by fishermen to me of a small group <b>(5-10) killer whales on Jan 30 at 9:50 am at Koitlah Point</b> (48 23.19 N, 124 36.02 W). The second sighting was by me on the <b>20th</b>. I observed a group of<b> 5 killer whales offshore Wa'atch Point</b> (48 20.07N, 124 44.44W) at 4 pm.  Attached are the best identification photos I collected. The group was a bit spread out and the lighting made it difficult to get good identification photographs. -Jonathan Scordino, Marine Mammal Biologist, Makah Fisheries Management

<b>K and L pods</b> under observation as they travel south in ocean.

More news from the orca cruise and location of tagged <b>L84</b>: The last map up through February 18 showed the whales just <b>south of Grays Harbor</b>. They continued south until early morning on the 19th when they <b>reached the Columbia River</b>. They remained tightly grouped in that same general vicinity all day on the 19th with no apparent foraging - no fish chases, calls, or echolocation clicks all day. They had been trending north in the afternoon and evening but the early morning satellite tag location revealed they had reversed direction an started traveling south. By this afternoon we caught up with them just south of <b>Cape Lookout, Oregon</b>. Map courtesy of Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

As mentioned in our February 17 entry, we were able to intercept <b>Ks and Ls at the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> and deploy a tag on <b>L84</b>. You may recall that our SRKW satellite tagging project began in 2012 with the tagging of J26. In addition, we now have data from a second J pod member (L87 who travels with J pod) in January 2014 and most recently, the 6 week deployment in January and February 2015 on J27. Collectively, these data indicate only limited use of the outer coastal waters by J pod. In 2014 NMFS was petitioned to designate Critical Habitat on the outer coastal waters of Washington, Oregon, and California. The data used for this petition was derived from only one sample - the range of K25 during the January to March 2013 satellite tag deployment. Consequently, potential variability between pods and between years has led to making tagging a whale from L pod a high priority. 
<br/>
By being able to deploy a tag on L pod while on our cruise on the Bell M. Shimada we have the unique opportunity to now to be able to follow the whales each day (and potentially at night) and collect prey and fecal samples as well as other data about their environment this time of the year. While we know that K and L pods sometimes co-occur in the winter, this will potentially be an opportunity to see the degree to which they remain together. We are off to an exciting start - four prey samples yesterday and four fecal samples today while the whales transited from near Cape Ozette yesterday morning to near Willipa Bay this afternoon.

On Sunday weather cooperated for small boat operations and despite whales again being extremely spread out in the <b>northern St. of Georgia</b>, we were finally able to get a look the newest calf <b>J51 and mother J19</b>. We also documented that as of <b>1600 the tag on J27 had detached</b>, despite having gotten an Argos location as recently as 1200, so this was a fascinating opportunity to see progression tag detachment over the last couple of days. I will send a final map soon.
Because there had been a sighting of Ks and Ls off Sooke on Sat. afternoon we headed down to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and were very fortunate to intercept Ks and Ls about 1600 yesterday (2/16) at the west entrance - we managed to stay with them sporadically through the night tracking acoustically.
We were able to do small boat ops today and <b>deploy a tag on L84</b>. We had great weather conditions all afternoon and were able to collect 3 scale samples and two biopsy samples - however, no one seems to be pooping. We are continuing south with Ks and Ls - we are about half way between LaPush and Westport. -Candace Emmons, NOAA NWFSC.

My neighbors here in <b>Irish Beach (50 miles north of San Francisco CA)</b> were walking on the beach a few mornings ago. They were down on the beach not on a bluff.

Final update - On afternoon of 13 February <b>J pod was at the north end of Texada Island</b>. They spent the 14th moving around in the <b>northern Strait of Georgia</b>. That evening they headed down <b>Malaspina Strait</b> and then headed north between <b>Texada Island and Vancouver Island</b> on the morning of the 15th. The last Argos location we received was at 1100 that morning and we later saw J27 without the tag, completing over 6 weeks of movement monitoring of J pod in the winter. This beats the average duration of tag attachment (30 days). Map courtesy of Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

After hearing about the whales near Lopez Island from the Washington State Ferry report, several of us heading out on the Western Explorer to look for them. We intercepted them in<b> San Juan Channel right outside of Friday Harbor around 12</b>. They were <b>spread out in 3-4 groups heading north</b>. From oil slicks in the water it was clear they made several kills. When all the groups converged near Jones Island, there was a lot of surface activity and they killed at least one harbor porpoise.

First reported to Orca Network by Maia of WA State Ferries at 11:45am traveling southbound near the south end of Bainbridge Island, we caught up with <b>T087, the T90's &amp; 3 (yet to be ID'd) individuals </b>further south at <b>Dilworth on Vashon Island at 2:45pm</b>. Shortly before, a friend witnessed the pod take an animal and as the video begins you'll see how very relaxed they appear. Nearly two hours later (approx. 4:40pm) they approached and <b>rounded Point Robinson</b> much to the happiness of a very patient, large and happy bunch of humans (and doggies). As they were passing the pod (s) grouped up tight just before going under for long dive, surfacing approximately 4-5 minutes later south of the point. We just had us another beautiful and exhilarating winter's day here in the PNW! -Alisa Lemire Brooks

I saw my first Transient kill today. When I met these T's, I was greeted by <b>T087</b> breeching on top of what I thought was a harbor seal. He then proceeded to either drag or chase it out to the deeper water to where the rest of the pod was waiting. They tail slapped, rolled around, and looked as though they were laying on top of something. There was more rolling and tail slaps. There was a lot of movement in different directions and a couple spy hops. Then a ton of gulls surrounded the whales. I speculated that they killed something. This was a pic of one of the spy hops where the orca shows off it's kill. <b>T090</b> has a left over SAT tag in the dorsal fin. <b>Point Robinson, Vashon Island</b>. -Kelly Burns Keenan

<b>One Humpback whale</b> traveling south, <b>West side of Whidbey between Lagoon and Bush Points at 1 PM</b>, breaching.

It was very close to shore, not much more than a hundred feet. -Deborah Heg

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:15 AM -</b> We sighted <b>approximately 7 whales together at Secret Cove on the Sunshine Coast</b> (east side of Strait of Georgia).

2 February update - Based on the trajectory of travel on the afternoon of the 29th J pod was expected to show up in Puget Sound on Friday the 30th. Although they never arrived (but K pod did), by that evening when J27s tag turned back on we observed that they had returned to the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. They spent the next day again meandering around the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Last night (1 February) and this morning's locations continue to show the whales remaining that same general area. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
