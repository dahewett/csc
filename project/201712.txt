December 31- Haro Strait - Surprise! Yesterday's encounter with the<b> T75s (including two new calves)</b> wasn't our last orca sighting of 2017 after all! This afternoon the <b>T18s turned up in Haro Strait. Here's T19B Galiano</b>, a huge male impressive from any distance, as seen from San Juan County Park.

Final trip of the season was a blast! It was freezing, but the sun was out and we had a lot of enthusiastic passengers aboard!! We traveled up to San Juan Island where we caught up with the <b>T18's and 19's</b>, a transient matriline that I have not seen since earlier this season! Always a pleasure spending time with this family that we so rarely ever see. Was nice to close the season out with them.  <b>T19B </b>has a fresh/new notch and rake marks. These are some of my faves from today!

December 30 - San Juans - On the 30th: After hearing from a friend about <b>orcas seen heading north in San Juan Channel</b>, I went to scan from <b>Reuben Tarte County Park and spotted them along the San Juan Island shoreline</b>. They appeared to make a kill south of O'Neal island before continuing north past Reuben Tarte and west through Spieden Channel. It was <b>a group of the T75s: T75B with T75B2 and apparent new calf T75B3, and T75C with apparent new calf T75C1, for a total of five whales</b>....
<br/>2017 has been, from start to finish, the year of the transients. There have been more than double the number of sightings of marine mammal eating killer whales in the Salish Sea this year compared to last year, and their occurrences were already trending up. As the year ends, we look forward to beginning to summarize what we documented this year compared to other years. It's thus appropriate we had the chance to see this group of Ts (T75s) today in San Juan Channel, likely our last orca sightings of 2017! -Monika Wieland Shields

December 30 - San Juans - (Probably the <b>T49As</b> relayed to and by Monika Wieland Shields who did see them herself). <b>4 orcas</b> were observed foraging and feeding about 200 yards off of the east side of <b>Reef Island just outside of Deer Harbor</b>. We hopped in a kayak to take a closer look, and the air smelled heavily of fish and there were scraps of food all over the water near the whales, which the seagulls were feasting on. The whales then moved west into the San Juan Channel towards Jones Island. There was <b>1 male, 2 females, and 1 baby</b>. The picture shows a female surfacing just north of Reef Island...(see below) We saw them first at 3pm and watched them head into SJ channel around <b>330pm</b>. I'm curious as to what they were eating, as it didn't appear as if they were eating any big mammals like seals but from our kayak it was clear that they were feeding because of all of the food scraps all over the surface.  
Once we returned to our beach on the southern tip of spring point after the whales were into the channel, we noticed that a seal was hanging out in 3 feet of water like it was hiding from the whales, a place I have never seen a seal before. -Jack Albright

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:45 p.m. -</b> WSF reports <b>3 orcas between Shaw and Orcas</b>.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Coastal killer whales - December 30 - Oregon coast - Then another call came in from another observer (Brita Clothier) who upped the <b>estimate to 20-25</b>, and who took a video which she will share and we'll share it here if possible. 
<br/><i>Update: Thanks to the video (below) from Brita Clothier, we were able to share with Melisa Pinnow, CWR, and she thinks they are Residents, <b>possibly some of L pod </b>(this is from a distant video, so not a firm ID - but given the numbers of orcas very likely to be Residents -SB</i>) 
<br/><b>Tillamook, Oregon. Possibly Southern Residents</b>. -Video by Brita Clothier, December 30th, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:56 a.m. -</b> Coastal sighting report from Jim Border at the tip of Cape Lookout in <b>Tillamook OR, who saw 15-20 orcas</b> a couple of hundred yards from shore, spread out in 2s and 3s, all traveling steadily northward. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Received a call from Jim Berry about a sighting, 12/30, about <b>11:30AM, from Ecola State Park, at Tillamook Head, of a single orca, 3-5 miles from shore</b>, heading south.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Unidentified killer whales - January 3 - Saratoga Passage - <b>9:30 and 10 am - Orca sighting Saratoga Passage south of Cama Beach</b>
Saw two orca traveling north through Saratoga Passage around 9:30 this morning, then I think the same two came back south around 10:00 AM, -Liz Leffler

December 29 - Haro Strait- hydrophones - <b>9:00 a.m. - </b>I commented the other day that it seemed the whales liked to vocalize at about 9pm.... well, they changed that up...now 9a.m. 12-29-17 - Ts just began - <b>intermittent over OS</b>...at the moment LK is not streaming.
<br/><b>5:37 a.m. - </b>Another day, another acoustic encounter with <b>Ts</b>! - right now 12-29-17 05:37. over <b>OS and LK.</b> -Jeanne Hyde

December 28 - Juan de Fuca - From Eagle Wing WW FB: We were <b>approaching Victoria this evening, after an amazing encounter with the T49As</b> - who were predating on a harbor seal - when we stumbled upon <b>15 or more killer whales (T36As, T36Bs, T137s and likely another group)</b>! Interestingly, <b>two of these matrilines were sighted in Mendocino last week</b>. On this day, they were in pursuit of a large male Steller sea lion seeking refuge near the boat. The hunt continued for close to half an hour, before we slowly motored away and watched as the killer whales closed in on the exposed sea lion. A fascinating display of power! In compliance with whale watching guidelines. -Brendon Bissonette, Eagle Wing Naturalist

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Spotted a group of <b>orcas</b> from the bow of the M V Coho while traveling towards Port Angeles around <b>4:45 pm</b>. They were moving northwest and I would guess there were at least 6 in the group, though I am not a trained observer. I had binoculars and could see them quite clearly. We were much closer to Vancouver Island than Port Angeles. There was a whale watching boat in the vicinity. One leaped vertically out of the water, others were rolling, slapping tails onto the water. No camera available. Many other people saw them. -Ruth Brede

December 28 - Haro Strait  - hydrophones - Those calls from last night continued into today 12-28 and expanded from <b>OS to LK hydrophones</b> in the middle of the night..Also there were a couple additional calls added.. .I think they are Ts. Whoever they are they seem to like to chat at 9 in the evening! - Jeanne Hyde

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 27 - Haro Strait - hydrophones - starting at <b>21:24</b> very faint calls are on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b>. This is the second night in a row that these same type calls have been on OS in the last two nights. They were also there on 12 -24. They have been there for extended time periods but not a single clear SRKW call made on any of the occasions. -Jeanne Hyde

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 27 - Saratoga Passage - (supplemental on <b>T46s</b> who were included in last report - ALB). They were pretty elusive today and kept their distance. <b>46D</b> was by himself near Fox Spit then switched sides right before we left. The others were together until mom split and <b>T46E and F</b> were traveling together. -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 27 - Admiralty Inlet - Yesterday <b>afternoon</b> (12/27) I saw what I believe were <b>2-3 orcas off Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island heading north. Can anyone confirm? (we had no other reports but K13s and Bigg's have been coming and going sometimes unnoticed). -Sylvia Kantor

Unidentified whales - Observed <b>a single whale around 11am in the Saratoga Passage</b> today, it was heading north. Was not very large but definitely a whale. Dorsal fin was rather small and situated towards the back of its body. Had flocks of birds near it. Thinking Minke whale? -Boris Pavlovic 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:53 a.m. - Just saw a single small whale heading north off of our beach (4 miles north of Greenbank)</b> heading north. Couldn't determine what it was, but we watched it for a few minutes before we lost it. It was black &amp; at least one dorsal was visible...it was moving fast. -Marie Gill 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Porpoise - December 26 - <b>2:15 p.m. - Fairly certain there is a large pod of porpoise coming into Penn Cove</b> now. -Kelley Neal Myers 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We saw a <b>group of porpoise at the mouth of Penn Cove around 1:00</b> and they hung around for about an hour. It appears there was a large amount of fish in the water due to birds and seals hanging around also. -Kristi Miller Brown

<b>2:13 p.m. - Out from Presidents Point, Kingston </b>still meandering southbound as they forage for food.  
<br/><b>1:38 p.m. - Orcas are very spread out</b>. So far just seeing <b>K13s</b> engaging in a lot of fishing! Circling, zig zagging, lunging as they go after salmon. <b>K25 and few others, including K27 and son K44</b> were mostly more towards mid channel with K34 closer to Kitsap. K25 would cruise westward, then head back towards west of mid channel. K25 partaking in much lunging! 
<br/>On one occasion one of the younger whales was after a fish and K25 came hauling from the east, and lunged after the salmon, then headed back off towards mid channel again. All this going on while trending very slowly southbound out off Edmonds/Kingston, all keeping to west side of the Sound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Members of <b>K pod</b> trending southbound very spread out chasing salmon off <b>Kingston/Edmonds</b> area on this gorgeous frigid winter day. Matriarch K13 died earlier this year so it was especially meaningful to spend time with the K13s surrounded by the snow-capped Cascade and Olympic Mountains. Only individuals we could confirm were from the K13s: <b>K25 Scoter</b> was partaking in a lot of chasing and lunging today along with <b>K38 Comet and his mom K20 Spock</b>.  Little <b>K44 Ripple</b> (born 2011, not so little anymore) and his mom<b> K27 Deadhead</b> swimming and foraging together.

Sighting on Whidbey Island in Coupeville <b>next to Port Townsend ferry around 4pm</b> today by Lauren Forgas. Two videos by Lauren shared to and by Q13 showing <b>at least 5 orcas (including 2 bulls, female (s) and young)</b> just feet from shore on the north side of ferry and boat launch, just north of the Keystone spit.   
<br/><i>IDs from THIS VIDEO: "The males look like T75A and T77B. It was probably the T75s and T77s traveling together", -Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research</i>. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 21 - Admiralty Inlet - <b>4:12 pm - Five orcas including one bull, heading slowly south down Admiralty Inlet past Bush Point</b> Lighthouse. Called in by Anna Sindayo (sp?) and Pip Gordon, with a Happy Solstice! 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 21- Admiralty Inlet - I assumed there would be a lot of reports since there were a few people out there watching. I happened to stop at the<b> Keystone boat launch</b> on December 21 and noticed a disturbance in the water about 50 yards offshore and soon noticed there were<b> orcas, two large males, four (?) females and a couple of little guys.</b> As they moved closer to shore, about 20 yards, I noticed one of the males was pushing a <b>rather larger pinniped</b> which was wrapped around his nose. The pod was taking turns playing with (beating the crap out of) the pinniped which occasionally rose to the surface for a breath but was soon dragged down. After a half hour or so of this behavior the pod slowly moved offshore and a very tired subadult male Stellers Sea Lion about 2-3 meters long swam slowly to shore but upon noticing me and two others watching, swam back out and parallel to the beach to the east. The sea lion did not have any apparent wounds and was able to swim slowly. The orca pod continued to travel slowly into Admiralty Inlet. They made no further attempt to encounter the sea lion. I have three thirty second iPhone videos which I will share if you want them. Unfortunately, I don't think they show the sea lion. -Happy new year! Dave Parent

Coastal killer whales - <b>T137s and T36Bs in Mendocino CA</b>! -December 18 - CA coast - T137s &amp; T36Bs - Mike Kitahara captured this VIDEO on December 18th of two families of Bigg's/Transients hunting a harbor seal in Mendocino, California.  From multiple videos and still images, Alisa Schulman-Janiger, California Killer Whale Project, recognized the T137s &amp; thought the T36Bs (T36B1 was later confirmed by Jared Towers, DFO ). These two matrilines are "exotics" to that area since they are usually seen through out the Salish Sea and WA &amp; BC coasts! Alisa say they have no prior known documented sightings of them down there. 
<br/>
Video narrative: " What caught my attention was an orca leaping VERTICALLY over a complete body length completely out of the water. This was followed by a smaller flying object, which I soon discovered, was a harbor seal. The seal had probably been tossed around by the whales. I went closer to investigate and noticed the seal on the surface, apparently stunned. It swam over to my boat and tried several times to climb aboard while the group of orcas circled around it." -Mike Kitahara 
<br/>
<b>5-5:30 p.m - 7 or so orca (1 big male, 3-5 other adults, 2 young) Big River- Bay - just south of Mendocino Headlands</b>, apparently celebrating a kill. They were in the Bay breaching and tail slapping. Blood seen in the water by someone viewing from the north. Seals and sea lions frequent the area. I last saw the group headed north past  Mendo Headlands at 5:30. -Sarah Grimes

Resident orcas at sunset backdropped by Kitsap Peninsula. I was standing at Scatchet Head beach at the end of Driftwood Lane looking over towards maybe Eglon, Kitsap.

<b>Kingston Orca Sightings </b>12-11-2017...feeding, with some surface activity. We observed <b>multiple orcas (10-12)</b> while blackmouth fishing <b>between 11 and 3pm. </b>We first observed a large male surfacing <b>near Apple Tree Point</b>, then a few smaller whales nearby. All were headed south toward Jefferson Head, into the tide and wind. Around 1pm, we noticed significant surface whale activity a mile or two from our boat, with the activity just south of the Edmonds/Kingston Ferry Lane, and about two miles east of Kingston. This appeared to be <b>about 8-10 whales </b>all splashing around at the same time, but the 10 knot south wind and waves made observation difficult, and we couldn't see much other than the splashing. While we estimate there were approximately 10-12 whales in the area, most were in smaller groups except for the midchannel group splashing activity. We presume the whales were feeding on the numerous small hatchery chinook salmon around 80 feet down. -Randy Heath

<b>1:32 p.m. -</b> Marilyn Armbruster and I took 1:15 ferry and got surrounded by orcas midchannel and west. Literally everywhere. Still NW bound, spread out, north of ferry lanes. I headed to <b>Bush Pt</b> to catch a glimpse of the residents as they headed north and met up with Marilyn. Since they were on the other side, we decided to hop the <b>ferry (Keystone to Port Townsend)</b>  to try to catch them. Our timing couldn't have been better as the <b>ferry was surrounded by whales everywhere. L92 Crewser</b> cruising upper Admiralty Inlet w/ other members of L and K pods. This is why I live here, the whales, and people still think I'm kidding. I'm not. Thankful for other orca dorks who just get it. -Rachel Haight

<b>1:52 p.m. -</b> I am seeing whales heading south. Some are right off of. <b>Robinson</b> And they stretch all the way across the channel towards what I would guess would be Dash point or saltwater state park? There is a research boat out there. They seem to be meandering in an easterly direction.
<br/><b>1:48 p.m. -</b> I am seeing another group right off <b>Point Robinson</b>. Maybe half a dozen?
<br/><b>1:41 p.m. -</b> I also just spotted a male heading south, but farther behind the first group so it looks to me as if there are two groups? I am viewing this from Normandy Park 219th  St., on the bluff at the end of the road.
<br/><b>1:39 p.m. -</b> So, I think I'm seeing maybe around five? It's hard to tell maybe one male? It appears that there might be a research boat out there with him right in the midst of it all they are spread out between the Point Robinson marker and the yellow channel marker off of Des Moines's area. They are kind of just milling around, but maybe with a more easterly direction.
<br/><b>1:26 p.m. - </b>I am watching them from <b>Des Moines</b>. It looks to me as if they have turned around and are heading in a north direction, but maybe more towards the Des Moines's marina area. -Tanya Esparza

Haro Strait - Well, folks. I don't know what else to say but... <b>J Pod is being faintly heard over the Lime Kiln hydrophones - now! 4:47pm</b> 12-4-17 Now they might not get much louder, or maybe they will. But they are in the area and that is oh, so, dear to my heart! -Jeanne Hyde

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:32 p.m. - Definitely orcas. I think i've heard J pod calls</b>, but they are not close so it's hard to tell. Whoever, they are quite talkative...this was a great night for J and I think L pod calls in Haro...After all the boats (2 bulk carriers and 6 Canadian Military ships) had passed, I could still hear our pod(s) in the distance...so I hope that good eats was the reason they stuck around. -EJ Evans

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:06 p.m. - Picking up calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. Infrequent &amp; far away. -Julie Kimberlin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

December 4 - Then around <b>6:45 I switched to the Orcasound</b> Lab Hydro and heard something that sounded much more <b>like the humpback</b> from the other night...some squeaks, but A LOT of "grumbling" and "burping" mixed with it, a tail or fin slap and even something that sounded like someone blowing on a microphone... Very cool, can't wait to hear who/what I was listening to. -EJ Evans

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:35 p.m. - There is a Humpback making really interesting vocals on the orcasound hydrophone</b> right now! Plus <b>intermittent Jpod vocals on Lime Kiln</b>! -Traci Walter

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

6:16 p.m. - Now there is an <b>HB on Lime Kiln and something on OS.</b>..!!! Wild times on the HPs tonight! adding: on LK HPs it sounded like trumpeting sounds and on OS some of those squeaks an HB makes. of course it lasted only seconds. The HB is on OS and still going on and on. Today there was a young HB between OS and LK Hps from morning, when Ken Balcomb saw it and this afternoon when it came down to the lighthouse and then turned and went back up. Don't know it that's the one who is making all that noise. -Jeanne Hyde

Southern Residents - <b>4:35 p.m.</b> - Marilyn Armbruster and I watched<b> 5-6 heading north between Maxwelton and Point No Point</b> in the almost dark. (Looking at some video I shot - 2 male and 3 female/young. Not sure if there were more. It was pretty dark by the time they got that far...Yes, NW out of Admiralty. We watched them north of PNP, passing Maxwelton, but it was too dark too see them before they got as far as the west end of Useless Bay.) -Connie Bickerton

<br/><b>3:27 p.m. - The Orcas are by Pilot Point</b>, about 2/3 of the way north between Kingston and Point No Point. There is a small green hulled boat that has been following them, that has a standup seat in the bow. They are still slowly heading north, but it appears that the group has shrunk dramatically, so I'm not sure where the bulk of them went. The green hulled boat meandered around a little like they had lost them, until 4 cropped back up now still proceeding north, still on the west side of the channel, heading north. (Research boat is on scene - ALB) -Steve Marczewski
