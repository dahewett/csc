<br/>
<b>4:40 pm -</b> losing light, but thankfully they are now VERY<b> close to the Whidbey side</b>, we could barely see them over neighbor's fence - still traveling north,<b> 1 mile south of Bush Pt</b>, may get to Bush Pt. while there is almost some light to see them...I saw a tight group of 2 males and 3 - 4 others while Howie saw fins of 1 or 2 more further behind. 
<br/><b>4:25 p.m. - </b>yay - the fog and rain cleared enough to have a little visibility, and I just saw two splashes (one was breach-sized) and one male fin,<b> 1 mile south of Bush Point</b>, heading west out Admiralty Inlet - passing the entrance to Hood Canal, closer to the Whidbey side. 
<br/><b>3:10 p.m. - we just spotted at least 2 male fins</b>, looking like they are <b>heading N straight toward Double Bluff or Useless Bay</b> (watching from S. of Bush Pt, they are NE of the green channel marker, closer to the Whidbey side and heading closer to Whidbey). If they turn further E they will be out of our sight, if they head out Admiralty we should be able to see them better soon depending on visibility....(4:10 p.m. notes: Visibility here has diminished, can barely see Admiralty, and can't see Mutiny Bay. From my earlier sighting it appeared they were heading straight toward the Whidbey shoreline near Double Bluff, but not sure if they they turned toward south Whidbey/Possession Sound or west toward Mutiny Bay/Bush Pt. Will try to spot them again and hope this squall passes before dark!) -Susan Berta, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Just home after watching orcas northbound mid channel directly <b>east of Pt No Pt. At least 1 male w/ female plus 1</b>, and a single orca that passed within 400 yards of the point heading north. Very poor visibility - they came with the storm...yes, they should be heading into Admiralty I watched them from <b>2:10-2:25 pm </b>all northbound hard to be sure as they disappeared into the mist but course seemed to be towards south Whidbey. They were spread across and N to S. I saw them from just east of Eglon almost to Possession Point. -Donna Green Van Renselaar 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:38 p.m. -</b> Just <b>south of Eglon</b> boat ramp in northbound shipping lane. (heading directionally towards Admiralty) -Rebecca French Gerke 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:30 p.m. - Apple Tree Pt Kingston -</b> Northbound at steady pace. Multiple breaches, male +? -Sara Frey 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b>11:24 a.m. - seeing one adult male </b>(dorsal shape is like K33's or L92's) mid channel north of yellow mid channel buoy off north <b>Richmond Beach/Presidents Point</b> in southbound direction maybe foraging. I arrived at Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Richmond Beach and so did rain squall. Visibility getting worse. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:15 a.m. -</b> Just saw one that appears to be heading south again. Off <b>President PT, kitsap side</b>, 
<br/><b>11:00 a.m. -</b> Trending north, spread out more mid channel. Some splashing. Heading <b>toward Kingston</b>. 
<br/><b>10:53 a.m.- at least 8 on west side of sound by President Point </b>(south of Kingston). looks like they may be feeding. milling about, slapping tails, trending north. -Joanne Graves 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:50 a.m. - 4 orcas at the green channel marker off West point in Seattle</b>. Getting info from my father in law Capt. Paul on My Girl. -Amber Stanfill 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:45 a.m. -</b> Jeff Hogan sees <b>4-5 </b>roughly mid-channel, crossing the Bainbridge to Seattle ferry lane, heading north. (12:35 - Jeff Hogan reviewed his photos from an hour ago and found the male<b> had an open saddle, meaning Residents. He saw 4 or 5</b>) 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:40 a.m -</b> We just spotted three of them on the <b>Bainbridge to Seattle 10:25 run</b>. Exciting! We saw them at about 10:40 so I'd say halfway across. T hey were close to the ferry and headed west. -Carrie Corns 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:20 a.m. -</b> Megan Hale reported seeing orcas from the <b>Bainbridge Island To Seattle ferry</b>. They are in the middle of the Sound, meandering around the ferry but headed south. -Relayed by Susan Marie Andersson

Only orca photo I got today, of <b>K26 Lobo. K Pod was northbound past Point No Point this afternoon</b>. I was grateful to catch them between squalls. -Photo by Connie Bickerton, November 22, 2017 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wild, wet, windy Whidbey with boiling seas and flying spray - that's how the weather's been for a few days now. A break in the clouds  <b>at 3:35 pm this afternoon</b> afforded a welcome photography opportunity as <b>K pod passed Bush Point on their way north in Admiralty Inlet</b>. From marrying up the time this picture was taken and watching a large male foraging closer to the Whidbey side, it seems we were engaging with<b> K21 (Cappuccino)</b>. It's a long time since I saw this fabulous whale (though they're all fabulous) with the dramatic, bold saddle-patch, or any of K pod, so this was an early thanksgiving gift. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:15 pm -</b> watching <b>K pod from 1 mile south of Bush Pt. </b>as they are approaching, slowly, foraging and now some direction changes from some individuals but likely due to foraging, most are still slowly headed toward Bush Pt. Was lucky enough to see one juvenile do a full breach - always such a blessing to see them go by! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:33 p.m. - </b>We're seeing dorsals trending north and foraging mid-channel between<b> Foulweather Bluff and the north side of Mutiny Bay</b>. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1430 -</b> Chilkat leaving<b> K pod</b> still foraging (and appear to be finding fish!) as they move steadily but slowly northbound at Mutiny Bay.
<br/><b>1426 p.m. - K21 and K37 here with us now, Mutiny Bay</b>. Definitely in some salmon! -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:10 - Orca</b> Sighting. Spotted at yellow separation zone marker<b> north of Foulweather Bluff</b>. -Jim West

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:27 p.m. - Ks</b> are trending away towards <b>Whidbey Island</b> as they approach Double Bluff as viewed from <b>Point No Point</b>.
<br/><b>1:10 p.m. -</b> watching from <b>Point No Point</b> as they move steadily north. -Connie Bickerton

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Another Male (dorsal Tika like) is east of mid channel trailing, with another  male (4th) on west side with few other females/ young who are at the moment porpoising just south of Kingston (sightline). All steady northbound at steady pace across calm seas and balmy temperatures. Looking like K pod due to numbers whales and males but by no means from my distance can I confirm.

Below are my photos of what I think was<b> K pod (<i>confirmed - ALB</i>) K44 Ripple</b> (born 2010)! Such a big handsome boy now. Here's a surface sequence of him while K pod was feeding and cruising north about 1pm today in Admiralty Inlet!...they were taken with my iPhone. We did a whale watch tour for our annual staff/celebration day. We were excited to see the whales and did have one helluva choppy ride back to Anacortes but totally worth it! :) I'm not sure of our exact location on the boat but know <b>the whales were heading north through Admiralty Inlet</b> when we crossed paths. There may have been about a dozen (hard to count) spread across the water and on either side of the boat. Small groups would cluster and swim, surface, splash and submerge in tight circles with mixes of tail flips and small breaches then continue swimming north to repeat this action again. It seemed like they might have been feeding? -Codi Hamblin

My first ever DOUBLE SPYHOP!! <b>Just north and slightly west of Protection Island</b> Not the best quality but definitley the best moment from our surprise encounter with <b>K's and Js</b> today! I so was not ready for this and it happened so fast, I am surprised I was even able to get it somewhat in focus. This was part of a larger, very close knit group that seemed to be socializing and very surface active with a lot of rolling and splashing. Others were spread far and wide in foraging mode. Really wish we could have gotten a top-down look, they were also somewhat chatty on our hydrophone. That's<b> K16 Opus</b> spyhopping in the middle.

<br/><i>Puget Sound Bottlenose dolphins update - It's a match! Through many sighing reports (some submitted by many of you to Orca Network) Cascadia Research, in collaboration with their California colleagues, have matched one of the visting Puget Sound bottlenose dolphins to an individual known as "Miss". She is part of a California coastal stock and is well known to researchers, first photographed in southern California in 1983!</i>

Coastal killer whales - November 12 - Hello!! I was at <b>Cape Flattery in Neah Bay this morning around 10 am</b>. We aren't sure how many there were but out in the distance we saw<b> orcas passing up the Strait of Juan de Fuca behind Tatoosh Island</b>....they seemed to be going up into the Strait. Under Vancouver island and north of the Olympic peninsula. I would say there had to be <b>about 4?</b> They were very far away, and I couldn't tell you if there were any males. As we were watching we also saw quite large pod of harbor porpoises in the numbers of probably 20-40. We also saw two large Stellars playing together below the cliffs! -Audrey Long

November 11 - Strait of Georgia - I would also like your help in reviewing another video taken last Saturday (Nov 11) of <b>two transient Orcas hunting and injuring or possibly killing a young humpback calf</b>. (video below) -CJ Johnson
<br/>Filmed <b>off Vancouver Island (Qualicum Beach, 30 miles north of Nanaimo BC)</b>. Low light and very far away so I apologize for the video quality. But the real shocker is whether the Orcas took down a Humpback whale...- Video by Nancy Argyle, November 11, 2017 (submitted by her son CJ Johnson)

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - November 10 - Here's how my day was today ....heard that <b>Biggs T137s were heading north in Saratoga Passage</b>, so off to Shangrila Shores to watch them northbound ....to my house to see them continue north, to <b>Harrington Lagoon</b> where they were closer to shore, to <b>Long Point</b> to see them near Penn Cove, to the <b>Coupeville Boat Launch</b> to watch them enter Penn Cove,<b> to the mussel rafts </b>to watch them have lunch (seal) by the rafts, <b>to the Coupeville wharf </b>to see them begin their exit from Penn Cove, and <b>then to TOBY's to watch them leave Penn Cove</b> - from the nice warm Tavern. Such a tough life! And to meet up with so many Orca Dorks - more than I've ever seen watching whales along Whidbey Shores. Particularly Bonnie Gretz and Michelle Booker (and Daniel)! Then ... the dilemma - if we just have one drink at Toby's we'd have time to head to the west side of Whidbey to see K-pod and the L54s as they head north T137 - mom - born 1983...her offspring: T137A, T137D, T137B. hmmmmm. -Jill Hein

<b>3:10 p.m. - 3 orcas in the west end of Penn Cove </b>by the mussel rafts, heading back out now. -Brian Miller

<b>2:15 p.m. - T137 and her youngest T137D</b>. - Lovely afternoon with <b>T137's</b>.T137A born 2002. First saw them just off Long Point at the entrance to Penn Cove, then watched at the mussel docks as they made a kill, and then they took their sweet time heading out. Lots of people saw them and were so excited!

<b>9:50 a.m. -</b> The <b>pair of bottlenose dolphins is hanging out off West Seattle</b> again this morning...just spotted off <b>Me Kwa Mooks Park</b>, southbound, and another watcher said they have been circling there for a while. (I got a good look at their beaks through binos, they were raising them out of the water as they surfaced. Solid grey, no eye stripe.) -Stephanie Raymond

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:50 a.m. -</b> As I was leaving<b> Me Kwa Mooks</b> a pedestrian told me his wife had called him fifteen minutes prior claiming "the same whales that were by<b> Lincoln Park</b> yesterday" had just passed by heading north. I tend to believe it was more likely the dolphins I'd been watching for 40 minutes, but thought I'd share anyway.
<br/><b>8:30 a.m. -</b> I have been watching <b>two dolphins</b> milling and apparently feeding around the white floats at the south end of M<b>e Kwa Mooks Park in West Seattle</b> for about half an hour. I believe these are commons and not bottlenose. Sorry, the camera on my phone is inoperable. (I did not get a real look at beaks at all. I thought I saw an eye stripe but was having a very difficult time assessing coloration. Early morning sun was reflecting gold for sure, and may very well have been responsible for the "eye stripes" I thought I saw. Dorsals seemed less commanding than that of the single bottlenose I saw in same area a few weeks ago.) -Jason Lee Bell

It's been a while and I still have a ton of catching up to do with photo editing and posting, but here are some shots from today's orca encounters on the Chilkat Express! We met up with <b>K Pod and the L54s all traveling together</b> in a resting line just south of Seattle! So amazing to see so many whales in the same spot! We also saw a spyhop from <b>K16 Opus </b>early in the encounter just as they all grouped up and began their afternoon nap....From my photos, I was able to ID all extant members of <b>K Pod, including K27 and K44 </b>who I did not notice while we were on scene. -Justine Buckmaster, Chilkat Express

Around <b>12:20pm</b> got on scene to find a very large group of <b>tightly bundled up orcas</b> just west of mid channel<b> between Blake and Vashon Islands heading south</b>. To the south could see a few orcas heading northwest bound towards the larger group. They <b>soon tucked in with the others creating one beautiful large group.</b> This powerful mass of lovely beings continued steady southbound in resting mode (save for with one spyhop, an inverted roll and occasional slight tail slap). By <b>12:55 they were south of the Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry lanes</b>, by now had moved over to mid channel, trending even further east still heading southbound. By<b> 1:25pm they they had made it as far as Brace Point where K21</b> then veered towards mid channel as he went under, others followed. On their next surface at <b>1:26 they surfaced going in the opposite direction</b>, now all  heading northbound a little spread out, but soon regrouped and for several minutes made little to no progress while logging. Last saw them about <b>1:40pm off Brace Point</b> slowly heading north. <b>All of K pod with the L54s, L84 &amp; L88 in resting. </b>Inexpressible...(Thanks to Justine Buckmaster for ID'ing K pod and the L54s). -Alisa Lemire Brooks

November 8 - We were so lucky today! Not only did we get to see the majesty of Southern Resident Killer Whales in a resting line, we also witnessed and exciting high speed chase/hunt by <b>Transient Killer Whales!</b> These are the <b>T137s</b> and we were treated to a BIG spyhop and a couple of tail lobs from bull <b>T137A</b>! -Justine Buckmaster, Chilkat Express, November 8, 2017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:20 p.m. - T137 and her 2 youngest north side of Apple Cove Pt.</b> Her adult son T137A has now moved over to the west of them and is traveling behind and more inshore on the Kitsap side still steady southbound. Soon they'll be in acoustic range of the residents
<br/><b>3:00 p.m. - look like chasing something. T137, T137B, T137D Currently west of mid channel out from Eglon</b> heading directionally towards Apple Cove PT, Kingston. T137A is to the east and ahead of them, as if they are coralling some cetacean. They have been cruising at fast pace. 
<br/><b>2:48 p.m. - this is T137s</b> and look to be on or done with a kill. 2-3 miles south of Possession Point. spyhop, tail lobs, circling, chasing. But hauling southbound fast.
<br/><b>2:25 p.m. -  From Possession Point </b>spotted the pod south of us maybe 1-2 miles. Heading that way for better look and hopefully get IDs. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12 noon -</b> WSF monitors just saw <b>three orcas between the Mukilteo lighthouse and Hat Island</b>, so just north of the ferry lane, <b>heading north</b> off Everett. They saw one adult male and one that looked small.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:59 a.m. - Orca just north of ferry, Mukilteo side. 4- 5 whales (1 male),</b> very active with tail slaps. Too distant to identify. No binoculars or camera. I watched these guys from the NOAA building in Mukilteo, they had turned southbound and crossed the ferry line, then I lost sight of them. -Jill Hein

November 8 - Watching from South side of TTP (<b>Three Tree Point, Burien</b>) and watching <b>a large group of dolphins</b> just off the point heading north but lingering off the point. -Kim Baumgartner

November 8 - Not sure if anyone else saw <b>a small pod of Orcas around 2 pm-ish in Elliot Bay</b> immediately south of the ferry terminal, and very close to shore/piers - I was heading northbound on the viaduct when I saw them - not sure how I didn't wreck - I assume they were T's - saw 3 to 4 fins and a couple tail slaps and several gulls flying overhead that looked ready to share in the late lunch. -Tony Bahnik
<br/>(<i>WSF monitors for the Coleman dock project did not see any orcas or dolphins in Elliot Bay at this time. They did have sea lions feasting on salmon - ALB</i>)

November 8 - <b>K pod and L54's were in Puget Sound</b> on November 8. <b>Beautiful L88 Wavewalker, sole survivor of the L2 matriline, who now associates with the L54s. Off West Seattle</b>. They were in resting mode and often surfaced in synchronicity...we have seen this pod less than five times this year, and for many others, even less than one. This is where they should be and....aren't. Luckily, the chum salmon had a much better run this year (comparatively) and that is what they are looking for right now. Hoping they come back soon! -Renee Beitzel

<b>10:00 a.m. - A pod of orcas</b>, looks like transients, <b>off the east coast of Decatur Island, heading south down Rosario Strait</b>. Several Breaches and tail flaps. Quite a sight for all the people on the ferry. 10 a.m. on Tuesday November
7th. Well I saw them from the ferry. I didn't get any pics and they were pretty far in the distance but they were heading south just in front of James Island east of Decataur. I got a somewhat reasonably good look at two males hanging close together and noticed their dorsal fins were very pointed, more like transients. I then saw females and calves in the distance cavorting around....I saw <b>about 10 orcas</b> at various times....hat is probably about the best estimate of numbers I can give (plus or minus 2-3)...That is about all I can say. I wanted to send it off to you right away so that whale watching boats might have a chance to encounter them. Did anyone go check them out? I'd be curious at what anyone found out about them. -Mariann Carrasco
<br/>(<i><b>Ls</b> were up north the day before and found in Juan de Fuca later this day. <b>K pod</b> showed up in Puget Sound the next morning, Nov 8th. No pods of Bigg's this size were documented around the San Juans - ALB</i>)

November 7 -<b> 7:58 a.m. - </b>So, on the <b>Bremerton ferry</b> now, and saw something I hadn't seen before (between commuting via ferry and my passion for boating, I've seen ALOT out here!) Just looked out (that little bay on the north side of rich passage just after the east entrance) to see 3 dolphins leaping in unison. That's a first...They leapt together probably 5 times like that.  All the same distance apart and synchronized....Anyway, I remember reading on this page over the summer there were reports of a sighting of southern dolphins in Puget Sound. Perhaps these were them? -Rhonda RaderJungquist

Southern Residents - <b>7:03 p.m. </b>- moment of quiet after <b>a lot of vocalizing by all</b>.
<br/><b>6:33 p .m. - after quiet time, burst of L pod calls.</b> Followed by about 25 minutes of continuous variety of <b>calls by Js, Ks, and Ls </b>that has been all too absent this year. <b>A lot of Ks calls (S16, S17), many S1 calls, more S37s and some S40s?</b>

This comment posted <b>1819 - </b>Lots of <b>percussives</b> were still visible when it got too dark to see dorsals... I was wondering if they're finally having a superpod. Even though it was hard to see what all was going on it just had the aura of a superpod, with all the crazy splashing in every direction. At one point there was a triple breach - too bad it was 4-5 miles away!
<br/><b>1750 - They are all SB now</b>. I've seen at least 25 whales but I'm sure there are more - poor vis with white caps and rain.
<br/><b>1745 - Far off ones were going north</b>, now some maybe a mile out going south.
<br/><b>1738 - The only ones I see are at least a couple miles offshore</b>.
<br/><b>1730 - Just got to Land Bank they are breaching like crazy</b> offshore. They're also doing lots of weird surface activity making huge splashes with their tails, it's very bizarre
<br/><b>1708 - Sounding more like regular Js</b> now, and getting a little louder. Actually sounded like <b>Js and Ks</b>.
<br/><b>1707 - they do sound bizarre!</b><b></b> -Monika

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:09 p.m. -</b> The whales are a good distance from shore, maybe 4 miles...slowly going up, at the moment. I am hearing calls of all three pods, but they are too far offshore to know exactly who and now it's too dark. <b>Lots of K (kitten) call but the L54s</b> make that call too. Hearing also the L pod Up-Tick (<b>S19</b>) and <b>lots of J calls</b> too. Fun to think that maybe they are all here...

November 1 - <b>Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet</b> - Day report: Fascinating pass yesterday, Nov. 1, by <b>members of J pod </b><b></b>were taken from <b>Vista Way, Whidbey Is. from 11:33 to 12:28 then from the lighthouse at Bush Pt. from 12:37 to 1:08.</b> I think I got the leaders heading north up Admiralty Inlet in the first shots, and the last ones were passing Bush Pt. at the end. The leaders were acting normal, very spread out with little surface action until 11:37. I thought they had all passed so I came back home to get the car to head to Bush Pt. when Susan saw the rowdy group through the bigeyes coming up slowly, close to shore. I went back out to the bluff and shot at less than a mile range from<b> 11:50 to 12:28</b>. Arrived at Bush Pt. at 12:37 where Dick Snowberger and Sandra Pollard had been for a while with the rowdy group approaching 1/2 mile south and less than 1/4 mile from shore in a tide rip. The closeups of intense group surface activity continued until 12:44 when the rowdy group disappeared and drifted westward and even south before trending back northward. At that point out past mid-channel about 5-6 of them started logging for several minutes. At least a couple of others were breaching way across beyond the south end of Marrowstone. <b>J27 south of Bush Point.</b> Whatever was going on with the intense tactile socializing remains a mystery. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Being fortunate in seeing members of the Southern Resident community tends to be a bitter-sweet experience knowing the continuing challenges they face. Living on Whidbey Island we were fortunate to enjoy a mesmerizing encounter with <b>some of J-pod breathtakingly close to shore</b> today and witnessed a range of social and tactile behaviors, including one 'surf whale' taking full advantage of a tanker's wake. The whales seemed to be in no hurry to exit Admiralty Inlet, often just logging at the surface and milling. After their prolonged absence this summer, it was a privilege to have them back again in Puget Sound. All the photos (below by Richard Snowberger) were taken from Bush Point early afternoon (between approx. noon and 1:00).

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:30 p.m. -</b> some still passing Bush Point, 25-30 total. Very strange socializing by one group. (That trailing rowdy group that kept writhing around on each other and breaching and spyhopping close to shore right up to Bush Pt. then drifting off the west and even back south, then logging all together for maybe five minutes, while all the rest except those breachers across on the Olympic side just kept plodding north).

<br/><b>11:45 a.m. - they are 1 mile south of Bush Pt. A tight pod of 5 or 6</b> has been hunting something for the last 15 minutes, behavior and fins look more like possible Transients, but unable to see the prey or saddle patches yet. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
