<h3><center>July 2006 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>July 31, 2006</b>
<br/><br/>
Received a report from Robert Anthony, a commercial fisherman of 2 <b>orcas </b>- 1 male, 1 female - <b>1:45 pm</b>, heading north off the coast at 41.47.06 N  124.24.01 W (18.0 km WxSW of Klamath <b>CA</b>). The male had a notch 1/3 the way up his dorsal fin.
<br/>*<br/>
Around <b>5 pm</b> the [<b>orcas</b>] who had gone north yesterday came back south widely spread across Haro Strait. The L12's traveling north, met lines of whales that were rapidly porpoising south just off Lime Kiln Point. Mega preceded the greeting with two mega breaches. (See photos: http://orcanetwork.org/images/photopage.html). After mingling for awhile and spreading out even further, the whales headed south.  They then engaged in great behaviors, including multiple breaches, tail slaps, tail throws and other percussive and non-percussive behavior for hours off Hannah Heights. They seemed to switch from family groups, to mating groups, to foraging groups and back frequently.  When I stopped watching them at 8pm, they were widely spread from near Eagle Point to Edwards Point, inshore all the way out to several miles off shore. I also saw lots of salmon jumping close to the shore.

Cascadia Research offshore survey - Greg Schorr and I did a survey out of Westport on Sunday. The weather was beautiful, and evidently the fishing was great for everyone:  there were at least 70 sportfishing boats about 10 miles out, and a number of <b>humpbacks </b>lunge feeding at the surface just a little further offshore (we identified eight individuals). In addition to the usual <b>harbor porpoise</b> and <b>dall's porpoise</b> sightings, we had a very nice encounter with about 40 <b>Risso's Dolphins</b>. The group was traveling slowly, and included several young calves and one neonate- photographs revealed fetal folds visible on the animals side. Sightings of Risso's Dolphins have been infrequent off Washington, and this was our first encounter with them since we started surveying the area regularly 2 years ago, so it made Sunday especially fun.

Yards off the Hannah Heights community beach there were several <b>orcas </b>seemingly involved in mating type behavior, with much rolling around, diving together, and orca snuggling, without any visible sea snakes. To my surprise, two of the seemingly amorous whales were J2 Granny and J27 Blackberry. Was she teaching him a thing or two about a thing or two??  Who knows! When the superpod moved north to Land Bank, many of the whales spent more than an hour close in to shore, breaching, tail lobbing, spy hopping and in general, delighting me and my family from New Orleans. There was also lots of amorous behavior, with the calves bouncing around overhead.  When the superpod went north, the L12's split off  and came back south.

Regarding the information on the <b>Minke </b>Whale Project - I realize that Jonathan Stern is studying the Minke up in your area but I thought I would send 2 photos that I took of a Minke in the Santa Barbara Channel <b>CA </b>off the coast of California (from the condor Express). I have seen Minkes off the California coast before but they only showed themselves once or twice before disappearing and I was not able to catch any photos. To everyone's delight, this one hung around for about 8 minutes!

<b>Orca </b>(L's) went through Active Pass this afternoon around <b>2 pm</b>. A large group of around 15 were quite a bit ahead of a group
of 5. A couple of spectacular tandem breeches partway into the Pass. Then a rapid travelling part way down the pass in a chorus line. (this is a "resting line" - see photos on our photo page at: http://orcanetwork.org/images/photopage.html (two have been ID'd as L74 &amp; L79)

This <b>morning</b>, <b>J-Pod</b> went North! Then having had their trip north, J's came back down Georgia Strait and headed directly for Eastpoint. Not many boats on the water today, so most everyone was fairly spread out. The whales were porpoising as they approached the point, and when they were inside of Boiling Reef, we saw many breaches, tail slaps, and other percussives. The whales were bucking a pretty strong floodtide, but still were managing to make 3-5 knot headway.  We left the whales still passing Eastpoint heading towards Turn Point.

<b>J Pod</b> at the southern tip of Henry Is., this evening at about <b>8:15 PM</b>, headed south. I had been out with the grandsons fishing. A great finish to the evening.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> finally came south tonight and passed Land Bank at about <b>10:00 p.m</b>. I first picked them up on the radio at about 9:30 p.m. as I passed Lime Kiln. There was no vocalizing, but some slow, loud echolocation trains.  After about 15 minutes they started vocalizing. I listened for about 15 minutes before I saw them. There were a number of breaches, including a couple of double breaches, lots of synchronized swimming in circles at the surface, rolling around, and a few tail slaps. We could still hear them, but couldn't see them when they finally passed.

As we approached East Point, the captain sighted <b>Orca </b>fins ahead. It was part of <b>J Pod</b> - just the J2 matriline and J1. These 6 whales continued travelling east in the Strait of Georgia and we left them a few miles off Point Roberts at approx. <b>5 PM</b>.  Meanwhile, the rest of J Pod was apparently resting near Java Rocks, westbound. We observed a fair amount of activity - spyhops, breaches, tail slaps and cartwheels, accompanies by plenty of vocal activity on the hydrophone. On two occasions, we observed J14 spyhop and her calf, J40, porpoised past her chin. J30 was showing off alot, with lots of backswimming &amp; pec flippers in the air.

This is a bit late but we spotted <b>Orcas </b>from the deck of our home on the west side of Tsawwassen. The whales were quite spread out, with some breeching, heading north from Point Roberts towards Roberts Bank.

I was with my family last night at whale watching park on San Juan Island yesterday and we saw lots of <b>orcas</b>. Many large males and even some babies swam by. An interpreter said it was members of J, K and L pods.
<br/>P. Hobart and family
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>morning </b>had <b>all 3 pods</b> coming in from Victoria towards False Bay. The whales weren't in a hurry, and it made for a relaxing start of the day. In the <b>afternoon </b>we encountered a mixture of J's, K's, and L's north of Kellett Bluff. First a nice pass with J27 Blackberry leisurely searching the incoming flood for fish. A nice treat of having J11 and J39 mixing it up and being rambunctuous as the little guy rolled over mom's back, did a few small spyhops, but really raised the gooseflesh when he stopped, turned towards the boat, and did a beautiful, long vocalization. We were off to ourselves when L79 Skana showed up and began to forage back and forth, spinning in a tighter circle until he popped his head up and showed off his prize of a huge salmon!  A few seconds later, all that was showing out of his mouth was a big tail, and the gulp! Tons of vocalizations, more belly-flop breaches, tail slaps, a few small spyhops by the youngsters.

About 4:30 PM, it was J Pod in Tumbo Channel. As the pod approached Tumbo Island westbound, a few individuals crossed the ridge in as little as 10 feet of water and entered Tumbo Channel, with more than 1/2 the pod still on the Strait of Georgia side. It wasn't long before the rest of the pod found their way around to the channel as well, and they began making their way slowly south. As was reported, the pod was in fine form, with lots of spyhops, tail slaps, some breaches and cartwheels.
<br/>Joan Lopez
<br/>Vancouver Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
A small pod of <b>orcas </b>splashed down from the north through Tumbo Channel starting around <b>4:15 p.m.</b> and finally headed out to Boundary Pass toward the south around 5 p.m.  This is unusual territory for orcas in the summer but it was sure fun to see. It appeared there were about 15 whales but they were too far out from shore to identify. There was a great deal of spy hopping and fin flapping.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:22 PM</b>, <b>Ks</b> going north at Hannah Hights, west side, San Juan Is.
<br/>Capt. Jim, Maya's Charters...
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
With word of <b>J POD</b> coming down from Turn Point, about 10 minutes after sunset (<b>2115</b>) and one mile north, we encountered J1, 2 and the sprouter lads.  We could see the rest of the pod about an eighth of a mile up the strait.

A fine whale show this <b>evening </b>around <b>8:30</b>. <b>J pod</b>, spread out, heading east through Active Pass. Very active around Georgeson Bay -- breaching, tail slapping, spy hopping. Right in front of us, swimming on backs at the surface and under the water.

Today we had the <b>J's and K's</b> off the west side almost all day long, often playing to near capacity crowds from shore. They were just north of Beaumont Shoals at about <b>9:15 a.m</b>, crossed Haro Strait to Land Bank and Lime Kiln, and then shuffled up and down the west side most of the day. There was lots of surface activity, many tail slaps, tail throws, a number of breaches and much foraging.  While there were many boats, the whales did not seem bothered. In the afternoon I saw three young calves traveling south together off Land Bank. J26 Mike and J1 Ruffles seemed to be the babysitters, as the three little ones would swim from one to the other, and back. Both Mike and Ruffles were kelping as they babysat. K pod put on an amazing show at one point, porpoising in unison tight into shore. This was after they had spent about 45 minutes really tight into shore off Lime Kiln Point, playing and foraging. K40 Raggedy and K21 Cappucino spent a lot of time off Land Bank close in to shore rolling around each other and hanging out. It was after that that they went out to the middle and found the porpoise. J pod went north around <b>2:30 pm</b>, while K pod went south. K pod was off Salmon Bank heading further south after 7 pm.

I and my students arrived around <b>9 AM</b>, and learned that <b>J-pod</b> was across Haro, just south of Discovery Island, just milling around with  no particular direction of travel. Around <b>10:35 AM</b> roughly 15+ <b>orca </b>came from the south, perhaps three-quarters to a mile offshore of Lime Kiln. Spread out, and moving to the north, with a few of them circling and doubling back, until approx. 11:10 AM. At least one mother with a young one in the lead of that pass. Then, from around 11:30 to 12:30, a second pass--they had turned around and headed back south, much closer to shore this time. Seemed like more of them in this pass; did they pick some up who were coming down from the north? J-1 we think, a little further off, but several others VERY close to shore, just outside the kelp line, from just north of the Light house all the way down past the Lime Kiln overlook and even south of that. Again spread out greatly, and leisurely moving south, with several groups doubling back and circling around. A third pass, from roughly 1:15 to 2:00 PM, moving fairly rapidly north with the tidal flow. Combined over these three viewings we saw, cart-wheels, tail slaps, pec. slaps, pec. waves, several spy-hops, tail slaps while up-side down, pec. slaps while up-side down, a combo. tail and pec. slap while upside down (love seeing those pretty white bellies just below the water surface), and one younger whale did at least 5 full breaches in succession. Some of the tail slaps so forceful, you could hear them even some distance away, and of course, many breaths heard as they came to the surface. Lots of close passes, giving all us shore-based watchers some GREAT viewing. Guess this was a good example of the "west side shuffle."

Katie Jones from the Center for Whale Research called in an interesting report this evening - out with Capt. Tom McMillen they observed <b>orcas </b>at <b>1650</b>, 3 miles off the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, San Juan Island - ID'd as <b>K40, K35 &amp; K16</b>, attacking &amp; playing with a porpoise.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:45pm</b> we spotted a single <b>sea otter</b> just outside the kelp about 1/4 mile west (North) of Eagle Point. It dove and came up with a large red urchin, rolling several times before settling on its back to eat. Then a river otter charged out from the rocky shoreline and both otters disappeared. About 15 minutes later a single river otter came very fast from the west back to the rocks. We did not see the sea otter again.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:45 a.m.</b>, there was another <b>sea otter</b> about 100' feet off the lighthouse at Lime Kiln Park, on its back, banging on something on its chest, did a barrel roll, and banging away again and another barrel roll. This makes almost 10 sea otter sightings in the last few weeks. Wonder if it's the same sea otter just taking a little vacation from his/her ususal hangout or will more than one be spotted at the same time one of these days...hum...

Just spoke with Shane. He's out on an evening tour and found a young <b>Gray Whale</b> at MacArthur Bank at about <b>7pm</b>. He said that it only looked to be 15 feet or so. No others were sighted and he was watching it for about a half hour. Poor little guy, he seems to have lost his way. Jami Nagel did get photos and she'll send them to you and/or Cascadia soon. It was a 3' chop so it was tough watching the little one.

The whales have been following a pattern of being in Active Pass and Canada in the early afternoon which has made reaching them quite difficult lately. Today we caught up with them just west of Otter Bay by North Pender Island. <b>J's and K's</b> were together with K's in the lead for the most part, with the bulk of J's behind. We saw K-26 (Lobo), J-1 (Ruffles), K-28 (Raven) with the new calf. We also saw K-40 (Raggedy) hanging very close to J-26 (Mike). We did see another mother with an older calf cruising along, and the calf was breaching about 4-6 times while cruising along with mom. They continued north and hit Active Pass around <b>3:30 - 4pm</b>. Our second trip, we heard that J's split from the K's and the J's continued to the Fraser River, While the K's went East towards Point Roberts.

<b>J's and K's</b> are traveling north up the west side of San Juan Island this morning (<b>10:00 AM</b>). They are spread out from Lime Kiln to Kellett Bluff. Later in the day while in my boat, I heard that the whales were up near the Coal Docks around <b>5:00 PM</b>.

<b>K pod</b> (approximately 17 of them at least) headed North past Hannah Heights area of SJI at <b>10:00am</b> this morning along with several J's (verified at the Lighthouse). Liesurely pass--- several came in very close to the shore by Lime Kiln.

This morning at <b>10:00a.m</b>. as <b>K Pod</b> was approaching Lime Kiln Lighthouse from the south (and with at least Blackberry J-27 mixed in with them) there was a <b>sea otter</b> about 20 feet off the kelp! This is the third sighting by the lighthouse in the last few weeks... then I got so involved in watching Sequim (K-12) - grandmother to new calf K-39 - as she traveled along with Raven (K-28) and calf K-39.

They continued past the south arm of the Fraser River, where they went in various directions, and were spread over miles. They eventually regrouped and turned back to the south. We left them heading southbound at about <b>4:30 PM</b>, once again passing the South Arm of the Fraser River. While we were in the vicinity we observed some foraging, with the whales chasing fish just below the surface, their dorsal fins slicing through the water. Lots of tail slapping going on today, much of it with whales swimming belly-up.

We had <b>L Pod</b> coming up the west side of San Juan Island near Low Island around <b>11:00 AM</b>. It was great to see L-41 Mega and others foraging as they fought the strong ebb tide. Even nicer was seeing K21 Cappucino with K40 Raggedy return to our waters after "disappearing" for awhile (perhaps with the rest of the L's that came it?). Lots of percussives with multiple cartwheels, tailslaps, and breaching.

We found <b>L's</b> about 3 miles off of the Cattle Point lighthouse, heading in no particular direction. Lots of percussives, lunges, and multiple changes of directions, followed by long (3 minute+) dives.  Then they'd hang for extended periods at the surface, again non-directional. Lots of incredible vocalizations with so many distinct L-Pod calls. In the <b>afternoon</b>, we were treated to <b>J Pod</b> as they headed west past Iceberg towards Cattle Point. The whales were spread out, with J-1 Ruffles outside of most of the group. For the first time, I saw more than just a "sea snake", but actual mating just under the surface!!! I was so stunned I didn't get a picture until after they were "finished". It was J-28 Polaris, and not sure on this, but the male appeared to be J-33 Keet! I'm trying to get confirmation on this male ID, as I thought they didn't "practice" except with the older females. Anyway, it was a truly amazing display.  Then unexpectedly, J-22 and her two offspring showed up out of nowhere and passed slowly off our bow. J-38 Cookie was in fine form, and had orange spots still under the chin (leftovers or perhaps a bit of the remaining orange tint?). When last we left the orcas, they were approaching Eagle Point with K's and L's heading down island to meet them. We spotted L-79 Skana heading right for the J's. Lots of vocalizations again, this time a mixture of J and L Pod calls.

Our afternoon trip met up with <b>J Pod</b> near the south end of Lummi Island. They had been heading Southbound, but past the bottom of Lummi Island they started milling about in an area with some tide rips. By this time, the incoming tide was likely slowing their southbound progress. It didn't take long and they had turned and headed back northbound, but at a very slow pace, as though they were just letting the tide carry them. Some were swimming in their matrilines, some singly or in pairs. J1 and J2 were leisurely travelling side by side. We left J Pod drifting in the general direction of Lummi Rocks at 5 PM.

For the last several days, however, it seems only part of K-Pod has been around (about 14-16 whales). K21 and K40, along with a few others, seem to be separate, perhaps traveling with L-Pod?

<b>K's</b> engaged in high speed foraging north past Land Bank at about <b>noon</b>, with a lot of submarining and low porpoising. J's followed about an hour later much more slowly, with the trailers just hanging out at Land Bank for about 1/2 hour. Then K's came back south and joined up with with the J's to travel north. At about <b>7pm </b>as I was heading into town, I saw orcas traveling south. I got no ID's because as I stopped to watch, a <b>sea otter</b> popped up in the path of the orcas off Lime Kiln. It stayed around as 5 orcas, including 2 sprouters, passed, then it dove down.

Cascadia Research received some sighting reports over the week-end and on Monday morning of a possible <b>humpback </b>whale (some reports were of a gray whale) in south Puget Sound. On Monday afternoon, after a fresh sighting near Johnson Point (NE of Olympia), Cascadia Biologists (John Calambokidis and Gretchen Steiger) did a survey and were able to find the animal and confirm it was a juvenile humpback whale. The animal did have several fairly fresh injuries including one made from a fairly small propeller that appeared to be from a collision with a small boat. One injury near the head appeared to be more serious but it was hard to judge the extent or degree of threat it posed to the animal.

My husband and I were out Friday <b>between 4 and 6 pm</b> enjoying the flat water and the beautiful day. We found a small group of [<b>orcas</b>], perhaps 10-12 near Eagle Cove, SJI, moving close along shore. Lots of fishing behavior. As they approached the Cattle Point area they went out further toward the green buoy, some fishing behaviors, but also several breaches and tail slaps. Whale boats all around and a couple not very aware of where all the whales were. 
We just drifted, and around 5 pm about 10 whales spent a good 30 minutes fishing all around us. One large male stayed at the surface a lot, breached twice, and then we hear him "speak." It was a magic moment. Quite a long vocalization. Shortly after that, the group headed toward the southern tip of Lopez. There were at least two calves, maybe three, each fishing with their mom. One was quite small, with a very cute-sounding little blow.

So far, the best way to sum up the behaviors of the <b>orcas </b>this summer would be "just when you think you see a pattern, the whales go and change it". Today we had J's &amp; K's heading up San Juan Island all afternoon, but just before we got on scene, the whales decided to do a split, with J's continuing north past Turn Point and up Swanson Channel. K's in the meantime decided to speed swim back down San Juan Island.  We had a wonderful viewing of K28 Raven with her new little guy K39. K39 was speed swimming with mom, coming completely out of the water every time! Also traveling nearby were K12 and K22. They continued traveling down Stuart Island towards Battleship Island doing about 8-9 knots.  At one point, K39 was about 200 yards behind mom, and was vocalizing like crazy as he went by the boat (I can only imagine he was probably asking mom to slow down!)  As he continued to porpoise after mom, you'd see this little flash of black and peach come up.

On our afternoon trip, we met up with <b>Orcas </b>near the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal. The first group we encountered were believed to be some <b>L pod</b> whales.They were spread out over quite a distance, in all directions, quite far offshore. We decided to check out the inshore whales, which turned out to be <b>J Pod</b>. Ruffles and Granny were in the lead at first, but then decided to check out a container ship being pushed to dock by two tugs. On this occasion, they did not put themselves between the ship and the dock as had been reported on a recently from WA State, but they did go quite close before coming back out of the port area. During the time we were with the whales, we observed a lot of foraging activity with some deep dives, and some great lunges at the surface. For a time, it appeared that J19 might be teaching the lunge technique to her calf, as we observed her doing this numerous times in the same vicinity, with the calf nearby. They did this for several minutes, then porpoised off side by side to join up with the rest of the pod, who by now, were definitely heading towards the Birch Bay area.

We have a view of the whole of Case Inlet as far south as Herron and Hartstine Island. This morning I was kayaking between our home and Stretch Point (the northern tip of Stretch Island) at about <b>ten in the morning</b>, when I came upon two groups of <b>orcas</b>.
One was a mature animal with a less mature one close by, and four other animals were in a group about two hundred yards away. Only the mature animal had the very tall right triangle dorsal fin. He also did some tail flapping; slapping the water, and jumping out of the water with a half twist. Either six or seven seen. The location was roughly 122 degrees 49' W  and 47 degrees 20' N. They were traveling South from Rocky Bay towards Herron Island. There have been a very large number of seals in the area quite recently. It is possible they were feeding on the seals.
