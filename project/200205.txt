Hi 
<br/>It seems Jpod is into long distance jogging going up Haro through Active Pass back down Rosario and over again. 
Kpod seems to like the S.E. side of San Juan Is. these last few days. 
Lpod seems to have said ok been there, done that, let's go back out west for a day or so.

Hi 
<br/>With Lpod only today J and K went North. 
In the morning they were around Eagle Pt. to False Bay hardly moving at all. 
<br/>The afternoon they had their faces into a flood tide and were off Seabird Pt. (Discovery Is.) all afternoon. 
I thought I had them all but Dave from the Center told me that L5 subpod had gone N. and later I heard the L5's had turned and were coming back South. 
No info after about 1730 L's still near Discovery and J and K up North 
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
We left Js and Ks going north past N. Pender Is. at 5:00 PM and then Ls 
going west past Victoria at 8:00 PM. There was a Gray spotted off Eagle 
Cove midday.

L pod was reported heading east back into the Straits of Juan de Fuca, K pod was reported doing the "west side shuffle" back and forth along the west side of San Juan Island, and J pod was continuing its circular route up the west side of  San Juan, up through the northern islands, and back down through Rosario Strait.

Hi 
<br/>Was only out in the morning (May 26) but had Kpod and 2 minkes in the salmon bank area (off south San Juan Island). I understand K's spent most of the day there.

Besides the usual sightings of Orcas and Minkes, our vessel Olympas reported seeing two Humpbacks off Sooke at 1300 May 25. They were heading South.
<br/>Best regards,
<br/>Captain Nesset
<br/>The Undersea Company
<br/>*<br/>
L pod off Victoria early 0745 going to Race Rocks was on scene myself at 1042 just W. of Sooke with L41 ,L57, L58 and the 3 growing boys L73, L74 and L75. Still no new calves for me. 
<br/>The afternoon trip we had a female and calf Humpback pair, the first Humpback for me in 3-4 years. 3 miles S. of Sheringham Pt. (west of Sooke). 
<br/>I trust you have updates on J's and K's my reports were between the top end of Rosario St. and Pt. Roberts this afternoon.
<br/>Ron Bates,
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
L pod west-bound past Victoria, last seen past Otter Pt, still headed west toward the coast.
<br/>J's (&amp; possibly K pod as well) were going outbound through Active Pass at 10:30 am. Dan Wills of Eclipse Charters saw them at Pt. Roberts, headed south. There was another group about 10 miles north of J's, also heading south (K pod?). A Vancouver whale watch company reported whales on their way back near Steveston, most likely K pod. <br/>And Shane reported a minke whale near Misha on their way back in as well. 
<br/>*<br/>
Hi Susan et al. - 
<br/>It seems like J pod has slowed down for a bit after the fairly speedy 
travel the last few days - we were with them this afternoon (1:00 p.m.) 
for about an hour at Pt. Roberts where they were doing quite a bit of 
milling, traveling slow, breaches, taillobs...a few hours later (3:30 
p.m.) they were reportedly still in the same area. 
<br/>On my way home on Lummi tonight at 7:30 p.m. spotted them (I'm assuming 
it was same pod - they were quite far off shore) off west side of Lummi 
Island. They were milling out there in mid-channel and taking their 
time. Lovely day...

<br/>Bill, Colleen and the crew 
<br/>*<br/>
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called in this report:
L pod inbound in the Strait, near Sooke this morning, then off the Victoria waterfront around 4 pm. J pod made their circular route through Rosario strait, then were headed out the Strait of Juan de Fuca toward L's at 4, porpoising toward them for the big family reunion. No positive ID's of K's yet, but they are possibly with L's as well. 
The Summer Superpod Season is here!!!!

Hi Susan: We've been seeing lots of feeding pits here at East Point (Saratoga Passage) every morning at low tide. Last night (Sunday) at midnight we actually heard and faintly saw what I took to be one gray whale feeding. It was there for about an hour.

<br/>*<br/>
Sunday at 9:30 am, Paul Evans reported J pod at Burrow's Island Lighthouse, heading toward Deception Pass, then turning &amp; heading toward the south end of Lopez Island. Shane was with them from 12:30 at Salmon Bank until around 2:30 just past Pile Pt. He also reported 1 minke off American Camp, San Juan Island - with 2 distinct nicks on the anterior portion of its dorsal fin. Also saw lots of small juvenile salmon in the strait, he believes were coho. And another interesting note that J pod has been seen in Rosario Strait 8 times during the last 12 days.

Hi Susan and Howie, 
<br/>I was completely delighted by 2 Gray whales immediately outside of the Doghouse on Saturday - they were there feeding and rolling, etc., for over an hour and a half...
Approx. 3:00pm to 4:20 or so. It was absolutely stunning, and the tips even improve when we see whales! They love the naturalist/waitress/bartender idea!
They immediately started to head South after a boat approached, and got much too close. 
Also, two Dall's porpoise around 4:50 heading North up Saratoga Passage (from the Doghouse view).

Hi All 
<br/>Jpod came down Rosario St. this morning and back to the west side of San Juan Is. this afternoon. Mid Rosario at 0930 and going towards Turn Pt. at 1600 this afternoon. 
Transient T14 was going West off Becher Bay (between Race Rocks and Sooke) at 1100hrs this morning. A Minke was breaching on the N. side of Spieden Ch. at 1545 only seen from a distance but at least 5 breaches.

Hi Susan and Howie, 
<br/>I wanted to report my first sighting ever of a lone gray whale. My husband and I was at the Edmonds beach where the waterpark is on Saturday May 11. I was eating lunch enjoying the peaceful view of the mountains droppng down into the water when my husband came up to the car and said he saw a whale. I watched to see what he thought was a whale and sure enough the creature resurfaced with a great blow and covered in barnicles. I only wondered at that moment if there were any divers around the park and sure enough I saw two surface and start kicking inland as fast as they possibly could. Now, I'm not sure if they actually saw the gray but only know that that would be my reaction as close as they seemed to be. 
Feeling so fortunate to have witnessed such a beautiful sight on such a beautiful day.....

Hi 
<br/>A very odd day, was in Spieden Ch. when info came in about transients east of Race Rocks. Before this at 1052 had the greatest number of Dall's posrpoise in 15+ years of observation's just E. of Kelp Reef, I mean 500+. 
We ran to an area S. of Victoria and found T10,T10A and the third whale which I think was named at T10B at 1304. 
We went S.E. in the afternoon to T14 who was 13miles S.E. of Victoria found him at 1510hrs. After that on to Race Rocks were I found 15+ El Seals all female or juveniles.

Hi Susan and Howie,
<br/>We had transients heading north in Andrews Bay this afternoon (west side of San Juan Island). At about 1620 they passed right by the reef. Present were T10, T10b, T10c(?), T18, T19, T19b, and T19c(?). I'll have to check with Graeme about the "c"'s to make sure one of them is not a "d". Ken and I had an encounter with them in the whaler as they traveled and milled deep into Mitchell Bay, past the mouth of Open Bay, and along the rocks at Kellett Bluff. We left them travelling northwest about 1/2 mile west of north Kellett Bluff around 1730. We heard that these whales had been at Race Rocks earlier in the day and T14 had been seen too.

Hi- Just enjoyed 2 gray whales feeding vigorously, close together, just south of Mabana (4 pm). Lots of laying on their sides with fluke and tail fin vertical in the air. One looked smaller, so may have been Mom and baby. Also thought I heard them last evening but couldn't find them, but this morning with the tide out, there were fresh feeding holes on the tide flats.

The OVAL hydrophone array recorded spectacular vocalizations and 
echolocation clicks this morning around 7:30 am as J pod passed southbound in Haro Strait about 250 m offshore of Smugglers Cove, San Juan Island. The sea was quiet and no boats were present so the sounds were ethereal!

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reports one Transient in Baynes Channel this morning, and parts of J pod this afternoon. At 2 pm they were near Iceburg Pt, and moved northwest up to the west side of San Juan Island, turning around and heading south at Pile Pt.

Hi Susan! I'm sure that there will be other J Pod reports today, however, this is the first time that we found them without the help of my whale watching friends! We were on our boat on the south side of Lopez and accidentally floated upon five or six of them feeding and putting on quite a show, at around 1:30p.m. As our friends from Island Adventures led us toward Iceberg Point, there were at least seven whales with us, but I'm still an amateur at identifying! I did see J17 and her daughters. We stayed with them until about 3:15 and left for Friday Harbor as they moved past Cattle Point. It was an amazing day for us newcomers!

Hi Susan...John (Ford) and I were out to see L98 on May 7 and he looked to be in good shape and appears to have grown a foot over the winter! J pod was by Nanaimo on the evening of May 8. Cheers,

Hi, We saw 3 or 4 grey whales about a hundred yards out from the Clinton ferry dock this morning (May 5) at 8:30. They were headed South. Two of them spouted almost simultaneously and very close together making us wonder if it wasn't a mother and her calf.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reported a pod of orcas in Obstruction Pass (off Orcas Island) Sunday at 1pm, headed south.
<br/>*<br/>
Chuck Poust called from the Windjammer Gallery in Coupeville to report one gray whale headed into Penn Cove at 8:30 am.
<br/>*<br/>
A single transient (T61?) reported off Cowichan Head at 1200 and T14 of Cadboro Pt. (the N.E. corner of Baynes Ch, southeast Vancouver Island) at 1220. 
The times and distance would indicate 2 whales.

At 10:21 we spotted two grays here in the Saratoga Passage, just moving slowly and enjoying the "gray" day here in Washington. They are rolling around right off Sandy Point and heading towards Clinton.

T14 and T61 around Trial Island this morning both went N. through Oak Bay (Vancouver Island, near Victoria), T14 kept on N. T61 started to wander. 
Left him at Beaumont Shoals going S.E. at 1530. 
No late report on T14.

3 pm - We received a call of 4 - 5 orcas in Penn Cove, off Coupeville, Whidbey Island. The caller saw 3 big fins, then saw two others spouting. She said they were in the middle of the cove traveling south - we're headed to Seattle for tonight's Snake River Salmon presentation, but hope to get a chance to look out on the water before we leave &amp; see if we see any fins....

Left Jpod going N. in Andrews Bay (San Juan Island) at 1545. 
 The Stellar may be a female, as usual must wait for photos but had one there 2 years ago.

Two gray whales off East Point (Whidbey Is.) on the evening 1 May. I identified both as being animals we have seen since the early 1990s. ID-49 or Patch has a large white depigmented area behind the dorsal hump predominantly on the right side although a small amount is visible from the left. The other ID-53 is also fairly distinctive with a smaller oval white depigmented area on the L side. These two were joined by a third whale just at dark, which I could not positively identify in the field. Given the low disappearing light I had to approach these closer than I normally try to do in order to 
confirm ID and obtain photographs. I was in a small white inflatable boat, in case anyone was watching and curious who I was.
