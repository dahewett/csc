I am losing them in the distance, I'm heading home.  
<br/><b>09:38 -</b> Found the orcas off <b>Presidents Point</b> steady northbound towards Kingston. West side of mid channel. <b>At least 7-8 including adult male and little one</b> (looking good for same Ts as yesterday: 36, 36Bs, 137s) but, too distant to confirm IDs from across the Sound, I am at Kayu Kayu Ac Park in Richmond Beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Thu Jan 31 - That is so exciting! Luv It! The <b>humpback off Edmonds. was around 3:45 p.m.</b> I am so surprised she came so close and inside of the scuba diving park and disappeared just before the ferry landing. -Ginger McMillian
<br/>(<i>Video reviewed confirmed <b>humpback off Edmonds waterfront</b>, presumabley same whale reported in Possession Sound in our last Whale Report - alb</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Thu Jan 31 - <b>14:00 - </b>I spotted a <b>humpback</b> next to shore(!) at <b>Mukilteo Lighthouse</b>, heading south and away from shore, away from Lighthouse. I'm so glad it graced me, I was looking northbound for orcas and would've missed it had it not spouted directly behind me! -Alex Ho
<br/>(<i>Video sent to us by Alex shows <b>humpback</b> very close to dock pilings, diving, did not present fluke. Frame grab below - alb</i>) 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:43 - Humpack in Everett</b>. While conducting sediment research with ORCA students and Gravity Marine, a humpback surfaced off our starboard side and swam under the boat at 12:43, surfacing on the port side and headed towards the Naval base. Though we all have mental pictures (since our hands were full of equipment) you'll have to trust me that it was a juvenile humpback (and not a gray). -Ardi Kveven, Executive Director, ORCA

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - <b>L pod -</b> Canadian side of Haro Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait:...All the whales we could see were heading southerly toward <b>Beaumont Shoal and Seabird Point on Discovery Island</b>. The first whale we saw was <b>L115</b> before we moved to a distant small group that included <b>L72, L105, L90, and L103</b>. So, we had at least the group of <b>18 L pod whales that included the L4, L47, and L72 matrilines plus L90</b>. Since the other whales were so sparse and hard to find, plus the lack of any males larger than L105, it made us suspect that these 18 Ls were the only residents here...Full summary with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 6.<b>L90 and L105</b> - Part of <b>L pod came down from the north through Haro Strait and headed west</b>.

This VIDEO (is beautiful, have a listen to their exhalations - alb) was taken at 11:52am Wednesday from <b>Chambers Bay Park</b> in University Place. I think there were <b>4 adults and 1 baby</b>. It was magical! -Paula White Young  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<br/><b>10:24 orcas </b>spotted at the north end of <b>Salmon Beach</b>, close to east side. I'm viewing from old Ferry Landing in Gig Harbor. Came to scout for the humpback and spotted 3-4 quick blows &amp; dorsals instead. Not great visibility with the fog but can see across the sound well enough. They are heading south, at least 3. -Heidi Armstrong

HUMPBACK WHALES - Wed Jan 30 - <b>14:55 -  Pier 70; Large whale</b> unsure of what type, blows RIGHT UNDER PIER. Headed north. Our guess was Humpback. -Theresa Rivkin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Here are some very poor photos (below and not so poor -alb) of yesterday's <b>humpback encounter in Seattle </b>just in case you want them as a record. Around <b>14:30</b>, happened to see him/her cruise by quite close to shore <b>along Alki Ave heading towards Elliott Bay</b> just below the surface. Was traveling quite fast all the way across Elliott Bay towards the ferry terminal, those in West Seattle lost sight. Noticed the Argosy boat headed straight towards it and they both appeared to go down one if the port channels. Never saw it after that. Waited about an hour &amp; saw the boat head back to the dock but did not see the whale head back into the bay. Hope this is helpful for your records. Thanks for the work that you do to support our whale populations! -Sharon Wada

<b>11:43 - </b>Spotted single whale close to shore. South side of <b>Three Tree Point (near 2600 block SW 172nd, Burien</b>) heading north....Amazing!!! S/he was super close to shore though. Between buoys and shoreline, so have no doubt it was a whale....Didn't see dorsal fin clearly. Color grayish. Not an orca. Also moved like other <b>humpbacks</b> I've seen up north. -Sandhya Ballai

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>08:15 - Humpback</b> spotted off <b>Ruston Way in Tacoma</b> head towards Point Ruston. (Westbound). -Julie Martin

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b> 

DOLPHINS - Wed Jan 30 - <b>17:35 -</b> Heading slowly back toward<b> Alki Point</b> after sunset.
<br/><b>17:00 -</b> Just spotted <b>2 dolphins heading south from Emma Schmitz Viewpoint</b>, looks like they are angling toward Lowman Beach. I wonder if the bottlenose that has been seen around lately has been joined by a friend? (Light conditions prevent positive species ID, though, so I'm not sure they were bottlenose.) -Stephanie Raymond

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Wed Jan 30 - There were a bunch of <b>porpoises </b>on Wednesday in <b>Saratoga Passage between Penn Cove and Madrona on Camano</b>, closer to the Camano side. Do you guys want to know when I see them? I see them a lot out here. -Wendy Nelson

BIGGS/TRANSIENTS - Tue Jan 29 - A large <b>pod of orcas, 7 or so</b>, passed our sail boat. The sighting happened at 3:30 pm heading south bound in <b>Rosario Strait just west of Burrows island</b>. There was definitely a juvenile among them. -Elena Sera Jones
<br/>(<i>ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, CWR: "best I can say is that they are transients.  I don't know that left whale off the top of my head and it wasn't who I thought it might be." Melisa Pinnow, CWR wasn't sure who they were either.</i>)

<b>13:30. </b>Whale turned around in Gull Harbor and then traveled up the eastern shore - very close to shore - passing Boston Harbor Marina. It then crossed across the bay heading west toward Hunter Point. I have lost sight - but not sound - of its blows. Slow, rolling surfacing series. Some longer dives than others. I never saw a fluke. Very robust blows.
<br/><b>12:40. Humpback </b>is still in <b>Budd Inlet</b>. It is now on the eastern shore in Gull Harbor. Gull Harbor is in the distance (behind the blow/whale) in the above photo.
<br/><b>11:15 - Humpback</b> heading south into<b> Budd Inlet</b> - passing the tip of Cooper Point and on the western shore. Traveling at a slow, surfacing series, pace. This is the last image I have of it (taken from my deck) as it crossed the bay into Eld Inlet heading west toward Hunter Point. That is the southern end of Harstine Island in the background. -Kim Merriman
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>08:17 - Large whale in front of Sunny Side Beach, Steilacoom</b> heading south...He was very close to shore. Dorsal was pointed back and he was huge. -Lisa Wiksten

Heading south...I assumed Gray whale but honestly cannot be certain. We have seen humpback whales in the past but they were in groups and they were jumping which made them easy to identify as we have seen them in Hawaii. This was a solitary whale with not much coming out of the water as it moved its way along which is more similar to what I have seen of gray whales in the past.Thanks for your work with all the whales! -Walt Spady

MINKE WHALES - Sat Jan 23 - <b>A Minke Whale visited Elger Bay</b> the morning of January 23, about two hundred yards from our house. The house is high bank waterfront, up 80 some feet, always good for Whale Watching. It was here from<b> 6 am to about 9 or ten</b>....
I knew right away that it was not a Grey Whale. We see them every year. I looked in my Marine Wildlife book by Steve Yates. Orca, Grey and Minke. The Minke is very distinctive, very streamlined, certainly beautiful....Occasionally it rested on the surface, looking rather like a log. And that's what Sally thought it was until it started to swim. The tide may have something do all this. A 13 foot tide floats the logs off the beach.I must say this is one my favorite naturalist experiences. I was once a Park Ranger/Naturalist for City of Bellevue,WA. I personally know that this sighting is true. Behavior definitely not Grey Whale. We see  them  every year. It was in front of house for hours, generally about no more than 200 to 300 yards away. Definitely a Minke Whale. -Jared Robinson

It's always a beautiful day when you see whales, but considering it's only January today was exceptional with calm seas and warm sunshine prevailing as members of the Southern Resident community edged north in Admiralty Inlet after an early start bringing the <b>Mukilteo/Clinton ferry</b> to a halt earlier this morning, a welcome diversion for commuters. Although many of the whales had already passed Possession boat ramp when we arrived, the trailers were closer to the Whidbey side giving us early birds a breakfast boost as they streamed by in singles, doubles and more. It was over all too soon, so those of us who can never get enough of orca encounters kept track of the whales as they entered Admiralty Inlet, waiting patiently at Bush Point for their arrival. Although we cannot be sure who exactly was there,<b> J27 (Blackberry)</b> was recognized and there were rumors of a calf, so perhaps some L pod whales were also present (<i>no new calf or Ls were documented, presumably calf seen was J53 Kiki - alb</i>). One thing's for sure, yet again we were privileged to see these charismatic creatures, the sight of which serves only to increase our determination that we do all we can to ensure they survive. -Sandra Pollard

Friend and neighbor Danielle posts on Orca Network this morning that <b>orcas at the ferry around 7:45 AM.</b> Put on boots and coat and head out. Pick up Danielle to get to <b>Glendale Beach</b>. Took a while for them to get down there and they had crossed Possession Sound and were much <b>closer to the mainland</b> side of the channel than the Whidbey side but an hour later orcas were STILL passing by. Expecting to head out and spend a few moments seeing a small family of Bigg's orcas, it became obvious as we started getting better looks at sheer number, behavior and dorsals that we had Southern Residents even though I didn't see any open saddles. I'm pretty sure I saw Blackberry, Princess Angeline and Kiki for sure. <b>I think all of J Pod present because we probably saw 20 whales.</b> Then we headed down to Possession where we caught up with Dori, Rachel and Durand and saw the trailers foraging. Finally a quick stop at Scatchet Head where I saw one very, very distant breach. Wow - J Pod not even on my radar when I woke up this morning even though it did feel like an orca day. 
<br/><b>10:11 -</b> viewing trailers from <b>Scatchet Head</b> waaayyy in the distance still <b>heading south</b>. Saw one breach.
<br/><b>09:39 -</b> still have some midchannel <b>Possession heading south but also foraging. J Pod!</b>

<b>Orcas</b> were announced by the Ferry captain as we waited to depart the <b>Clinton</b> terminal this morning at <b>8am</b>.

Sun Jan 20 - <b>15:06 - Gray whale</b> just passed <b>Pebble Beach</b> heading north. Close to shore. With all the wave chop today it was hard to spot the gray as it swam by.

South Puget Sound - Seen on Gig Harbor Town talk at <b>1pm</b>: "A small pod of <b>orcas just came out of the burley lagoon </b>head out here in Purdy! Just a heads up if any of you are around the area. Keep a look out! Catch some pictures if ya can. I was too slow to shoot some pictures" We look out on Henderson Bay from high up, so I will look now with binoculars, though it's super choppy, so wish me luck! -Cora Reuter Foster

Thu Jan 17 - North Puget Sound - I was starting to get seriously concerned about my whale karma after failing to see any whales so far in 2019, despite a number of visits by both residents and transients to Puget Sound. It can start to get to you... After staking out Brighton Beach, Sandy Point and Langley following reports of whales heading into Saratoga Passage earlier (and along with Marilyn Armbruster seeing nothing) we made a last ditch attempt to spot them from <b>Fox Spit at around 3:30 pm</b>. Success! Initially it was a fleeting glimpse of a disappearing dorsal fin, but soon a tight group of <b>four/five orcas</b> surfaced mid-channel, including a calf (who I'm calling Dinky). With both wind and waves increasing, two of the whales turned southwards, milling briefly for a while, before the group picked up the pace and resumed their travels north in the company of an adult male. I feel much better now. <b>Members of the T137s, T36, T36Bs in Saratoga Passage.</b> -Sandra Pollard. Photos Richard Snowberger.
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>15:54 -</b> One adult male with the group. We reckon <b>five Orcas</b>. Still slowly northbound mid channel. Sea and wind both picking up now.
<br/><b>15:45 - Look like transients</b>. At least four including dinky calf. Grouped up and slowly northbound. Appear to be in hunting mode.
<br/><b>15.30 - Orcas </b>passing <b>Fox Spit</b> mid channel northbound. Not sure how many yet. Brief sighting. -Sandra Pollard

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>14:40 - A pod of Orcas</b> are heading north towards Langley from <b>Sandy Point</b>. I spotted them off my house. -Debra Rack

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:15 - Orcas </b>seen from port side of <b>Clinton to Mukilteo ferry</b> crossing, seem to be heading west toward Whidbey. They were between the ferry lanes and Hat Island. -Sharon Harper-Peck

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:12 - Orcas. </b>Got them! Mid channel between the <b>WSF lane and Hat (Island)</b>. Heading toward Saratoga. Looked like the baby was with them. Too far to get ID. -Allie Hudec

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:10 pm -</b> Nancy Boyle reports a pod of <b>5-6 orcas off Glendale Beach</b>, S.Whidbey/Possession Sound, headed north toward the Clinton ferry dock. At least one adult male, several smaller orcas.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>09:08 - Orcas at Double Bluff</b>. Stopped via the clipper possible L pod. Few people seen a little one in the group. Pretty spread out. Seen one turn. Wanted to show me its belly. They were just playing in a circle looks like they were bumping into each other. -Nikky Benn aboard the Victoria Clipper

I was told by a construction worker on site here, that <b>"about three orcas"</b> passed by close to shore during the <b>late afternoon</b>, heading south. This location is about <b>.75 miles south of the Fauntleroy Ferry Dock</b>. The number and proximity of the orcas is consistent with transients. -Jim Nunn

Last hour of the daylight spent at <b>Fox Spit</b> after spending all day searching for them, was headed to our destination sunset on west side when had heard the orcas were finally spotted on east side mid <b>Saratoga Passage</b> headed north. rushed back to the Passage and spent an incredible late afternoon/early evening last hour of daylight with the <b>T137s from Fox Spit</b>...waters, colors, glassy,calm, reflective, patterns, lines, textures, snowcaps...amazing!

At <b>16:00</b> we pulled up to bluff at <b>Bell's Beach</b> and see orcas strait out heading northbound passing Whidbey side mid channel. We immediately headed over to <b>Fox Spit and by 16:20</b> relocated the females/young to the south making directional changes in beautiful calm glassy seas. A few minutes later, approx. 16:25, we found <b>T137A</b> north and east of the others out toward mid channel ever so slowly wending his way towards us while the females/young were still further south milling around and disappearing on longer dives. We (Marilyn, I and group of hardy folks having a picnic in the freezing cold) were watching T137A when suddenly the rest of the <b>T137s</b> surfaced right off the spit at <b>16:30. T137 w/T137D </b>by her side surfaced very close inshore and <b>T137B</b> was few hundred feet out from them. T137A maintained his slow steady course further out and now trailing his family. AS they passed T137, T137D veered towards Baby Island, as T137 cleared the spit few minutes behind at 16:35. By 16:40 all were to the NW of us so we relocated to the Baby Island area and watched them briefly stalled out <b>between Fox Spit and Baby Island</b> before grouping up now more mid channel where they continued northbound very slowly. Sublime setting, perfectly Glassy calm seas, gorgeous sundown colors &amp; lighting, vivid white snow-capped mountains. Perfect ending to a day of searching for orcas and taking in all the wonders including the two most excellent adorable sweet donkeys. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b>~11:00 -</b> I was viewing from the north end ferry boat as it was headed away from <b>Vashon towards Fauntleroy</b>. Saw one male leader quickly headed south down the east end of the island, then a pod of 5-6 or so bunched up, about a mile or so behind headed south as well.

K pod - Ken called Dave at home in the early afternoon to report that he was seeing whales heading south a little north of Beaumont Shoal. Since the whales were reported to be <b>K pod</b>, Dave grabbed his gear, headed for Snug Harbor, and left in "Orcinus" at <b>1455</b>. Dave arrived on scene about a half mile south of Trial Island at 1530. The whales were very spread out and traveling slowly west. <b>K21 and the K20s</b> were the first whales encountered...While <b>K25</b> did not look 100% healthy, neither did it look like his health worsened much since we last received really good photos of him from October 12th. It is too early to say whether he will survive this latest health scare but it is encouraging that he has not deteriorated further since looking pretty bad back in September and may have actually improved some. Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 3.

Sorry, I was unable to get any pictures. We ended up watching them for about 1.5 hours because they were so spread out, probably about 16 of them in total. 2 were moving quite slowly and were fairly far off from the rest of the pod, we watched them resting at the surface for some time so I wondered if that was J17.
<br/><b>11:16 - </b>looks like a few more still coming through. I'll try to get pictures!

<b>10:00 -</b> We live on he bluff at <b>Tulalip</b> and have been watching a single <b>small gray whale</b> feeding in the shallow water beyond <b>Jetty Island</b> on a daily basis all fall and winter. While I haven't been able to get a picture to identify it, I assume it is a stray juvenile. A few minutes ago we were watching a spout and a second larger spout appeared, then a third. I can't identify any of them yet, but the timing suggests the return of the sounders....They were near our house in shallow water showing their backs - no dorsal fins. Everything is weird as far as whales are concerned. I spent last week participating in whale week on the Oregon coast. I haven't seen the numbers, but the southern migration was the smallest at that point that I have seen in decades. I would see a half dozen a day. In other years we would see up to 40 or so. I did see a juvenile humpback from a boat (we were looking for grays)  in close to shore north of Newport. The frequency of seeing humpbacks, both in the sound and offshore, is a relatively new phenomenon. The regular appearance of grays is also somewhat new, 25 years or so. I first encountered whales as a teenager in 1960; a pod of orca surrounded the rowboat I was in. I have been on the watch for them since then. -Curt Johnson

<b>10:00 -</b> Morning! I've got <b>2 baleen whale blows</b> in my view. There's a bunch of activity associated with a bait ball bringing in a bunch of birds and a few pinnipeds.

Both are visible at the same time through my binoculars but they're not together. 1/12/2019. -Amy Willoughby

SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - ..."Morning Star" spotted blows at the <b>northern end of Admiralty Inlet at 0930</b>, about a mile northeast of Point Wilson. It was <b>all of K pod</b> sleepily traveling northwest in a tight group. Everyone was accounted for, <b>including K25</b>. K25 remains thin, but it appears that his condition has not worsened. It wasn't long until more blows were seen a few hundred yards behind K pod. It was <b>all of L pod</b> grouped up and also slowly heading northwest. "Morning Star" moved from K pod to L pod to find the new calf. All of L pod was accounted for and <b>L77's new calf, L124, was confirmed at 0950</b>. The calf appeared to be about 3 weeks old and was bouncing around <b>between L25, L41, L77 L85, and L119</b>. A gender was not revealed during the encounter but there will hopefully be more opportunities in the future....Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 2.

Fri Jan 11 - Juan de Fuca Strait - There's not a whole lot we can say about days like today because words really don't do them justice. Watching all of the Southern Resident killer whales come together to socialize and play was a beautiful thing to witness, even more so because we couldn't help but feel like they were celebrating the arrival of the newest member of their community---<b>L124</b>. Days like these inspire us to carry on in our fight to protect these whales and remind us to cherish every, single moment. -Maya's Legacy WW

About <b>9:15 this morning</b>, arrived at the <b>Camano Island SP </b>beach area to walk dogs. Walked SE through parking area and as we got to the beach trail, heard some blows by the kelp beds that wrap around into <b>Elger Bay</b>. Thought it might be porpoise but then saw a very tall dorsal fin and several other smaller ones, but definitely bigger than porpoise. The pod was swimming NW along the beach, so we walked on the beach trail a bit behind them to observe. Looked like <b>one big healthy male and 2 very small ones and about 5 or so others of varying sizes</b> in between. The 2 babies were staying close to their moms. Now and then the male turned perpendicular to the group and did some shallow dives. They moved as either a bunched group or fanned out until their noses lined up. They moved rapidly NW in the middle of Saratoga Passage using long dives interspersed with shallow surface dives. It all took about 10 minutes before they were out of sight. No one else was at the beach, although one small boat launched and headed right over the top of where they had just gone down for a long dive. Don't think that boater saw them. -Jeanne Johnson

UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Fri Jan 11 - Not sure what I saw, but <b>two whales, in Hood Canal</b>. On the east side of the canal. Very odd because Killer Whales used to go up and down on the other side of the canal, near Shine (I used to watch them all the time!), but this was odd because they were on this side (the east side) AND, they were a light muddy brown colour, kinda like if you had a light tan. Just a couple of undulating humps. No big dorsal fin, so I'm sure these weren't Killer Whales, but what were they? I was thinking Sea Lions, which is also a bit unusual, because we have Harbour Seals out here, but not many Sea Lions, but thinking back, they were very large for Sea Lions.
This was in the late morning, a couple of days ago. Heading north, about a 1/2 mile from the bridge...
thanks for the chart. <b>That pic of the Sea Lion is exactly the colour</b> of what I saw, but all I saw were slow moving "lumps" in the water, so, hard to judge size. Its weird because I'm used to seeing them 2 miles away, on the other side of the canal. The feeling I have is that they were larger than a Killer Whale (based mostly on how slow they were moving. I remember Killer Whales were a bit more energetic in their movements)...<b>maybe that Minke Whale?</b>...but tan coloured, like the pic of the Sea Lion. Sorry I can't be of more help. -Dean Seaman

Happy Friday - We viewed a pod of<b> Orcas from Ruston Point in Tacoma </b>yesterday, Jan 10. We were looking towards Vashon. They were traveling from the direction of the point toward the port. And then turned back the other direction. This was mid-day <b>between 2 and 3pm.</b> Not sure of total, but more than 5 for sure. My guess would be 8 or 9. Only able to capture a cell phone video of one group. They were quite a ways out. -Thank you, Stefanie Holland

UNCONFIRMED WHALES - Mon Jan 7 - There was a single <b>humpback</b> whale, seemed small maybe a juvenile, traveling from mid channel between Hat Island and Whidbey Island.  It headed towards the east side of Whidbey. It took about a half hour to cross the channel from 10:30am to 11:00am this morning 1-7-10....I was pretty high up on a cliff but had binoculars. In the lighting it looked dark almost black with a bump at the top of the head and another bump farther down on the top of the spine. I looked it up and it seemed to be a humpback, but I am not experienced so<b> maybe it was a gray</b>. I had seen a gray last spring going to the same feeding area. -Jennifer Wetmore

<b>13:07 -</b> We saw them on our down south in the boat today...we were<b> between Key Peninsula and Anderson Island</b>. They were headed north, but once they passed us it looked like they turned around. Then we lost sight of them. This video was taken at 1:07pm today.  Maybe this helps. Cheers! -Kathryn Boender

<b>16:18 - Orcas </b>are in front of <b>Point Ruston</b> now. -Patricia Reynolds

<b>~16:00 - I saw 4-5 orcas</b> at about 4 PM at the mouth of <b>commencement bay</b>. They were between point Ruston and the browns head lighthouse milling more towards the lighthouse. They appeared to be slowly moving north north west. My coworker in the area saw them earlier in the day (first spotted 2:30 or 3) along the northern edge of commencement bay. We both saw tail lobbing and some breaching. We don't know if they were residents or transients and they were too far to see saddle patches. -Cheers, Erin Stehr

<b>15:45 - Group of Orcas</b> killing a porpoise in front of <b>Browns point lighthouse</b>, I think it's a porpoise anyways. -Patricia Reynolds

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>13:30 - Orca in East Passage</b> approaching from the north about 500m off <b>Dash Point Pier</b>. The would come up as a group for a few seconds and the moving fast resurface further south. They had rounded Dash Point heading towards the Browns Point light by 1:45. I completely failed on pictures. Estimate about 6 animals. Looked like at least 2 calfs and 1 tall male dorsal. Moving fast. -Eric Elgar

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Wed Jan 2 - I saw <b>two orcas this morning at about 7:45 slightly south of Richmond Beach in Shoreline</b>. They were hanging out pretty close to the shore, not heading in any particular direction....I was only a hundred or so feet away and had clear view of the dorsals which I'd say were closer to 3 feet in height, but I didn't see their backs at all so it's possible they were partially submerged. It looked like the dorsals were about the same size, though I believe one was slightly smaller than the other....What I saw were smooth and black without any ridges along the edge. They were moving around kind of back and forth, just not on a mission to get anywhere. -Thank you, Katie Wilson 
<br/>(<i>after discussion of <b>possibly sea lions</b> Katie still think she saw orcas - alb</i>)
