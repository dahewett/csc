<br/><br/>
<b>J pod</b> was encountered just north of <b>Lime Kiln Lighthouse</b> (48° 31.298 N; 123° 09.804 W) spread out traveling south at <b>10:43 a.m</b> by Center for Whale Research staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah. Whales were spread from shore to mid strait. A lot of milling, foraging and surface activity was observed. The whales turned west off South Beach (48° 26.42 N; 123° 00.68 W) where the encounter ended at <b>2:03 p.m.</b> J's later turned around and headed back up island.

Orca Network received a message from Brenden Sams relaying a report of <b>orcas </b>in <b>Humboldt Co, CA</b> for the last 2 days. He left no details but said he had photos, we will forward on any further info. or photos as they come in. 
<br/>*<br/>
We spent a delightful day with <b>J Pod</b> in the <b>afternoon and evening</b>. We left them headed north at <b>7:00 PM</b> at <b>Limekiln</b>, and later in the evening heard them near Mitchell Pt. on the northwest side of San Juan Island.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
We got word that the <b>Orcas </b>were near <b>False Bay</b> and heading up island. We rushed over there and immediately were able to identify<b> J-1, "Ruffles"</b>, we then saw granny, Riptide, Sachi and a few others. We were so excited, J-pod twice in a row! It's always so amazing to see Granny; she is estimated to be 98 years old and the matriarch of J-pod. We watched J-pod as they cruised with the current toward <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b>. They traveled very close together for a while, and then spread out a little. On our afternoon adventure we saw J-30, Riptide, along with other J-pod members. Riptide was born in 1995 and is the eldest surviving offspring of J-14, Samish. He is maturing into an adult and is growing a very tall dorsal fin. We watched as he fished, very interesting, you can see how quickly he is capable of moving. We also saw lots and lots of spy hopping. On the way back to Friday Harbor on our afternoon trip we were looking at all the sea birds, mostly gulls, congregating in one spot on the ocean surface. This is a sure sign of 'fish'. The birds were making lots of noise and sure enough we saw a <b>Minke whale</b>. Minke whales are one of the smallest baleen whales. We watched for a few minutes and another minke surfaced, but this one was much smaller, one of the Captains named him "Twinkie". "Twinkie" the baby minke
<br/>Naturalist Jeannette Miller, Crew At San Juan Safaris Whale Watch Wildlife Tours 
<br/>*<br/>
We had word that <b>J Pod</b> was also down south of the island! The kids were thrilled when they got to witness <b>J1 Ruffles</b> just poking along about 1 mile offshore from <b>Lime Kiln</b>. We also watched J2 Granny just in front of Ruffles, and the kids got a laugh out of the fact that Ruffles is a big "momma's boy" who stays pretty close to her for most of his life. We left the whales around <b>1045 </b>. For our afternoon trip, we went to visit the <b>orcas </b>again, who were doing the classic "west side shuffle" between <b>Lime Kiln and Eagle Point (1300)</b>. The whales were following the shoreline pretty closely, and as we watched from nearly 1/2 mile from shore, everyone aboard was asking great questions about whale behaviors. We had <b>J22 Oreo</b> and her boy <b>J34 Doublestuff</b> a bit further away from the main group, and they seemed to be doing some fishing based on their multiple direction changes. And then Doublestuff literally erupted from the water doing two huge breaches in a row. He sure is getting to be big at only 11 years of age! Then the group of inshore whales decided to follow his lead and did several breaches, tailslaps, and spyhops as well. We headed back down to Salmon Bank, as the kids were going to do an experiment collecting plankton. But imagine our surprise as we floated silently in the water while making the collection to have the same very small minke whale from yesterday surface very close to the boat! He must have been down on a long dive as we had last seen him over 800 yards away from the boat in his prior surfacing. One of the kids noted he must be eating some of the same stuff they were trying to collect! We watched for a few minutes longer as we watched the minke proceed to a baitball and scatter all the birds as he "stole" his meal from them.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:30am</b> - <b>Resident orcas</b> observed from shore at Smallpox Bay on <b>San Juan Island</b>. Several male dorsal fins were visible, as well as open saddle patches, as the pod traveled Southbound. One orca exhibited two fluke slaps, and another changed direction for a short time. All continued South, and were again observed at Dead Man's Bay.
<br/>Jason Sneed, Marine Naturalist
<br/>*<br/>
This morning (<b>10:05 am</b>) we have <b>J Pod</b> heading north on the west side of <b>SJI </b>near <b>Hanna Heights</b>. There are whales coming in from the direction of Hein Bank, not sure if this is J Pod or others - details to follow!

<br/><br/>
Reports were of <b>L's</b> off <b>Salmon Bank</b>, when we got out there at about <b>2:15pm</b>, there were many whales, at first appearing to forage with the minor ebb tide, then the orcas all came together heading toward the west. There were so many we wondered that there were more than L's. Sure enough some K's were with them as they went on a long dive, and surfaced northwest toward Eagle Cove. Another group of orcas approached from the southeast, looking like they were going to join the first big group, did a few tail lobs, then turned back to the west. The large group then turned and all the whales were joining up and speed swimming! toward the west when we left them at about <b>3:25pm</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from John Barino of the Olympic Coast NMS - his family observed <b>3 - 4 orcas</b> including a young one from the Coho ferry (Victoria to Pt. Angeles) at <b>9 oclock</b>. We're assuming they may have been K or L pod whales, as they were seen heading out west that evening.
<br/>*<br/>
Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah departed Snug Harbor and encountered <b>K's and Ls</b> traveling south past<b> Open Bay</b> (48° 33.818 N; 123° 11.560 W) at 11:43 a.m. The whales were spread out along the west side of San Juan Island. At around 2:30 p.m. several L's grouped up and turned west toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca (48° 21.930 N; 123° 05.030 W). K's and L's continued traveling west spread out in groups.

<br/>*<br/>
We spotted two <b>minke </b>whales amongst the multiple bait balls forming at <b>Salmon Bank</b> (one of the minkes is the smallest I've ever seen, so perhaps it's a new calf?).
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
In big seas, we followed the <b>Ks and the Ls</b> that were headed West about 7 miles south of <b>Victoria</b>. The <b>Js </b>went North from <b>Turn Pt.</b> and I would think that we would see them today.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside
<br/>*<br/>
When we approached <b>Salmon Bank</b> south of the island, we could see a few boats in the distance, which was encouraging (<b>1315</b>). Soon we found our own little group of <b>orcas </b>to watch, and it was so thrilling to see how active the whales were. I couldn't ID one of the orcas that must have breached almost a dozen times in about 10 minutes as he was a bit far away. But we had no problems making an ID of <b>L41 Mega, L79 Skana, L88 Wavewalker</b>. These big boys have huge dorsal fins, which is also why we call them indicator whales (since these whales live with mom all their lives, if they are around, you know mom isn't too far away!) Soon our three "big boys" were joined by other members of their family. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>K's</b> were milling off <b>Pile Point</b> around <b>9:30 a.m.</b> (probably earlier). Soon word was out that many whales were coming down from the north. Some of the K's went north to meet them. The whales coming south turned out to be many <b>L pod</b> whales. They swept the strait around noon as they came south on this beautiful day. Quite a sight--so many tall (male) fins! I heard people identify the L12's, L2's and L7's. The Center was out much of the day so they will be able to tell us if it was all of the L's. 
As I write this (6:27 pm) the J's are reportedly up north perhaps near the coal docks. L's and K's are heading west. Hope they come back soon.
<br/>Sharon Grace, San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/>
We heard some calls at about <b>12:05</b> on the <b>Lime Kiln Hydrophone</b> - so great to be able to listen to the whales even though we can't see them.
<br/>Susan Berta &amp; Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11 am</b>: Hearing a few SRKW calls (mostly S19s?) with nice "reverb" at <b>OrcaSound </b>hydrophones.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach 
<br/>*<br/>
There are a few Orcas, probably <b>L12,L-85,L-22, L-79 and L-89</b> down near <b>Eagle Pt</b>, San Juan Island right now (<b>8:20 am</b>). 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Arlene Sullivan on Mayne Island,BC, reporting a pod of<b> ~10 orcas</b> including 2 males heading NE through <b>Active Pass</b>, just traveling, not stopping to feed, at <b>1:20 pm</b>
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>0625 </b>a few <b>orcas </b>passed <b>Point Roberts</b> heading Southeast. They were difficult to identify due to frigid strong winds whipping up 4 foot waves. They were just travelling through with scarce surfacings then long dives. It is possible that these were the trailers since I'm quite sure that there was a breach and some blows off in the distant rough waters earlier this morning.
<br/>Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce, Pt. Roberts 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Dave from Island Packers, on the Islander out of <b>Ventura, CA</b> - reporting ~ <b>5-8 orcas</b> at 34 05.15N, 119 29.13W. The pod included 1 sprouter male, 1 adult female and several juveniles &amp; sub-adults. 
<br/>*<br/>
We continue to see the <b>minke </b>whale (again this morning) at the mouth of aleck bay, between swirl island and hughes bay, south end of <b>lopez</b>. It is there many mornings.
<br/>Sheila Bishop, Lopez Island 
<br/><br/>
<b>June 28, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered <b>J pod</b> <b>early morning</b> off the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. Later in the day Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah encountered <b>K and L pods</b> travelling in loose groups up Swanson Channel (48° 42.939 N; 123° 15.980 W) at <b>12:30 p.m</b>. At 1:37 p.m. the last group passed Mouat Point on North Pender Island B.C. and continued travelling north up Active Pass. At <b>2:15 p.m.</b> the<b> L2's</b> were encountered just off Spieden Channel (48° 33.112 N; 123° 11.521W). They were spread out travelling south.

<br/>*<br/>
So. Resident <b>Orcas </b>- West side of <b>Stuart Island</b>.
<br/>Bart Holman 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>heading towards the Westshore<b> coal docks</b> to the Fraser River at approx. <b>1600</b>. They were quite active with some breaching as they pass the South Arm of the Fraser at approx. <b>1800</b>.
<br/>Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce, Pt. Roberts 
<br/>*<br/>
We had a great day today in <b>swanson channel</b> with at least <b>J pod and K pod</b>!!. I could not ID any L pod members but heard reports they were around. I got a good shot of J45? could not get a good look at the saddle but he was traveling right beside J14.
<br/>Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver 
<br/>*<br/>
On the Western Prince we met up with the <b>L2s (L2, L78, L88)</b> as well as <b>L87 </b>traveling southbound along the northwest side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. They were hugging the coastline, then surprised absolutely everyone by going on a long dive and veering offshore before surfacing among the boats. You can check out some photos of L88 Wavewalker passing by us here. When we left them at about <b>3:50</b> in the afternoon they were again southbound (a little further offshore this time) at about Andrew's Bay.
<br/>Monika Wieland, Western Prince Naturalist 
<br/>*<br/>
I had actually found whales earlier this <b>morning </b>from shore out on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. They were slowly heading north towards the Center for Whale Research, and didn't seem to be in any hurry. We were able to join up with members of <b>J Pod, the L2's and the L12's</b> just as they approached the Turn Point Lighthouse on Stuart Island (<b>1200</b>). It was so beautiful. The whales were coming to the surface in groups of 6-8, and we were able to ID many members of J-Pod including J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J26 Mike, and J27 Blackberry. Soon we also saw L41 Mega, L78 Gaia, and many other L-Pod females. There were several times when the whale groups would come together, and during these times, we'd see lots of upside-down swimming, tail lobs, tail slaps. For the afternoon trip aboard the Western Explorer, we didn't catch up to the whales until they were approaching an area known as the <b>Coal Docks</b> (<b>1415</b>). They started "porpoising" or speed swimming about 300 yards in front of the boat. This was followed by multiple breaches, spyhops, and plenty more rolling around on each other. One whale must have breached at least 6-7 times in a row.
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Explorer 
<br/>*<br/>
In the afternoon we were on land at <b>lime kiln</b> lighthouse. We first saw a small pod of Dall's porpoises and then coming north to south were <b>4 orcas</b> which the docent named as L-78, L-88 and L-26 and L-2. They were fairly close to shore and made for good viewing pleasure on a warm sunny day!
<br/>Liz Heinrich, Equitech
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Arlene Sullivan on Mayne Island, BC, reporting a report from neighbors who saw a pod of <b>orcas </b>heading SW through<b> Active Pass</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
A single <b>gray whale </b>swam past <b>Tulalip Shores</b> Sunday afternoon sometime <b>between 1:30 and 2:00pm</b>, heading south towards Tulalip Bay.
<br/>Vicki Mattson, Tulalip Shores 
<br/>*<br/>
In the <b>morning all three pods</b> were going by my house on <b>Mitchell Pt</b>. so my evening passengers were able to come on down, and we got out to see them. Orcas everywhere. And it's always amazing watching the Residents come out of Active Pass and watching them smell the Fraser River, like yesterday afternoon. Though there were four Orcas that had turned in the morning and were off the West Side (San Juan Isl) , I decided to go North, and we were able to be there and greet them coming out of Active Pass (Active Pass seperates Maynes and Galiano Islands, up there in the Gulf Islands north of the San Juans). 
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
We missed hearing the whales on the hydrophones at LimeKiln, but at <b>9:48 am</b> picked up some GREAT calls at <b>Orca Sound</b>, so they must have been heading north. Sounded like they were having a paty!
<br/>Susan &amp; Howard, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Lots and lots of calls on <b>LimeKiln </b>hydrophones with very little background noise.
<br/>Val Veirs, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Listening to <b>J Pod</b> and (?) on <b>Lime Kiln</b> right now!
<br/>John Boyd, San Juan Island

<br/><br/>
We had a <b>gray whale </b>swim under our sailboat and surface right next to us (yikes, what a surprise!) as we were headed back to Everett Marina. Here are the details: 1 Gray Whale, just north of the green shallow water buoy that is west of <b>Everett Marina </b>traveling WNW, towards Whidbey Island, around <b>6pm</b>. Traveling, surfacing for air every couple of minutes.
<br/>Jennifer Wapenski 
<br/>*<br/>
Howard did a talk at NAS Whidbey Island, and was told the <b>2 Gray whales</b> had been observed that <b>morning </b>off <b>NAS Whidbey</b>, where they have been present for three months (between West Beach/NAS Whidbey) - will be interesting to see how long they stay!
<br/>Susan &amp; Howard, Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
The Ocean Magic II caught up with <b>J Pod</b> just after <b>13:00</b> as they came around the SE point of <b>Lopez Island</b> heading West. They were quite spread out and appeared to be foraging. Our later trip found them South of San Juan Island, very active, with lots of splashing and breaching. They then grouped up and we had some great passes by the whole family! It was great to see both new calves looking very healthy. I happened to click the shutter at the right time and got a fantastic shot of Granny, Ruffles, and (I am assuming) J45, Granny's great-grandson! We left them at <b>17:30</b> at Middle Bank, still West-bound.
<br/>Mika Ogilvie, First Mate on the Ocean Magic II (Prince of Whales) 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod</b> was off <b>Eagle Point</b>, San Juan this afternoon, around <b>4.30pm</b>. They were seen gathering speed as they headed west. In choppy water we watched the individual families file past with spyhops, tail slaps, and breaches, bucking a flood tide. It was awesome to watch them as they surfaced. We got to see individual faces above the waves for a change. The tiny ones looked like they were doing well.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic, POW 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1930</b>: Likely <b>J pod</b> well spread out and moving northward. Few vocals though some great S-4 calls (that neat growl) and some echolocation clicks. 
<br/>Val Veirs, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
Tom Reeve of Lopez Island called to report a pod of <b>~15+ orcas</b> was off S. Lopez Island, heading east to west toward <b>Iceberg Pt</b> at <b>1:30 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Nadia Baker called at <b>11:30 am</b> to report a pod of <b>orcas </b>was heading south from Bellingham Channel, toward where they were kayaking off S. Lopez Island. At <b>1:25 pm</b> she reported the whales had nearly reached <b>Iceberg Pt</b>, S Lopez Isl. 
<br/>*<br/>
Nadja Baker called at <b>1:25 pm </b>to report a <b>Minke whale</b> about 1/4 mile south of <b>Iceberg Pt</b>, S. Lopez Island. 
<br/>*<br/>
A couple of friends of mine who were out flying today spotted a <b>Gray Whale</b> NW of <b>Everett </b>at <b>10:30 AM</b>. It was feeding in the shallows on the shoals. 
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, Langley, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a report of 1 whale observed east of Possession Beach (<b>SW Whidbey Isl</b>) in Possession Sound (probably about 1 mile from shore). Traveling south, <b>5:15AM</b>. Looks like he had somewhere to go. He was heading south pretty quick. He'd surface about every minute and let out a good blow his tail would flop and then go back under. There was a fin on the back, but it wasn't especially big. <i>From this description, it sounds like it was <b>possibly a humpback whale</b> - Grays don't have a dorsal fin, and Minke whales don't have a conspicuous spout and typically don't show their flukes when diving.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>June 26, 2009</b>

Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor on vessels Orca and Starlet, and encountered whales traveling south past Kellett Bluff at 10:52 am (48° 34.146 N; 23° 11.113 W). The whales were very spread out and traveling at a fast pace. Several members of <b>K pod</b> were documented as well as the <b>L2's and L87</b>. The encounter ended two miles off Cattle Point (48° 23.642 N; 123° 01.217W) at 1:34 p.m. The whales were still very spread out across the strait and appeared to be heading west.

Eric and I went flying at <b>2:45 PM</b>, during the low tide and saw a lot of <b>very fresh whale pits</b> in the sand bars northwest of <b>Everett</b>. On our return flight at <b>5:30</b> we saw <b>two gray whales</b> feeding just west of Everett. I was unable to ID the whales.

On our afternoon trip, we headed out to meet up with the Orcas reported to be heading north in <b>Swanson Channel</b>. When we arrived,<b> J Pod</b> was in a tight resting formation, drifting past Village Bay on Mayne Island. We knew that would likely change as they approached Active Pass. Sure enough, the tail slaps started just as they rounded the bend at Helen's Point. The whales stayed fairly tightly together until they were mid-pass, when the action really got going - upside-down swimming, breaches, tail slaps, pec slaps, spyhops - as they approached the tide rips at the east end of the pass. As they were exiting the pass, the whales did a long dive going through the final large tide rips, and surfaced some distance to the east. Once in the Strait of Georgia, the pod split into matriline groups and spread out for the crossing. The mud plume from the Fraser River had spread all the way across the Strait due to the low tide and earlier winds, and the whales seemed to be doing many more spyhops than we usually see as they exit Active Pass. We left J Pod shortly after their exit from Active Pass. They were still heading east towards the coal docks.

<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from Arlene Solomon, reporting a pod of <b>~10 orcas</b>, including 2 - 3 males, heading into the SW entrance of <b>Active Pass</b> between Mayne &amp; Prevost Islands at <b>3 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Hopes were high as we headed west of <b>Salmon Bank</b>. We were all delighted to watch <b>K-11, K- 13, K-25, K-27, K-34, K-20, and K-38</b>, from <b>2:10pm until 3pm</b>, in close family groups foraging as they headed northwest toward Eagle Cove, and two groups of other whales along the shoreline. We came across two <b>Minke </b>whales foraging at <b>Salmon Bank</b>. The first Minke looked like an adult, the second a juvenile with a very curvy-hooked dorsal fin and a small white spot on the left flank. Both whales surfaced more often than we normally see, and close distance to each surfacing, so not so elusive and everyone saw them, along with rafts of marine birds!

<br/>*<br/>
In the area of <b>Middle Bank</b> we caught up with members of <b>L pod</b>. They were split up into family groups and were also showing feeding behaviors. The groups were spread out more than a mile from shore and were headed northwest making quiet vocalizations. By <b>3:30 PM</b> they had only progressed to Eagle Point.

We met up with <b>J-Pod</b> again heading north in <b>Swanson Channel</b> around <b>12 noon</b>. They were in nice tight groups and we spent most of our time observing the <b>J14 </b>family group with J1, J2, and J8. We were able to identify every J- Pod family group but the J16s, so they either went undetected or were off on their own somewhere else. When we left them around 1 PM they were just nearing Otter Bay, still traveling north against a flood tide.

<br/>*<br/>
I watched <b>J-Pod</b> off of <b>Land Bank</b> and Lime Kiln on the west side of San Juan Island from about <b>3:30-4:30</b> in the afternoon. They headed north very close to shore, then turned and started coming back south before veering to the west to meet in the incoming <b>K-Pod</b>. It was definitely one of those special passbys where most of the pod was just off the kelp beds, and onlookers got nice looks at all the J-Pod family groups!
<br/>Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>OrcaSound hydrophone, 1830:</b> First we heard mewing, like in <b>K-pod</b>, and then we heard S-1's as in J-pod. The whales were spread out and their blows drifted north in the southerly, backlit by the ever-so-slow setting sun - they were headed slowly north.
<br/>Val Veirs, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
All the people on land, on the westside of <b>San Juan Island</b> enjoyed seeing <b>Orcas </b>swimming north, near shore, with the flooding tide, from about <b>3:30 to at least 4pm</b>. The whales were spread out from <b>Lime Kiln Point</b> south about a mile. All the boats appeared to maintaining the 1/2 mile from shore, no boat zone.

Between <b>1:10 and 1:45</b> a loose group of <b>orcas </b>passed SJI between <b>False Bay and Eagle Point</b>, moving East while hunting, zigzagging very seriously. They came by in a group of four (male, females, juvenile) followed by a group of 7 or 8, including two males and a very young orca.
<br/>Mary WillAllen, naturalist, The Whale Museum
<br/>*<br/>
Cool <b>orcas </b>off <b>SJI </b>today most of the day. First, <b>J pod</b> went down island on the ebb, then up island on the flood to <b>Lime Kiln</b>, with most of the pod making close passes to shore with lots of surface active behavior. As J1 and J2, among others, went north, most of the pod seemed to stall out around Lime Kiln, still with lots of surface activity. At the same time there were reports that K pod had passed Discovery Island and other reports further north had J1 and J2 disappearing. Minutes after J1 and J2 "disappeared," the orcas at Lime Kiln started heading at a fast pace off shore and towards Discovery. Within minutes J pod, including J1 and J2, were together making great time and distance against a strong flood tide. Several juveniles breached nearly continuously, until J pod met up with K pod and perhaps more than a few L's about a mile off <b>Hannah Heights</b> at around <b>5 p.m</b>. There were whales all over, with much active socializing. There appeared to be at least three groups of ten or more whales in close proximity, rolling all over each other, with much switching of whales (at least sprouters) between the groups. About half of K pod headed in close to the shore at Hannah Heights within 10 minutes of meeting up. At Hannah there was a good chop going on. The K pod whales appeared to be surfing, foraging and playing at the same time. A young calf (K42?) tried to copy the older whales and dove aggressively into a large wave before getting bashed sideways by the pretty good sized wave. The calf kind of wriggled like a fish, righted himself and continued on unabashed after his older brethren. As the flood tide began carrying the main group of orcas up island, the K pod whales that had been close in to the beach headed out and joined up with the main group. I left them just after <b>6 pm</b> still heading up island as a group. On another good note I think I have seen more socializing already this year, than all of last year which seemed to be a continual quest for food.

<br/>*<br/>
In the <b>afternoon </b>as the whales went north past <b>Lime Kiln</b> I was able to get a picture of <b>Gaia L-78</b> and<b> Wave Walker L-88</b>. I don't know if other L Pod whales were present with <b>J Pod and K Pod</b>, but it was interesting to see these whales with Js and Ks. I would imagine that their mom, Grace L-2 was there, but I didn't get a picture of her. L-2, L-78 and L-88 were seen with J and K pods on Monday June 22nd as they all came south down Haro Strait.

I saw <b>2 gray whales</b> off <b>West Beach</b> a little before <b>noon </b>. Looked to be an adult and a young one - could it be that a mom has brought her baby to Whidbey? They were a couple of hundred yards off-shore, and appeared to be heading SSW.

We met up with the [<b>orcas</b>] crossing to San Juan Island. They had been traveling quite fast according to the other boats and they ended up splitting into 2 or more groups, with some whales moving towards the southern half of the island and others northbound up Haro Strait. The Orcas were quite spread out in all directions - apparently it was J pod and K pod. We had some wonderful views of 2 younger calves playing in the currents where the kelp was collecting, along with logs and other debris. One even draped a bit of kelp across its dorsal fin!! We moved north, from one group to another and left them off of <b>Kellet Bluff</b>, Henry Island as we looped around the north side of San Juan Island. 
Then the sunset tour. <b>J pod</b> had covered some ground and was up in the Canadian Gulf Islands. We were able to watch <b>J27 (Blackberry)</b> who at 18 is turning into quite the large male. Along with J27 was his sister J31 and a sprouter male who I believe was J34. We were able to also get great looks at <b>J26</b>, the other 18 year old male with his mom <b>J16 </b>and younger sibling <b>J42</b>. Again very active tonight! Breach after breach, even by the little calf! The next family group included <b>J17, J28, and newborn J44?</b>

Got to finally catch up with <b>J pod</b> off Lime Kiln on Monday <b>evening</b>. They started coming by around <b>17:15</b> or so. I believe we got to see them all. They were fairly vocal as they swam by, Bob Otis had his radio out there with the hydrophones so we could hear them calling. Was a very windy time out there and the only boats were a couple watches out of Canada. The boats were so far out there, as the pod was very spread out. Take care!

Center for Whale Research received a report from Soundwatch of 40 plus whales traveling south from East Point on Saturna Island, B.C. at 12:25 p.m. At <b>2:00 p.m.</b> Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah encountered <b>J's and K's</b> in mixed tight groups traveling at a fast pace southwest through Boundary Pass (48° 43.930 N; 123° 09.584 W). The whales continued to travel past Turn Point and spread out across Haro Strait (48° 36.568 N; 123° 14.784W). All members of J and K pod were confirmed present as well as the L2's and L87. The rest of L pod reportedly went west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca earlier that morning.

We spotted some whales travelling along the shores of <b>Point Roberts</b>, as they occasionally do when in the area. Initially, just a few whales were seen, then offshore, we started to see more fins. The whales were spread out over an area that was several square miles. They were travelling alone, or in very small groups, slowly drifiting with the tide, with no obvious direction of travel, and often doing long dives. We were fortunate to observe <b>K26 (Lobo)</b> spending some quality time with younger brother <b>K42</b>, even doing some side-by-side foraging. Further out in the Strait, we encountered <b>J1 and J2</b>. At one point, J1 lunged, presumably after a fish, and following that, J2 (Granny) breached twice - one a forward arch, and then one standard up in the air breach. Our passengers were so impressed when they heard that she may be approaching 100 years of age and still had that kind of energy and flexibility. Surprisingly, vocals were very sparse, and with almost no boat traffic, we would have been able to hear them for miles.

2 days in a row of <b>all three pods</b> of Southern Residents! At <b>1500</b>, we observed the whales making the turn around Turn Island, and they really started pouring on the speed as they headed down Haro Strait. First came members of J Pod. We observed J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J30 Riptide as they porpoised past the boat. Then came a mixture of J's &amp; Ls. I heard that there were members of K Pod as well, but I didn't observe any from our location. As they are known to do, as the whales made their way south, they began to spread out in smaller matriline groups. At <b>1600</b>, the whales were approaching <b>Kellett Bluff</b>.

All of <b>J-Pod</b> with some <b>L's and K's</b> porpoising, power swimming, against the strong flood tide, from Saturna Island southwest across <b>Boundary Pass</b> toward Stuart Island, from <b>2:20pm to 3:25pm</b>. They were traveling quite fast, in tight knit family groups. As we watched the first group approach Turn Point and the tide rips, one whale spy hopped, then 2 in unison, then the breaches started. There were 4 to 5 orcas in each group, 8 groups total, in that time period, heading around the point into Haro Strait. In every group, whales spy hopped, breached, lunged, cartwheeled, back flipped, pectoral slapped, or tail lobbed as they closed in on Stuart Island! Words can't describe the fantastic, countless breaches, percussive and surface behaviors!! Even J-1 Ruffles joined the party and breached!

The orcas were in or very close to <b>Mutiny Bay</b>, Whidbey Island at around <b>3pm</b>. I believe there were at least 7 or 8 of them. There was one "baby" that looked very new. A couple of them have some pretty distinctive notches in their dorsal fins so maybe that could help to identify them.

We saw an incredible display by <b>J Pod</b> at <b>1:45 to 2:15pm</b>. We first spotted the dorsals just North of <b>American Camp</b> on the West side of San Juan. The pod was moving north, in small group of 3 or 4 spread out along maybe a 1/4 quarter mile. Whales were close to shore, sometime within 10 feet just south of False Bay. The males and some younger whales really put on the show with dual spy hops, cartwheels, full breaches by the younger whales and lots of tail slapping. Mike, Alki and Blackberry were identified by the naturalist on aboard. Very interesting was the identification of a male, Mega, from L Pod and the naturalist thought there may have been some mating outside of False Bay. First hand viewing seemed to confirm this may have been the case. J Pod continued North toward Lime Kiln when we left and turned South.

We spent our afternoon on the northwest corner of San Juan Island in Speiden Channel with Southern Resident Orcas from <b>J &amp; L pods</b>! J pod was just passing <b>Henry Island</b> and playing in a rip or current where presumbably they were fishing. They were very active - changing direction, tail slapping, and even some logging at the surface by 1 or 2 whales. They continued north forming tight groups and picked up speed with a few Orcas porpoising out of the water with force. Then slowing again - more activity - even a few breaches! The <b>L12 </b>subgroup was not far behind also traveling north.

Howard Garrett, calling from the Center for Whale Research on west San Juan Island reported the <b>L12s </b>heading north off Eagle Pt. and <b>J pod</b> off Iceberg Pt. heading south at <b>10:30 am</b>. Orcas also reported off Salmon Bank at 10:55. At 1:10 pm, J pod &amp; the L12s were passing the Center heading north. At 2:30 pm the Center received reports that the orcas up north were now in Active Pass, heading south, so it looks like a Superpod is in the making! Update: Howard joined Ken Balcomb and the Center for Whale Research staff in heading up to see the superpod - they encountered them at approx. <b>4:10 pm</b> off the NW tip of<b> Stuart Island</b>, and left them at about <b>6:25 pm</b> south of Saturna Island, as all three pods headed north toward Boundary Pass. Ken Balcomb reported that they had looked through all their photos &amp; film from the superpod encounter, and <b>all known whales in the Southern Resident Orca community were present and accounted for</b> - great news for Orca Month!!

We heard <b>J-Pod</b> was slowly working their way north near <b>Kellett Bluff</b>. Soon (<b>1330</b>) we were watching J-Pod actively working the tide rips in search of salmon near Kellett Bluff. Lots of direction changes as the whales did their thing, sometimes maintaining their position by swimming into the current. We saw several spyhops, tail slaps, and I was especially excited to see my "buddy" J1 Ruffles. We also saw <b>J30 </b>Riptide, and one of the new moms (her saddle was hidden by the waves in the riptide). But the day suddenly got even better. We had heard reports of a group of unidentified whales passing Campbell River last night around 1800. We got a report from a friend that a large group of "maybe Transients" had just made it through Active Pass. Soon (<b>1430</b>) we were off of Prevost Island and saw fins. LOTS OF FINS. Before we knew it, whales started breaching everywhere! Not acting like Transients, we soon thought--Residents?? And that's when we began to make some IDs, <b>L78 </b>(Gaia), <b>L72 </b>(Racer), <b>L7 </b>(Canuck), <b>K26 </b>(Lobo), K<b></b>16 (Opus), <b>K21 </b>(Cappucino), and <b>K40 </b>(Raggedy). We left the whales heading South in <b>Swanson Channel</b> near Thieves Bay at 1500.

Well over a dozen <b>orcas </b>headed west from <b>Aleck Bay</b> toward Iceberg Point at about <b>10:30</b> this morning. Their travel pace was pretty relaxed but they made sure to give a show on the way: a couple nice breaches, some tail slaps and several spy hops.

Just reporting a sighting of a pod of <b>Orcas </b>right off <b>Mutiny Bay</b> on <b>Whidbey Island</b>. It was about <b>3pm </b>. They were heading towards Seattle initially but then turned around and appeared to be circling in the shipping channel. We aren't familiar with the various pods but this one seemed to include at least <b>7 whales</b>, including one baby and another younger (1 year old?) one. They were traveling then would stop, play and go in various directions. They seemed to be feeding on something-we saw lots of fish on our fish finder and some [porpoise] in the distance but couldn't really see what they were eating.

Jeff Dodd of Langley called this afternoon to report a sighting of <b>4 orcas</b> from the <b>Port Townsend/Keystone ferry</b> at <b>1 pm</b>. It appeared to be 4 females, milling off Pt. Hudson, between Pt Hudson &amp; Pt. Wilson. They were about 1/4 mile from a large bait ball and some seals - not sure, but a guess would be these are Transients, likely the group reported last night off west Whidbey.

Got a chance to take my little girl out to see the <b>gray whales</b> for the first time in her life. They are still around the northern section of West Beach RD heading south. I realize you already received a great picture from a spotter but I was able to catch both the bigger whale and the calf coming up to spout in unison. Unfortunately I was on the shore and they were 100 yards or so out.

We watched <b>2 gray whales</b> for half an hour around <b>3:30 pm</b> at the pull-out south of Swan lake on <b>West beach road on Whidbey Island</b>. They were swimming side by side, hanging out in the same area close to shore and then slowly moved South and away from shore some more. We never saw their flukes.

At <b>Turn Point</b> the Prince of Whales zodiac met up with members of <b>J Pod</b> around <b>1pm</b>. The whales were so active with numerous breaches etc. They were slowly heading toward the Strait of Georgia.

We were priviliged to observe <b>J27 </b>(Blackberry) and little brother <b>J39 </b>(Mako) engaged in some playful behaviour. Photo of J39 doing a teasing spyhop. On the other boat, Sue (the Naturalist) reported <b>J42 </b>(Echo) and little <b>J45 </b>performing alternating spyhops, while the remainder of their matrilines milled nearby.

Once at the <b>naval air station</b>, Whidbey Island we watched two<b> Gray Whales</b> feeding in 20'-40' of water. One was definitely a larger adult with the second one most likely being a juvenile. They would take several breaths and then dive for 2-3 minutes. They were moving in generally a southward direction. As we were leaving for our sunset trip we came upon a <b>Minke Whale</b> in the mouth of Friday Harbor. It slowly circled the boat in a feeding pattern. It was taking single breaths and then diving for approximately 2 minutes.

A group of 5 of the <b>L-12, L-22's</b> in a fairly close formation, slowly swimming from the <b>Salmon Bank</b> buoy northwest toward San Juan Island, from <b>12:55pm to 1:50pm</b>. At first they seemed to be traveling in 2 groups, then all 5 came together, and appeared to be resting in the slack flood tide with little tidal exchange. I could ID L-12, L-89 (Solstice near the Solstice!), and not sure, but think the other male was L-85, along with 2 other females. The sun glinting off their backs and through the spray of their exhalations, the 2 males shoulder to shoulder coming up together, was beautiful, but made it difficult to ID.

We were on our way to the Victoria area this afternoon to watch the 3 <b>Transients </b>that had shown up there, when something in the water caught the eye of Captain John. We were just south of Beaver Point on <b>Saltspring Island</b> when <b>T20 and T21</b> surfaced. They were doing very long dives, 7-8 minutes at a time, and were likely resting. They still followed a zig-zagging pattern though, making it very difficult to predict where they would surface again. Given the long dives, it was pure chance that these whales were spotted at all. We left T20 and T21 after <b>4 PM</b>, travelling in a mostly northerly direction towards Navy Channel.

Neal Thomsen called today to report a sighting from 2 miles from shore at 
<b>Casper, CA</b>, just south of Ft. Bragg. He said at least <b>9 orcas</b> were harassing at least one seal. The party boat captain saw breaches from a distance and went to investigate. Three large males went south, leaving two juveniles and four others bashing and flinging the seal before letting it get back to the rocks. 
<br/>*<br/>
Just to let you know that the <b>L12's, K20 and K38</b> went west early in the morning. So the (orca) sightings in Puget Sound must have been transients. Mark Malleson found the L12's, K20 and K38 at aprox <b>11:30 am</b> off Jordan River, B.C going west.

A report of a <b>humpback </b>whale sent us into the Strait of Juan de Fuca off of <b>Pile Point</b> from about <b>1:10pm to 2pm</b> during slack ebb tide. We watched the whale surfacing, taking 4 to 5 breaths, then diving from 4-6 minutes. The juvenile, about 40'? in length, seemed to be zig zagging as it was slowly working it's way west-northwest, as it would surface offshore, then the next surfacing would be inshore, repeating this transecting pattern. Only saw the flukes once, it showed the arching of it's body- the humped back- on every last surfacing before it dove! On our way out in the Strait we saw 2 groups of 3 Dall's Porpoise.

We caught up with the <b>L12 sub-group</b> off of the <b>south end of San Juan Island </b>today. They were traveling mainly along the coastline, but at South Beach they took a right turn and moved offshore. L41 "Mega" was seen as well as L12 "Alexis" who was photographed by one of our guests. The group as a whole was very active with lots of seemingly playful behavior occuring, like multiple spyhops by one animal, repetitive tail lobbing by a juvenile and an adult that rolled over behind our boat and proceeded to beat the water with a pectoral flipper. The animals would bunch-up and then separate and were continuing to move further offshore when we departed the scene at <b>2:45 PM</b>.

From <b>1:15pm to 2:05pm</b>, we were delighted to watch <b>L-41, L-77, K-20, and K-38</b>, actively foraging off of <b>False Bay</b>. They headed west-northwest at first, then made directional changes and milling as the flood tide picked up. Lots of percussive behaviors- tail slaps, pectoral slaps, and breaches! L-41 was upside down, repeatedly slapping his curled tail flukes back on the surface! Nice to see the K's with the L's, and familiar behavior- hope they got some salmon.

The <b>3.30pm</b> Ocean Magic encountered some of <b>L pod orca</b> this afternoon off <b>San Juan Island</b>. We found 'Mega', L 41 and 'Alexis, L 12, foraging 1-2 miles offshore from other members of this family group. We watched for a while and then moved closer to shore where we watched L 77 'Matia' and two others that I weren't able to identify, as they were far off. They were all heading North. I did hear that K 20 and K38 had joined this group so perhaps those two seen very close to shore were the K's.
<br/>As if that wasn't magic enough (see above report), on the way back we sighted two more <b>Orca </b>off Seabird Lighthouse, Discovery Island, and they turned out to be<b> T20 and T21</b>. We only saw them once and then they disappeared.

<br/>Forwarded report: My name is Julia and I am working with pinnipeds at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR. On Tuesday I saw a group of at least <b>8 orcas</b> off the <b>central Oregon coast</b> traveling southwards, between <b>5:40 pm</b> and around <b>9:00 pm</b>. The group consisted of two big males (one of them has a very remarkable dorsal fin - looks like cut at the tip), several adult females and probably one calf. The first sighting was at 5:41 pm pretty close to the shore in Depoe Bay. They spent about 20 minutes in the bay before slowly traveling south. A sea lion was present but the orcas seemed not to be interested at all. I followed them and saw them again off Rocky Creek State Park, Otter Crest and Cape Foulweather. Off Rocky Creek they were playing (or hunting?) and breaching. One of the big males separated from the group (maybe with one or more group members) and continued traveling south. From time to time they swam farther off shore and were hard to see. I ended up watching at Moolack Beach where the they were pretty close to the beach again. They showed almost the same behavior as off Rocky Creek for at least an hour. Around sunset they swam farther off shore again and I lost sight.

<br/>We forwarded these photos to orca researchers and received the following replies:
<i>"I can ID <b>T125 and T127</b> from the attached photos. It would be likely that both T125A and T128 would be present as well.

Then at ~1:45 pm he saw the group of 5, watched them milling &amp; possibly feeding for about 10 minutes, then they just seemed to disappear, so he couldn't tell which direction they came from or left toward.

<b>Orcas </b>off the <b>central oregon coast </b>- around <b>7:30 p.m</b>. my boyfriend and I were sitting in our hot tub over looking <b>Otter Rock</b> watching <b>a grey whale</b> and some sea lions close to the beach when further off shore, just west of Bird Rock we spotted fins and ran to get the binoculars. I was certain they were Orcas because the fins were just too large to be porpoises. We figured we would watch them as they continued to travel north and that would be it -- but the excitement was just beginning. Three adults and one baby Orca came right into shore so we jumped out of the hot tub and drove down the street to the point over looking Devils punchbowl to get a closer look. They were so close we did not need our binoculars. They were breaching over and over again! We were the only people out there on the head land to see this until we phoned one neighbor, then the word got out and within 10 minutes half the neighborhood showed up! A group of three sea lions began swimming south from the marine gardens and were headed straight toward the Orcas! When the sea lions discovered the trouble they were in all three jumped out the water and dove toward the rocks. We couldn't figure out if all this breaching, rolling and tail slapping was some kind of ritual, play, mating or feeding?? Still unsure if they had a sea lion under water that they were feeding on or if the sea lions got away? The pod finally said goodbye and continued on their journey North about <b>8:30 p.m.</b>

<b>1900-2030</b> pst. Pod of <b>4 orca</b>. One large dorsal, 3 smaller. Viewed from Devils Punchbowl State Park, <b>Otter Rock, OR.</b> 10 miles north of Newport, OR. Full breaches, tail slapping, for about 30 minutes. Moved north towards Cape Foulweather and Depoe Bay. Probably feeding on Otter Rock resident harbor seals. Very few gray calves have been spotted yet. The grays usually begin to be abundant around June/July close to the Otter Rock shoreline. We usually see one or two lone transients here.

We were fishing out of Neah Bay, first sighting was <b>Humpbacks </b>11 miles out near J bouy. This is the east end of Swiftsure bank, there were 4 together and we saw them in a feeding pattern for many hours. One very large one did a full straight up breach and rose to about the rear hump, maybe 75 yards from us - very impressive! We thought that sharing the water with the humpbacks had made for an epic day and on our return about two miles west of Tatoosh Island <b>a pod of orcas</b> came in sight! Very actively feeding while we paralled them for a good period and made note the largest male had a dorsal that was turned over in a very tight curl at the top (right to left curled). I guess there were six or seven in the group with one small one probably half the size of the rest.

You probably have gotten this by now, but six (likely Ks) <b>Orcas </b>were reprorted at the <b>County Park</b> yesterday morning about <b>9:00 AM</b>.

In all my 20 yrs. watching Killer Whales, I've never seen just two SRKW's on their own for such a long time. Several years ago, I saw J1 nip at a female, and for the next few days she and her small line, three offspring as I remember, wandered the Islands by themselves for a week or so. Very interesting.

We were thrilled to see a <b>pod of orcas</b> as we approached the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> at <b>1441</b>. We observed them for about an hour from a distance of 1/4 mile or so. Pictures are attached (see above). We were at 48° 03.3' and 124° 54.0' (west of Lake Ozette, ). It is estimated that there were 8 orcas, 3 of them adult males, traveling SE.

I was rowing around the south end of Rat Island (near Indian Island across from <b>Port Townsend</b>) about 100 yards past the turn inside the green buoy. At very low tide I know it's about 20 or 30 feet deep there since I can sometimes see the eel grass. Anyway my right blade hit something and immediately thereafter a <b>Gray whale</b> blew briefly right under my port rigger - and then dived, brushing the bottom of my boat with its back or tail. I'm pretty sure the whale was as surprised as I was. Did the whale see me? I think not. After our encounter this morning the whale took off toward the Navy dock, and then circled back to swim parallel to my path and blew a couple of more times. It never did breach and I never really saw its body but I would guess it was at least 25 feet long and made quite a wake just below the surface as it swam away from me.

We conducted one of our monthly outer coast surveys from <b>Westport, WA</b>. It was incredibly calm, both in terms of weather and whales. We saw <b>two gray whales</b>, <b>two humpbacks</b>, small numbers of <b>Dall's and harbor porpoise</b>, and one northern fur seal all day. One interesting note was a gray whale that we found in the midst of a high density of crab pots. We were worried when we saw the whale swimming right into a set of buoys at the surface, but then it did it again, and again - at one point the whale actually took a set of buoys down with it when it dove, only to release them 10 seconds later. We were preparing ourselves for an entanglement, but apparently it was well aware of what it was doing, rubbing itself along the lines.

We have just heard from our vessel that they have encountered members of <b>L Pod</b> (the L12's) near <b>Albert Head, B.C.</b> This is the first confirmed sighting of members of L Pod in the waters off Victoria this season and what a wonderful surprise! 
<br/>Andrew Lees, Five Star Whale Watching 
<br/>*<br/>
At a little before <b>3:00 this afternoon</b>, the <b>L12s </b>showed up a little to the east of Race Rock. Late in the evening, we left <b>L89 </b>and <b>L22 </b>way out west of Victoria this evening at <b>6:30</b>. We were lucky enough to see these breaches.

We had the <b>T-2s</b> I believe today along with <b>T-14</b> in the <b>Campbell River</b> area. Left on our tour at <b>1515 </b>from C.R. with reports of orcas off of Fransisco Point, south end of Quadra Island. Went around and found <b>5 </b>animals in post feeding activity. The young one was breaching alot, and amazing vocalization for about 40 minutes. Afterwards we headed to the mouth of Bute Inlet and found a black bear foraging along the shoreline. We found another black bear on Sonora Island on the way home, and some info on the way turned into finding "Pender" T-14 Southbound @ Cape Mudge (see photo above). A beautiful trip and happy guests with a 4hr safari turning into 6hrs!

We have <b>Orcas </b>off the south end of <b>Quadra island BC</b>. @ <b>1425 </b>. 4 or 6 orcas; <b>Humpback </b>in the area as well.

Orca Network received a call from Jane at the Cape Mears Lighthouse, west of <b>Tillamook OR</b> reported 2 <b>orcas </b>west of the lighthouse, heading north at <b>3:23 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
Linda Taylor from the Whale Center in <b>Depoe Bay OR</b> called to report <b>3 or 4 orcas</b> about 1/2 mile outside Depoe Bay, heading north fast, at<b> 8:45AM</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We had some great looks at a <b>Gray Whale</b> today off of the beach near <b>NAS Whidbey Island</b>. It was foraging alone in approximately 25' of water and moving in no particular direction.  I am guessing that this is the same animal that we have been seeing in the area for several days.

Kraig Hansen of Snohomish County Parks said they are still having sightings of a <b>Gray whale </b>or two in the <b>Everett </b>area this week. 
<br/>*<br/>
Chuck Niedzialkowski called at <b>2:20 pm</b> to report <b>2 Gray whales</b> off <b>NAS Whidbey</b> - one larger, &amp; one smaller, off the Norwester Bldg, just south of the airstrip. They were there yesterday, June 1 as well, and had been there in the same area since <b>10 am</b> this morning, feeding about 150 yards out.

<br/><br/>
We saw one small <b>gray whale</b>, slowly traveling south off of NAS Whidbey Island, last Monday, from about <b>2 to 2:20pm</b>.

One <b>gray whale</b> in <b>Boundary Bay</b> today. It was actively foraging the entire time we were there - about 45 minutes. When we began to leave, very slowly making our way out of the area, the whale suddenly appeared alongside the boat, and then one more time before turning back to its foraging area. On May 27, there were 5 grays in the bay - at least 3 of which had been there since mid-April. I think this whale is our final visitor for the season.

<b>Gray whale</b> today at <b>2:20 pm</b> near <b>Whidbey Island Naval Base</b>. These whales have a streamlined body with a narrow, tapered head. Gray whales are always great to watch, we observed the whale foraging. We even saw the whales fluke. Gray whales are bottom sediment feeders. The whale exhibited the predictable breathing pattern. Gray whales are a mysticete or baleen whale and have two blow holes. Sometimes you can see a heart or v-shaped spray.

What a magnificent start to Orca Month with over <b>20 Transient Orcas</b> in the <b>Strait of Juan De Fuca</b>! During our afternoon tour we were incredibly fortunate to not only observe two Harbor Seal kills by the Transient Orcas but <b>a greeting ceremony</b> as two different groups met north of <b>Port Angeles</b>. We observed one dramatic kill in particular as a young Orca porpoised directly towards a harbor Seal and then exploded onto the poor unsuspecting Seal! Later as the two groups met we saw a number of tailslaps, Spyhops, pectoral waves and breaches, it was breathtaking to watch.
<br/>Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching 
<br/>*<br/>
The call came - <b>3 miles N of Dungeness Spit</b>, which is near <b>Sequim</b>. One of the other captains announced that there was a seal to the port side of his boat. No sooner said, three female <b>orcas </b>headed toward the poor seal at top speed, porpoising through the water with blazing speed. The captain said he just saw the seal turn its head toward the onrushing Orcas about a second before he was gone. This all happened so quickly that I missed most of it with my camera but not the eyes. We left about <b>4:00 PM</b> and shortly after that the last boat on scene departed and the Ts were not to be found again yesterday evening.

<b>8:30AM:</b> Fred Rice, a visitor at the Klaloch Lodge in <b>Klaloch WA</b>, reported <b>2 orcas</b> headed <b>north </b>and a pair of <b>gray whales</b> headed south, seen from shore at the lodge. One looked like a male.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>7:15AM:</b> Ian Young, Captain of the Point Lobo for the <b>Monterey Bay</b> Aquarium Inst., reported <b>3 orcas</b>, 2 adults and a calf, heading east to the beach where seals and sea lions are, at 36,48.00 N, 121,48.20 W
