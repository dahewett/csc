<br/><br/>
<b>J's &amp; L's</b> about 4 miles south of American Camp as they slowly moved South (SW. San Juan Island). Then a 180 had them heading North towards Lime Kiln. They passed Lime Kiln, only to turn around to pass Lime Kiln again and headed East. As they passed the lighthouse, we observed several breaches close to shore. The direction changes kept us on our toes all day, that's for sure! Lots of breaching, lobtailing, and even a brief spotting of a "sea snake"!  One of the younger whales (no ID) was spotted playing with something near the park, slowly pushing it around with his nose. Great day.

<b>7:00 PM</b> - <b>J &amp; L</b> Pods near Cattle Pass moving towards Eagle Point. Whales are frolicking and seem to be enjoying the beautiful <b>evening</b>.
<br/>Capt.  Jim Maya, Maya's Charters

<br/>*<br/>
Had a great time at Lime Kiln Park today watching J pod breach, dive and frolic around.

We left <b>Js</b> headed down San Juan Is. at Lime Kiln Pk. at <b>7:00 PM</b> this evening. <b>Ls</b> were south of Lopez Is.
<br/>Capt .Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
<br/>San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
I saw <b>J-Pod</b> passing the Center for Whale Research, W. San Juan Island (this time heading towards my house), so I jumped in the car and zoomed over to San Juan County Park.  Just in time to see the pod already porpoising by towards Lime Kiln.  So I jump in the car again, zoom down to the lighthouse just as J-Pod rounded the corner. They were aways offshore, but it was a beautiful evening so I just sat and relaxed as they went by. Then into the car again to catch them at Eagle Cove, but they never arrived. Must have done the old West Side Shuffle! :)

<br/><br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> at False Bay...Tons of vocalizations, including a couple of very deep grunting vocalizations added so much to the viewing. J's were taking their time as they moved South East. Last reports had them around Hein Bank in the evening. 
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Lpod</b> going west, left them nearing Otter Pt. in the am.
Met <b>transients</b> at Race Rocks, as this is a restricted area to us, we pulled out. I did see 1 Male, 1 Female later reports from around the area indicate 1 Male 2 females but they stayed in the sanctuary, maybe T40's? 
<b>Jpod</b> had come to the west side in the mean time, I left them south of False Bay going South at <b>1500</b>.

<b>Lpod</b> was on the South side of San Juan Is. until at least <b>2000</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
As we rounded Cattle Point, we found that the <b>J's and some L's</b> had moved on up north towards the Center for Whale Research, while the remainder of the L's (excluding the L's with K Pod) headed slowly south towards Cattle Point.

<b>L's</b> in from the west as Ken stated, <b>J's</b> down Boundary Pass
they all met 4 miles east of Discovery Is. and 4 miles west of Pile Pt. this afternoon.
At <b>2100</b> they were 2.5-3 miles off Eagle Pt. going towards Port Townsend.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria BC
<br/>*<br/>
...the distinct calls of <b>J-Pod</b> coming out clearly on the hydrophone.  The calls were as loud and clear as I've ever heard on our boat, and then J-Pod made a 90 degree turn and headed South out towards Middle Bank. As we listened &amp; watched, we heard a literal symphony of calls near and far, and realized we were listening to <b>both J's &amp; L's</b>! Later as the two pods approached, we saw multiple breaches, including a few dual whale breaches.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research just relayed a report of <b>L's</b> coming back in near Otter Pt. this morning.

<b>Jpod</b> came accross the top end of Rosario and into Boundary Pass this afternoon. Left them going to Lime Kiln from Andrews bay about <b>1545</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>MMRG, Victoria
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> decided to give us yet another curve ball by altering what has been a somewhat regular pattern of coming down from Pt. Roberts and heading down Rosario/Bellingham Channel. Today they decided that Eastpoint/Boundary Pass was the way to go. They weren't in a big hurry until they started heading from Pender towards the Turn Point Lighthouse, where they picked up lots of speed. The action really got going as they passed from Stuart Island towards Henry Island. The whales began porpoising as they moved south. One whale went into a 9 breach cycle. We left the whales passing Lime Kiln heading in a southerly direction.

He also reports a single <b>gray</b> whale at March Pt, south of the refinery docks at the N. entrance to Swinomish Channel. Shane called again to report the gray whale was being VERY active - 4 breaches, 6 spyhops!
<br/>*<br/>

We had <b>J pod</b> up North <b>all day</b>. On our <b>morning</b> trip, the whales were located just north of the the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal, and we left them just north of Point Roberts. They were quite active this morning, lots of foraging and some breaches. Even J1 did a whale cartwheel, a standard breach and 2 high porpoise leaps. 
On our <b>afternoon</b> trip we caught up with <b>J pod</b> just west of the Cherry Point oil refinery, at Alden Bank. They were on a very slow travel southbound, still doing a little foraging, with 2 subpods resting.

We left <b>Js and Ls</b> going north toward Swanson Ch. at <b>8:30 PM</b>. It was an amazing evening. Socialization was the theme of the
evening. They would travel a bit then socialize. Almost constant
breaching, rolls, tail lobbing and pairing off.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J Pod</b> was heading towards San Juan from Iceberg (Lopez), I stopped off at Cattle Point Lighthouse just in time to see J-Pod fake like they were going to head north up San Juan Channel as they passed Whale Rocks, only to swerve right next to the lighthouse and head past Salmon Bank and Eagle Point. As usual when they cross San Juan Channel, they were extremely active with lots of porpoising and breaching, tailslaps and cartwheels.
<br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
A man said he saw what he believes were <b>orcas</b> in Crescent Harbor (Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) about <b>10:30 a.m</b>. He saw a tall dorsal fin and saw a smaller animal also.
<br/>Susan Mador, Oak Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
<b>0700</b> - <b>Orcas</b> passing at a gallop by west side Lummi island - by <b>0720</b> they (J's most likely) were already heading into Rosario Strait. They were quite spread out and porpoising and there were some breaches as well!

<br/>Azuriel Mayo
<br/>Capt./Deer Harbor Charters
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J pod</b> in Active Pass today (<b>3 p.m.</b>) just before they left it to cross the Strait of Georgia towards Fraser River. They say that when the whales leave the pass, they often start breaching like crazy - well, it turned out to be true today too- multiple breaches for about 10 minutes, including a few big ones by our old pal, Ruffles (J1). Also lots of tail lobbing and some spyhops.
<br/>Penny Stone, naturalist
<br/>Great Orca Adventures (the Mercury)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J&amp;L Pod</b> traveling together past the house at <b>10:00 AM</b>. They were in a very tight group and beautiful to see them together! Later, as they approached Henry Island, J Pod continued North while L Pod stayed in Open Bay. Then in the afternoon L Pod headed South along the west side of San Juan Island.  Very spread out about 1 mile off shore. As the group approached False Bay, they got very active in their feeding, with lunges and porpoising. L-41, L-57 traveling fairly close together, with L-79 further out.  <br/>John Boyd (JB)
<br/>Naturalist, San Juan Excursions 
<br/>*<br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research said <b>L pod</b> passed by the Center (w. San Juan Island) at about <b>11 am</b> this morning, heading north. He said the L's last seen with K pod last month are still not with the rest of L pod.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-Pod</b> at Edwards Point off the west side of San Juan Island. It looked like most all of J-Pod was present, with J-22 (Oreo) and family putting on a great breach &amp; tailslap show. Even J-1 (Ruffles) got into the excitement with a small breach and a huge dorsal fin slaps!

We left <b>J pod</b> near Vancouver BC tonight at about <b>7:30 pm</b>. They were still
headed north past the entance to the river.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters

<br/>*<br/>
We received a call a little after <b>10 am</b> from Newport Tradewinds, reporting a pod of <b>orcas</b> between the #7 buoy and the jetty off Newport, OR. The caller didn't have a number of whales or any description, but said there was a Coast Guard boat on site, &amp; we're hoping someone from OSU might be out with them getting some ID shots or more details. 
<br/>*<br/>
Met <b>J-pod</b> off of Sandy Point, near Lummi island, heading South. We left them at <b>2:45</b> and they continued along Lummi then turned back North in the evening.

<b>J &amp; L pods</b> in the waters off S. Vancouver Island heading toward San Juan Island &amp; according to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research "Still no K's and none of the L's seen off Tofino with K's on 17 May", which means there is still a tiny glimmer of hope that they could be off the west coast &amp; will stop to pick up Luna before coming home. We did get a report from up off Queen Charlotte Island, but Orcalab ID'd them as the A36's.

We left <b>J Pod</b> about two miles south of Trial Island, headed east toward
San Juan Island, at about <b>7:00 PM</b>. <b>L Pod</b> was a couple of
miles behind them. I would think it will be a good day to see them off
of San Juan Is. tuesday.

Bill Evanovich today reported a large pod of orcas circumnavigating Langara Island BC (N. tip of Queen Charlotte Island), Sat. &amp; Sun (June 5 &amp; 6). The pod was probably 40 - 50 whales, with at least 3 - 4 large males. He took photos which will be shared with DFO Researchers for identification.
<br/>*<br/>
Saw some <b>Ls</b> near Race Rocks. We emailed a photo of L78 to the Center For Whale Research which they confirmed. L67 and L101 were ID'd in the group as well.  The lead whales (three or four of them) were heading north west, about 750 meters west of Race Rocks at about <b>6:40 pm</b>. We also saw about eight more whales (including L67, L78 and L101) around <b>6:50 PM</b> at Pedder Bay heading west. A spyhop and a breech ended our day.

...<b>L pod</b> near James Island and continued northbound in Rosario Strait well past Point Lawrence. Normally they head south in this area and continue their loop back back to the west side of San Juan Island but yesterday they were riding a huge flood tide the other direction. Tons of breaching activity from several youngsters!
<br/>Jim Roe, Biz Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
We did not get out on L pod yesterday as they were way south and they showed up on a team arrival day. From the the visual i.d.'s we heard, it sounded like the same L's we had before. There was not even a rumour of K's or the missing 7 L12's except for L41 being around. However, L41's matriline (the L11's) will (and has been) disattach from the rest of L12's and travel with L57's crowd.

<b>Lpod</b> was most interesting today, whales over a very wide area this morning going towards Salmon Bank from west of Hein Bank and splitting this <b>afternoon</b>. Contact right outside Victoria Harbour just after <b>1300</b>. going west..only about 9 whales. <b>J's</b> as you know down Boundary to the west side this <b>afternoon</b>.

...<b>L-Pod</b>, coming back to the area after a week-long hiatus. We were near False Bay when we saw the Orcas slowly milling in a southeast direction. L41 and L57 were traveling somewhat close to each other, with most of the whales traveling in groups of 2-3.  As we made our way back towards Cattle Point and home, the whales started moving across from American Camp towards Salmon Bank, and the show really got exciting! We counted 32 breaches (6 from one juvenile alone) and the group began gathering and getting more active!

Early morning reports had orcas inbound around Discovery &amp; Trial Island, but no ID. When we arrived on the West side of San Juan just North of False Bay, we had a positive ID of Mike, Granny, and Ruffles (<b>J pod</b>) as they worked the strong tides (there was a very big flood tide).

I don't know if it was J-pod, but a lot of <b>Orcas</b> came by here (about a mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse on the west side of San Juan Island), last night about <b>7 PM</b> heading south. They must have turned around and come back.

...about <b>8:pm to 8:45pm</b>
location: Point Defiance, headed north, believe to be 2 <b>humpback</b> whales not traveling in any hurry, they would surface and blow several times before showing thier fluke on the longer dives lasting 5 to 8 minutes (the ones we timed. We did see 2 on the surface at once. Very dark backs and bigger than any other whale I have ever seen.

Brandon of Ferndale called to report seeing <b>J pod</b> off the west side of San Juan Island on June 1, from about <b>11 am - 1:30 pm</b>. He had definite ID's of J26 &amp; J2, and said the pod was really close to shore and very active.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>J-pod</b> came south from Kellett Bluff down the west side of San Juan Island around <b>6:30 p.m</b>. Ruffles was offshore. There was some breaching and porpoising as they came south. By the time they arrived at Land Bank (south of Lime Kiln) at about <b>8:00 p.m</b>., Ruffles was trailing most of J-pod, but was close in to shore. Ruffles was babysitting at least five of the youngsters, some of whom were having fun trying to breach on him. Ruffles began to do a lazy tail slap about every 4 surfaces. He also went kelping and came up highly decorated. The calves responded by grouping tighter together with Ruffles. When the group got to the bay just before Edwards Point, 2 to 3 adult females exploded to the surface to join the group. Very interesting.
