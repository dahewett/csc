<b>Puget Sound - 5:45 p.m. - small group of orcas passing by my house...west of mid channel slowly moving south in the pink ribbon colored water. Beautiful! J19</b> heading south this evening, taken just <b>south of Fay Bainbridge Park</b>. -Photo by Sue Larkin, October 31, 2017 
<br/>(<i>ID by Melisa Pinnow</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1737: orcas visible from hill atop Manitou beach.</b> 1 ind &amp; group of 3 initially seen heading south, then 3+ ind inc adult male changing direction east west, appear to be foraging, currently at least 1 ind <b>near Fay Bainbridge </b>heading west. -Paula von Weller

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:45 p.m. -</b> Last update from <b>Richmond Beach</b>: several stalled and foraged but in general all appear to be trending south. Trailers are two males traveling together mid channel about 1.5 miles south of Richmond Beach/Point Jefferson.  I did see another male further south with another group southwest of these males (transect Carkeek and Faye Bainbridge) Lots of directional changes and foraging all afternoon as they slowly make their way down the Sound. Saw at least 2 calves today as well. Too far and backlit for IDs.
<br/><b>5:00 p.m. - Trailing groups about at Point Jefferson/Richmond Beach</b> mid channel moving southwesterly. Breaches further south out from Port Madison, while others foraging in different directions trailers approach. Many shiny fins and illuminated exhalations as I look west in the golden light over a calm glimmering Puget Sound backdropped by the slightly veiled Olympic Mountain Range.
<br/><b>4:22 p.m. - </b><b></b>in general I think most have continued south spread in all directions but mainly mid channel with mist more west but some east of mid. Trailers include 2 loosely spread groups one adult male and female in each with one calf and one juvie rounding out the two. At least two males and one female still out from Kingston dock/south of Point Wells mid channel foraging.
<br/>3:42 p.m - nice tail lob Apple Tree Cove south of Kingston dock
<br/><b>3:35 p.m. -  Approx 15 total so far</b>:  Leaders (6+ loosely spread) south of Kingston, pod of approx 4 with male mid channel off <b>Apple Cove Point/Point Wells</b> engaged in directional changes, and even more (3-4?) to the north coming mid channel. Lots of salmon jumping all over. Years past I would say Rs based on numbers but too far for IDs for me anyhow.
<br/><b>3:27 p.m. - Seen at least 2 adult males.</b> Currently what is trailing group consists of at least four including male, still north of <b>Apple Cove Point </b>in Ferry lanes mid channel steady southbound. Other group north of Kingston Ferry dock west side of channel. There was a male in lead group earlier
<br/><b>3:18 p.m. - </b><b></b>still streaming in from north. Have seen some directional changes over the past 45 minutes. In general from <b>south of Apple Cove Point </b><b></b>and to the north and mid channel and west of. Few spread out north of Kingston with two other groups north by 1/2 mile and even further All southbound at the moment
<br/><b>2:30 p.m. -</b><b></b> seeing spread out orcas. One group still <b>north of Apple Cove Point </b>mid channel steady <b>southbound</b><b></b> another trailing maybe 1/4-1/2 mile. Viewing from Richmond Beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:03 p.m. - 4 Orcas just south of Apple Cove Point heading south</b>, closer to Kingston side. -Darlene Moneypenny

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:00 p.m. -</b> Watching from the Kitsap side, Sara Frey reports seeing several groups of orcas, at least ten total, <b>some near Edmonds and some further south at the tank farm, and some closer to the Kitsap side, all trending south. J17 southbound Puget Sound passing Apple Cove Point, Kingston. Two unidentified southern residents passing Apple Cove Point, Kingston, backdropped by Point Wells, Woodway ("the Tank Farm") on their travels southbound.</b> -Photo by Sara Frey, October 31, 2017
<br/>(<i>ID by Melisa Pinnow</i>)

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:19 p.m. - 6+ Orcas passing Eglon headed south</b> right now. They were mid channel, and yes just north of Kingston. After watching them for a bit there was at least a half dozen. (originally reported as 3-4). -Melissa Peterson

October 31 - Juan de Fuca - Northbound Victoria Clipper spotted <b>Js milling, trending west, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> near the border, around <b>10am</b> this morning. No photos, but three of the crew who are familiar with the whales, including one of our naturalists, were confident that <b>J26 Mik</b>e in a group of at least 12 whales. (AIS map location was near Hein Bank - ALB). -Stephanie Raymond

October 31 - Strait of Georgia - <b>11:42 a.m. - </b>Initially quite far more than five miles w <b>two at least heading south</b>. Most recently one humpback still here and closer <b>3-5 miles from shore between Mayne and PT Roberts</b>. 
<br/><b>11:20 a.m. - Several humpbacks active in the Strait of Georgia </b>over last hour. Visible from Mayne Island BC. Beautiful flukes in various places. Busy foraging. They appeared to be in the middle of the Straight but maybe between 5 and 10 miles from Mayne island. -Yves Tiberghien

Dolphins - October 31 - I saw them this evening off of <b>Mee-Ka-Mooks Park in West Seattle around 5:45pm</b>. They didn't seem to be traveling, just milling around in the same area. -Brian-Nicole Jenkins

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

The project at the <b>Seattle ferry terminal</b> will be pile driving today. We are checking the OrcaNet twitter site a few times a day when we do. Today we saw<b> 2 bottlenose dolphin travelling south in front of the ferry terminal</b> about 100 meters off the pier. No work was occurring at the time. We have 9 marine mammal monitors (10 with me) on-site and are following both a NMFS approved marine mammal monitoring plan and a USFWS marbled murrelet monitoring plan depending on the activity. This is an on-going project expected to go on about 4 years with work occurring between August 1 and Feb. 15 of any year. We appreciate any "heads up" of marine mammals we can get from OrcaNetwork. -Burt Miller, WSF/Assistant Environmental Manager

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

A pair of<b> unidentified dolphins</b> sighted by an observer near main ferry terminal in Seattle around 0800 Tuesday 31st. <b>Possibly bottlenose.</b> Were milling then began traveling in the <b>direction of Alki/Luna point</b>. No photos obtained. -Paula von Weller

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I think I may have spotted the <b>two bottle nose dolphins</b> that have been hanging around. This shot was taken from<b> Lagoon Point at about 1030 a.m</b>. -Photo by Bob VonDrachek, October 30, 3017

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:59 p.m. -</b> Think we just saw it (<b>bottlenose</b>) off Ebeys landing! -Nikkie Acres

October 29 -<b> 8:20 am. - Bottlenose Dolphin</b> close to shore by <b>Lagoon Point, Whidbey Island</b>, moving quickly north. -Margaret Marshall

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

I saw him (re: M Marshal <b>bottlenose</b> above) close up (<b>0800</b> on Sunday) about 75 ft off shore heading north at<b> Lagoon Point</b>. In the distance I thought it must be a dolphin of some kind but when he got close to the beach the size convinced me that he was a small whale even though it did not look like any I knew of. -Bob VonDrachek

Unidentified cetaceans - October 30 - We saw a group of <b>at least 5 milling about</b> just before sunset last night. They eventually headed south. Location was just<b> south of Point Whitehorn, Birch Bay</b>, they were easily seen from shore. No photos unfortunately. Sorry, not sure at all they were bottlenose. It was just before sunset so it was too dark to pick out features, but they were definitely larger than any porpoise we have observed previously. (in response to Bottlenose dolphin post - ALB). -Patty Crawley Campbell

We sighted a single Minke whale swimming west and then north around 9 am Sunday morning, October 29th, 2017. Amazing!

October 28 - Strait of Georgia - <b>Humpback Whales (2) at 9:20 am in Georgia Strait. Had 2 Humpback Whales viewed off the BC Ferries they were travelling slow and fluking and feeding and heading towards Galiano.</b> Exact GPS coordinates 48.946705,-123.256295. -Melissa Hafting

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 28 - San Juan Channel - We were with the <b>two humpbacks Heather (BCY0160) and Crater (BCXukKeta2014#1) heading South in San Juan Channel</b> towards the end of the island and heard one give a small trumpet<b> around 5:00 pm</b>. I wonder if they could hear that the other humpbacks were being harassed by orcas? Maybe they were coming to help. -Colleen Moore

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 28 - Juan de Fuca Strait - We just are heading back to <b>Anacortes now and spotted 2 humpback whales and at least 2 orca in the same area at 4:30. </b>(map shared indicate <b>south Hein Bank are</b>a). No direction, but the orca was clearly interacting with the humpbacks. As we left the <b>2 humpback and 2 orcas heading east, we spotted one more orca heading west in the direction of the humpbacks. The rolling around with their pectoral fins in the air sometimes, is correct. We thought possible feeding too, but the orca whales would periodically swim right to the humpbacks and then their would be huge splash. It looked like the orcas were attacking the humpbacks. The sound of the humpbacks are pretty remarkable (heard in the video). The humpbacks would sometimes just float it seemed for a while with their backs out of the water, staying stationary and then the orcas would periodically come up as if they were circling the humpbacks. We watched for an hour and it was the same thing the whole time. Humpbacks surfacing, staying pretty stationary with some rolling and showing pectoral fins, the two orcas coming out of  the water periodically in what seemed like a circle around the humpbacks, and a rare (maybe 3 times in the hour we were there) the orcas swimming directly to the humpbacks with a lot of splash when they contacted. Pretty remarkable to watch. Thanks for all the work you do, Orca Network.</b>
<br/>Narrative w/YouTube video:
<br/>Two humpbacks spotted around 4:30pm in what first appeared to be them feeding, but then spotted two orcas circling the humpbacks. Periodically, the two orcas would swim right to the humpbacks and then their would be huge splash. It looked like the orcas were attacking the humpbacks. The sound of the humpbacks trumpeting is pretty remarkable (heard in the video). The humpbacks would sometimes just float it seemed for a while with their backs out of the water, staying stationary while other times rolling and showing their pectoral fins. For the hour we were there, almost on repeat: Humpbacks surfacing, staying pretty stationary with some rolling and showing pectoral fins, the two orcas coming out of  the water periodically in what seemed like a circle around the humpbacks, and a rare (maybe 3 times in the hour we were there) the orcas swimming directly to the humpbacks with a lot of splash when they contacted. Not sure if the orcas were attacking or just harassing the humpbacks. Pretty remarkable to watch. - Emma Hawkins

What a surprise to come rolling along the edge of<b> Wilby Shoals (south end of Quadra Island) late this afternoon to find J pod foraging</b> in typical spread out formation! We had minimal time as the sun had just dipped below the mountains and pics were getting hard to take! But we managed a few ID's, J26, J38, to confirm J pod and love the Sunset colors! -Photo by Nick Templeman, October 27, 2017

It's not too often we see whale watch boats (and whales) from home, but we lucked out today when the <b>T137As</b> made a foray into <b>Holmes Harbor</b>. We first spotted the whales <b>passing Hidden Beach, Greenbank</b>, watched vigilantly by a bald eagle perched on high, and caught up with them again later at Honeymoon Bay as they headed out towards Saratoga Passage. We enjoyed the bonus of warm, sunny weather accompanying the tranquility of nature in the wild, a far cry from the turbulence of the world and a gentle reminder of the true meaning of life. (photo of male <b>T137A</b> (born 2002) in Holmes Harbor by Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

<b>4:45 p.m. - Orcas in Holmes Harbor</b>. Spotted three (maybe four) orcas including one small juvenile <b>heading out of Holmes Harbor </b>going north past Baby Island. Two impressive breaches by the biggest orca in the group. -Kat Johnson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:00-3:45 p.m. - They were in Holmes Harbor</b>, Freeland, Wa. We live at 1400 block Everette Ln, Freeland Wa. When we heard one of our neighbors say "orca", we grabbed the binoculars and headed down to our beach off the spit. There were <b>3 fins sighted</b>, but none large enough to be  male. At least 1 was quite small. They appeared to be playing...lots of surfacing but no breaching. There were 2 boats, small whale watching as opposed to fishing/crabbing. They were following the Orcas. We were aware of them at about 3 and watched them until about 3:45pm. -Bruce and Beverly Hardcastle

<b>2:00 p.m. -</b> My husband and I were out on our stand up paddle boards near the boat ramp in<b> Holmes Harbor</b>. Around 2 PM we saw 2 Harbor seals, then 5 small porpoises (they were dark gray or black on top). My husband heard what sounded like gravel being dumped from a truck, only to look up and realize it was an <b>Orca</b> swimming. At this point I turned and saw <b>2-3 Orcas</b>. I saw their backs and dorsal fins then went down in the water and we didn't see them after that. The Orcas were on the right side of <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, if you are looking out at the water from Freeland Park. They were between the sailboats and the larger metal dock along on the right. -Tannis Rhoton

<br/><b>4:10 p.m. -</b> saw breaching lobtailing etc still south of traffic buoy but trending slowly north mid channel. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:45 p.m. - </b>seeing some of the orcas closer to the Whidbey side, <b>about a mile south of Bush Pt.</b> still foraging but still trending NW I believe...
<br/><b>5:00 p.m. -</b> there are still some orcas way down <b>off the green channel marker</b>, others spread out NW of there, and swimming in every direction possible, looks like they are having dinner! 
<br/>4:40 p.m. - there are more further SE, closer to <b>Point No Point</b>, definite foraging, direction changes, lunges, tail lobs - hope they are finding, sharing and eating a lot of salmon!
<br/><b>4:35 p.m. - seeing the orcas between Hansville (Kitsap side) and Double Bluff (Whidbey side)</b>, look to be closer to Hansville. They are trending NW up Admiralty Inlet, but still look like they are foraging - some lobtailing and direction changes. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:14 p.m. -</b> Now <b>south of Double Bluff </b>in the northbound traffic lane. -Jason Mihok

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:06 p.m. -</b> wow! I just happened to swing the big eyes around, trying to spot more blows and fins, and saw this big black thing hanging horizontally in the air over the water - then SPLASH as the whale landed! Just happened to catch it mid-breach!
At 3 pm we were just able to spot them with our "big eyes" - looks like they are foraging, multidirectional still <b>south of the green channel marker, spread out in the Possession Triangle</b>, hopefully finding lots of fish! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Humpback whales - October 17 - Puget Sound - <b>4:20 p.m. -</b> While scouting for resident orcas, who were miles away towards the <b>entrance to Admiralty Inlet, a humpback</b> came into view in my binoculars.

My orca sighting today took place from around<b> 4:20-5:40</b> and I <b>started viewing at Constellation but as the orcas headed north I moved to Alki. At around 5:20 it became clear that some of the orcas were moving into Elliot Bay</b>. The orcas were very spread out the entire time so it is hard for me to know how many there were without looking at the other reports. The funny thing is that I came to Alki in the hopes of seeing the residents after having given a presentation to a class of third graders about these same orcas. -Connor O'Brien

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:40 p.m. -</b> Orcas under an orca cloud! After much foraging out from Discovery Park these two groups anyhow have now committed themselves southbound. Last seen in the distance about 2:40 skirting Elliot Bay heading towards Alki/Restoration Point. This place we live, sublime.
<br/><b>2:00 p.m. - </b> The two groups here have <b>stalled &amp; turned back and are foraging just south of the lighthouse</b>; one group just east of yellow mid channel buoy off West Point and another group south of and more east side of channel. Lots of big boys!
<br/><b>1:45 p.m. - </b>ON volunteer Jennifer Hammer and I moved to<b> West Point Lighthouse/Discovery Park</b>. Here but just a few minutes when she spots orcas coming around the point. We watched this family/group tightly grouped up round the point about a 1/4 mile offshore in lovely October winds and heavy chop. We are watching another group who is due west of Lighthouse mid channel, with one member breaching at least 3 times at least. All steady southbound powering along. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

A lot of males. And hundreds and hundreds of gulls!
<br/><b>10:45 a.m. - </b>I see several spread out north/south and across channel. At least one group including adult male south of Kingston Ferry west of mid channel, with others just north of Ferry dock including at least one male.

We were with<b> J pod and L pod</b> with one of the first boats on seen and my wife got this picture. She thinks the larger orca is <b>J35 Tahlequah</b> with possibly a new baby. The larger whale logged on the surface for approx. 5 minutes and this is what brought the tiny fin to be seen. She was taking ID photos and saw it. Taken 10-15-2017 @ 1 pm  -Brian Goldberg
<br/><i>ID notes from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Hello, Thanks for sending the photos.  After a close look at the pics, I believe the whales in them are <b>J17</b> (based on fin shape) and <b>J53</b> (based on size and fin shape). We did not photograph these two whales from our boat that day so it is great that you got photos. J53 does look very small sometimes (she fakes us out too) and Fall lighting can sometimes make whales look a little more orange than normal. But keep looking as this is the time of year when new calves could well show up! A new J pod calf would be very tiny, skinny,very orange, and probably glued to mom's side.One of these days we will get another one!  Thanks again for the photos."</i>

<b>J pod and the L54s</b> came in today! (Id from Dave at CWR) Chum salmon are currently running. The whales did lots of foraging today, which is always awesome to see. They went <b>up the west side</b>, foraging as they went, milled and foraged <b>in the middle of Haro Strait</b> before coming back to the San Juan Island shoreline and then south. (for now) Will be curious to see if they stick around here, head back out to the Pacific, or head up north to the Fraser River. Beautiful day out there today! -Traci Walter

Unidentified killer whales - Hi would like to report whale sightings: Oct 15th had <b>2 Orcas and a few Harbour Porpoises feeding off Cecil Green Park at UBC in Vancouver at 3:30pm.</b> 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Oct 15th had <b>2 Orcas off the end of the south jetty at Iona Regional Park in Richmond BC at 5pm</b>. All whales were seen far off shore with spotting scopes by several of us together. -Melissa Hafting

<b>5:48 p.m. - humpback.</b>.. 30 tail slaps and a breach!!! Love this
<br/><b>5:30 p.m. - humpback spotted one mile north of Kingston ferry terminal</b>. -Darlene Moneypenny

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

3:58 p.m. -  Two Spot is slowly making his way towards Apple Tree Cove, we watched him breach and then pec wave, now he seems to be resting Southwest from Possesion Point. Tim and I went out on our boat this afternoon and found our favorite <b>humpback Two Spot (CS631) near Possession Point</b>. We hung out with the big guy for a bit while he explored the rip tide, then he saw a bird pile in the distance between Possession Point and Edmonds. We were shut down and ready with our cameras thinking he might lunge feed but surprise, he breached!! Then he tail lobbed and cartwheeled. -Janine Harles

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:05 p.m - Spotted just west of Possession Point mid channel</b>. We have the white boat with green Bimini top. -Robert Bjeletich

October 14 - Puget Sound - <b>1:10 p.m. - humpback still feeding in general area a couple miles south of Cultus Bay, South Whidbey</b>. Could see him rise up lunge feeding amongst the swirl of the gulls. From Haines Wharf, Edmonds. Side note: showed some birders the whale then we all just watched a Peregrine falcon hunting then successfully strike and eat a pigeon on the wharf. Much wildlife all around to take in. I'm leaving now.
<br/><b>12:20 p.m. -  Humpback and gulls still feeding approx 2 miles south of Cultus Bay</b> (between Scatchet and Possession pt) Humback going back and forth in very tight area. Cool to watch. Now from Stamm Overlook Park. 
<br/><b>12:05 p.m. -  Whale </b>and hundreds of gulls more to the east now of my previous report. Blows rising right in the middle of all them circling gulls. Must be good eats.
<br/><b>11:45 a.m. - observed several tall blows and they arch of what presuming to be the humpback south of green buoy off Scatchet Head</b>, South Whidbey. Too far to discern direction of travel. As viewed from Sunset Ave just north of Edmonds Ferry. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Humpback whales - October 13 - Puget Sound - <b>9:40 a.m. - CS631 Two Spot milling in current line off Possession Point</b>. Not diving. Frequent surface intervals. -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Unidentified cetaceans - October 13 - <b>1:00 p.m. - Humpback? Milling off North Beach, Port Townsend</b>. Watched it about 30 minutes. Looked to be<b> northerly of Point Wilson</b>. Perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 miles out. Made several 10-15 minutes transits. Back and forth along a ~se/sw line. Submerging as long as ~5 minutes. No tail flukes.... Good question. That's why I "question marked" humpback in my op. Too far for me too positively is between hb and minke. Didn't see exhalations but very far away. I'm leaning toward minke myself. Hope you (we) find the humpback. -Rick Hatten

Dolphins - October 13 - A photo of <b>a single small cetacean seen heading north from Pier 69</b> in Seattle was shown to Fred Felleman today about 4:30.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We are at the <b>Edgewater hotel in Seattle</b>, and while enjoying treats and looking out the window we had what I am sure is <b>a dolphin swim by</b>. It was really close. We tried to take a picture but sun glare and age of phone prevented a quality dorsal image. The folks sitting around us said that he/she has made several passes this afternoon. We saw him/her about <b>3:45</b>. -Kendal Holmes Berry

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Relaying this info from another observer: @ <b>3:10pm unidentified dolphin</b> was milling nearshore off<b> Myrtle Edwards beach</b>, no distinct direction of travel. This same individual has been spotted by 3 different observers within our group working around the bay <b>since approx 10:00am this morning</b>. It has changed direction multiple times<b> between pier 66 and 70</b> during the past few hours. -Paula von Weller

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:26 p.m. -</b> Still out there! Cruising back and forth (north south)
<br/><b>12:42 p.m. - </b>still working the shoreline along <b>pier 70</b>. Making trips both north and south. Close to shore!
<br/><b>11:33 a.m - Pretty sure the dolphin from this morning is now passing pier 70/downtown Seattle</b>. Single fin, no signs saddle markings (which is why I think its the dolphin from earlier). -Troy Hightower

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:24 a.m. -</b> Now swimming adjacent to <b>Myrtle Edwards park </b>just below the PI globe. -Dorothy Hanson Harris

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:38 a.m. -</b> almost to bath house still very close to show shore. I think this is actually the bottlenose. Fairly certain this was the <b>bottlenose</b>. Got one decent look at its head and the beak looked awfully blunt for a common dolphin. Didn't see any of yellow the commons have and I've never seen them alone before. When I first spotted it I thought it was a small orca. Sorry I didn't get any pictures, my phone camera died.
<br/><b>8:32 a.m. - eastbound of north side of Alki Beach</b> about 50 yards off beach. Straight out from Cactus.
<br/><b>8:18 a.m. - nearing Alki Point</b> again northbound about 100 yards off shore.
<br/><b>8:16 a.m. - </b>lots of direction changes, appears to be hunting off Constellation Park.

<b>Fin whale - </b>For the third year in a row, a rare fin whale has been spotted in the Salish Sea,<b> just north of Port Angeles</b>. Our naturalist, Sam, was able to snag a few identifying shots (below) while observing nearby humpback whales (this <b>afternoon</b>). In September 2015, a lone fin whale was spotted repeatedly in the area. That was the first live sighting of a fin whale in the Salish Sea since 1930. Last year, a different fin whale was located in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and remained for several months, making it all the way down to south Puget Sound. Based on the photos, this third whale is a juvenile and does not match the 2015 or 2016 whales. Could these "Fall Fins" be a new trend? Fin whales can reach lengths of 70+ feet when fully grown and are the second longest whales in the world. Researchers have been alerted and we'll be keeping an eye out from both our Anacortes and Port Angeles locations. Fingers crossed we are able to spot this rare visitor again! -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures WW

Southern Residents - It was a Salish Sea hat trick this evening at <b>Lime Kiln - a couple of humpback whales, lots of Dall's porpoise, and a distant view of J-Pod</b>. It's always a good day when you can see three different cetacean species, but especially in October and especially in high winds! (Js to the SW of Lime Kiln, mostly way offshore, looked like they flipped and were <b>southbound at 18:30</b>). -Monika Wieland Shields

Bigg's/Transient killer whales - October 10 - Puget Sound - Out on Chilkat this morning and right away we encountered the <b>T100B's and T087</b>! Missed the shots but they started off making a kill, harbor seal, the seal was tossed in the air, and displayed many times. After, it became the T87 and T100B1 show! They played and wrestled together for over two hours! Mom and baby were there but they stayed pretty far away, whereas these two stayed by us! T100B1 even made a close pass to the boat, swimming alongside us and checking us out!! Tail lobs, cartwheels, spy hops, partial breaches and a double spyhop snuggle fest!! Towards the end of the tour we saw a submarine and found the entangled humpback! We couldn't stay with the HB long but we contacted NOAA and Orca Network, got pictures, but could not verify if the whale was still entangled or not. <b>7 year-old T100B1 and adult male T87 (est. born 1962) making close contact. </b>(<b>the group continued north in Admiralty</b> - ALB) -Janine Harles 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:51 a.m. - T100Bs and T87 just north of Kingston</b> right now milling after killing a harbor seal. Here are a few photographs of our amazing experience with <b>T87 and the T100Bs</b> after they made a harbor seal kill <b>just offshore from Edmond</b>s on Oct 10. Just the day before, Renee Beitzel and I <b>noticed the underside of T100B1 and could easily see that he was a very excited boy</b> (if you know what I mean;). Today he gave us additional ventral views showing that he's a boy while he played with much larger, T87. T100B1 and big T87 spent almost our entire visit with them just playing with each other while T100B and T100B2 were off on their own! I've never seen such an old male (est. birth 1962) playing with a young boy for so long (some major bro time)! It was really fun to watch! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist Chilkat Express.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:00 a.m. - orcas</b> are still there, along with the Chilkat,<b> north of Apple Cove Point</b>. I think there are <b>4 orcas,</b> including one male.
<br/><b>10:30 a.m. -</b>  lots of birds hovering above the orcas, on a kill?
<br/><b>10:25 a.m. - 3 orcas mid channel just north of Apple Cove Point (Kingston)</b>. A few hundred yards north of the Chilkat, which is pointed south away from the orcas. Orcas are just milling about. -Sherman Page

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 10 - Admiralty Inlet -<b> 3:22 p.m -</b>  Volunteer Sandra Pollard went out to try and keep locate and keep eyes on the whale from the beach. She walked <b>Double Bluff beach</b> and did observe blows directionally towards and a bit<b> south of Point No Point</b> but could not confirm if it was a humpback let alone the entangled juvenile. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:50 p.m. - </b>Received a call from Janine Harles aboard the Chilkat that they had located <b>the entangled juvenile humpback off Double Bluff</b>. They were with the whale<b> until about 2:15</b>, leaving her/him close to Whidbey heading easterly into Useless Bay. 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 10 - At<b> 4:45pm heard the unmistakable sound of a large whale in Case Inlet between Harstine Island and Key Peninsula</b>, just south of Herron Island. Never saw it, so no idea of type or direction. Sure sounded like a single Humpback though; a few long evenly spaced breaths followed by about a 3-5 minutes of silence. So keep your eyes out. It's quite possible it was the dolphin. It may have sounded larger if it came closer into my bay here than the humpbacks have in the past, and would have been harder to spot in the chop we had that day. -Dave Berliner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 10 - <b>8:42 a.m. - Pilot whales between PT (Port Townsend) and Marrowstone Island</b>. Square head 15' long, not a orca or dolphins. Just one and headed east. No pictures. Seen them the last 3 mornings here. The blocky or square head really stood out to me. Very distinctive to me. -Luke Schwantes

The <b>SRKWs were off waters near Comox, BC </b>on Oct 8. I <b>also saw them on Oct 3 and 4</b>. And heard <b>they were in Johnston Strait on Oct 2</b>. There were no reports from Oct 5 to 7. Lifeforce Ocean Friends was not on the water at that time so our studies did not cover the Comox area. Today they were doing the same travel patterns. They were foraging and socializing. They did  not seem to be in hurry to leave this area to head further south. -Peter Hamilton

October 8 - Juan de Fuca Strait - What a way to end our 2017 season, wow, <b>Transient/Biggs killer whales - the T046Bs traveling with U39</b> (U designation means not enough information known about this whale - yet), amazing Dall's porpoise riding our bow, harbor porpoise doing tail-slaps, awesome Steller sea lions, harbor seals, bald eagles, and free ice cream! Can't get much better than that! Huge thanks to Capt Monte and Capt Eric for their diligence in finding so much wildlife today, it was an exceptional way to finish the season. (additonal notes: whales were north of Salmon Bank, towards Hein Bank, Dall's were more easterly as we were heading home, and porpoise were as we were crossing Rosario Strait. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

After a hard day at work, Tim picked me up at the fuel dock and we went out to find <b>2 humpback whales</b> that had been spotted near <b>Kingston</b>. We didn't find them, but I was watching an Orca Network post about <b>transients</b> that had turned South. We started heading that way and <b>spotted them near Picnic Point.</b> They took a sharp turn towards Possession (Point) so we hung back and watched them travel. They had split into two groups and suddenly they started porpoising towards our boat! We shut down and watched as the porpoise swam past with T87 right on it's tail. They finally all porpoised past us and then played with the Harbor Porpoise for at least 25 minutes! When they decided to eat the birds showed up, T087 swam a little ways away as the <b>T100B's</b> celebrated their kill! At one point it seemed like they may have had 2 porpoise, still not sure. We left them about an hour later as they turned South and last saw them <b>heading South past Apple Tree Cove</b>.
<br/><b>5:01 p.m. - T087 and T100B's made a kill off Possession</b>, harbor porpoise, possibly more than one as the kill took about 25 minutes before they ate! They are now headed South mid channel, kind of angling east a bit.

<b>1:51 p.m. - Possession Sound. North of the Mukilteo ferry</b>, SE of the Clinton ferry, and SW of Hat Island. There's a S-shaped current by the sailboats - they are just SW of it. Looking like more like 5-6 Orcas.

Dolphin - October 6 - <b>Single smallish mammal with curved dorsal heading south into Eld</b> being followed by a seal. It is approximately<b> 8 feet long</b>. When I first saw the fin, I was in the house and looked over my shoulder just as it was slicing through the water...going down. I thought it was a sea lion flipper. Then I saw a seal's head and thought it might have been that.  Then it surfaced again. I ran to the deck and was able to see it surface again right near shore, and the seal was sort of following it.  It was heading south, and continued to go into Eld Inlet. I lost sight of it in the shadows of Cooper Point. It has quite a robust blow and surfaces quickly. -Kim Merriman

Saratoga Passage - Hi! <b>Lone orca</b><b></b> sighting yesterday, October 6th @  <b>9.59 am in my "backyard" directly between Camano Island &amp; Baby Island</b>.

I live right above the most northern point of Camano State Park &amp; it looked like she had been in the kelp bed directly below me &amp; then headed a little toward Baby Island &amp; then north in the Passage.

October 6 - On a chilly, damp morning, we left the marina with no word of cetaceans, and headed north through the San Juan Islands to stay in the calmer water. After enjoying the antics of some exotic deer and an eagle on Spieden Island, we moved northwest into Haro Strait, encountering choppy seas. Capt. Eric spotted<b> a tail lobbing juvenile humpback just west of Spieden, around Turn Point</b>. He/she tail lobbed at least ten times, then did a half breach pretty close to the boat. The whale then moved off and started doing long down times and barely breaking the surface when he/she exhaled. Upon examination of photos (please excuse the out-of-focus photo!), we saw <b>this young whale has a net or something else in it's mouth and down the sides</b>. Orca Network contacted NOAA, and hopefully they will be able to find him/her again and help get the gear off. We took a lovely tour of Flat Top and Jones Island, checking some harbor seals, then headed home. As our season ends, I am very grateful to the Mystic Sea team, our lovely passengers, and our beautiful wildlife we are so lucky to share a home with. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

October 3 - Haro Strait - We had our 60th (!!) transient encounter of the season this afternoon in <b>Haro Strait</b> with an unusual grouping of <b>6 whales: the T65Bs, T123s, and T65A2</b>. It was very cool to directly compare the size of 13 year-old male T65A2 (front) to that of 17 year-old male T123A (behind). Whether they were doing it because it felt good or because they were looking for seals I will never know, but it was pretty cool to see transient killer whales swim right through the kelp bed off Mandarte Island.

October 2 - North Puget Sound - <b>5:54 p.m. - Humpback breach by Kingston ferry</b> just now! -Andrea Leigh

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We found <b>Two Spot</b> right after leaving the dock in Edmonds, he was across the way by the<b> Kingston ferry dock</b>. He was doing tail lobs and cartwheels, right side up and upside down, and he just kept doing them! The Kingston ferry even had to stop as Two Spot was tail lobbing in front of the dock! Lots of pics but so fun to watch! <b>After Two Spot we found T087 and the T100B's just North of Port Townsend!</b> -Janine Harles

<b>A member of the T100Bs in Elliot Bay with research boat. </b>- returning to Elliott Bay Marina after a brief sail over to Bainbridge, <b>16:00</b>, Oct 1, 2017. Noticed <b>one Orca</b> swimming a few hundred yards south of the Elliott Bay Marina breakwater. Followed from a respectful distance of 300-400 yards. Ultimately saw a group of we believe to be three Orcas. One looked like a male. They were in transit. Left Elliott Bay and turned north up the Puget Sound. They were following the ship channel. Maybe they like deep water. They were being shadowed by a small research boat with two persons on board. Assume this sighting has aready been well documented, but posting anyway. Hope it helps. 47.37.121 N / 122.23.572 W. -Robert Williams

October 1 - FORTUNATELY, we have now also for sure seen orcas!  The next morning (10/1 around<b> 8 a.m.</b>) We spotted a small pod milling about what must have been<b> Mutiny Bay</b><b></b> over along Whidbey, using binoculars and a spotting scope from Hansville.  They must have been splitting up because a little later we saw two traveling SE mid channel between Point No Point and Whidbey, and then only saw one of the males (huge dorsal - maybe 6 feet tall with a slight curve at the very top) passing much closer to Point No Point, continuing south. Thanks for all the info and tracking! -Rod Lundberg
<br/>(<i>Presumably<b> T87 and T100Bs </b>who were ID'd later off Possession Point - ALB</i>)

From my vantage point from the house (slightly <b>north of Apple Cove) the humpback</b> initially was moving south and changed direction north around 930 am. -Darlene Moneypenny

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" viewed by many aboard the Edmonds/Kingston ferry this morning.</b> Saw this <b>humpback off of the Puyallup Ferry coming into Kingston</b> at about<b> 9:15 this morning</b>. From the ferry I saw the Victoria clipper hauling north near Kingston... at one point it stopped dead in the water so I figured it was a whale sighting, as our ferry approached Kingston they announced a humpback sighting on the left side of the boat. I was already on that side on the deck. I missed the initial breach he did right next to the boat but he continued with tail slaps...-Laurie Eickhoff Ascanio

Minke whales - October 1 - With a little more taste of fall in the air while still enjoying calm, clear weather, Mystic Sea left the dock to meander along Lopez Island shoreline towards Whale Rocks where a large number of Steller sea lions were hauled out, some dozy, some not so dozy. After venturing into more open water beyond Salmon Bank, we turned towards <b>Smith and Minor Aquatic Reserve</b> to follow up on a Minke whale report and were not disappointed. Although known to be somewhat elusive, we spotted the <b>'Stinky Minke'</b> surfacing among the abundance of floating bull-kelp before continuing on our way to take a closer look at the many Harbor seals taking time out on the rocks and beaches around the reserve. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 1 -<b> 2:03 p.m. - Just saw what looks like a single false killer whale or bottle nose</b> (similar looking to what was spotted off of Kingston) on the <b>north side of Raft Island</b> (south Puget Sound in Carr Inlet). It was well over ten feet long, dark grey in coloring, and had a more pronounced dorsal fin than a harbor or Dall's porpoise. Definitely not an orca. It was surfacing about every two minutes along the shore. -Kaitlyn Goodeve

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

October 1 - I was out on <b>Henderson Bay</b> on 10/1,  and got to row next to this solitary creature moving purposefully southward through the bay. I don't think it's an orca, but I know it's not a harbor porpoise, either.  It was zigzagging back-and-forth, like a feeding Harbor porpoise, surfacing for 3 to 5 breaths before submerging for a while. I'd say it was about 10-15 feet long. What did I see? -Thank you for any insights,  Oliver Kuhn-Wilken

Unidentified cetaceans - October 1st weekend - (This report in response to October 13th sighting of a bottlenose dolphin in Elliot Bay. Possible these were the pod of common dolphins who have stayed in Puget Sound (or even harbor porpoise) as all reports have been of just a lone bottlenose). I was curious because I recently saw a pod of them in Colvos Passage, off of the NW side of Vashon. Pretty sure they were bottle nosed as well (two weeks ago). Thanks for responding!
<br/>(after further discussion) I'm not certain of the timing but it was around the weekend of 10/1. At least 4 is my guess and they were heading north. It was the first I had ever seen them and they were playful, dipping in and out of the water. There was a similar sighting of an Orca pod in the same area the day before Labor Day and at first I thought it was Orca again, but they were far smaller in scale and grey. I noticed their square snouts." -Emily Raymond
