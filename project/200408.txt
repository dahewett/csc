<h3><center>August 2004 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>August 31, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
We spotted a small group of <b>transients</b> (4 individuals) just west of Active Pass, near Enterprise Reef, at about <b>10:00</b>. This was probably the same group sighted by Peter Reiner at <b>0940</b> in Trincomali Channel. We observed them making one pass through the kelp bed at Enterprise Reef, then grouping together for what appeared to be resting behavior. This group was seen a short time later by another whale watching boat as they meandered Eastbound through Active Pass. I was hoping that someone with more experience observing transients might be able to help me ID the group. It appeared to be a family group led by a female with a dorsal fin that was very wide at the base, and very triangular (similar to T69's). I didn't get a close enough look at the fin to note if there was damage on it. With this female was what appeared to be a sprouting male.

We received a call from Elana Slater reporting a pod of 5 - 6 <b>orcas</b> in Penn Cove off Whidbey Island this morning at <b>7:15 am</b>. She said they were near the Coupeville Wharf, heading out of the cove toward N. Camano Island. 
<br/>*<br/>
I live on possession sound, whidbey island side--about a mile from possession point. I was walking north yesterday and heard a loud snort, looking out I saw an upright black fin and a spout of water. I can say pretty definately they were not porposies because of the fin, but i am not 100% thay they were orcas because form the angle I was at I could not see white spots and because I couldnt believe I was seeing this far south this time of year. I  watched for a while and I saw two fins-- they appeared to be  staying close to the surface because I only saw one tail once.
<br/>They surfaced 6-8 times, Because the fin was long I am pretty sure they were orcas.   It was around <b>noon</b> and I assume they were feeding, because they were close in to shore and the tide was low. I  was walking farther out than the average tide and they appeared to be just 3-4 hundred feet off shore.   Once they left what we refer to as the cove (an area north of my cabin that has five cabins -- the beach also angles out towards the sound and the next
landmark is glendale pier) they appeared to dive deeper and did not resurface in my view.

<br/>*<br/>
As we got a bit closer, it looked like a possible greeting ceremony, but instead it was <b>J's &amp; K's</b> in a long line in a resting pattern. Later in the afternoon from shore, we observed the whales slowly moving north towards Lime Kiln. But they didn't make it much past there as they never appeared near the county park.

We have our own whale report today - we watched what looked like all or most of the <b>Southern Residents</b> traveling north &amp; south at the same time, from Land Bank on the west side of San Juan Island at around <b>3 pm</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
We heard from Kristen Burgess who is also up on San Juan Island this week, that this morning at <b>4 am</b> she woke up to the sound of <b>orcas</b> breathing, &amp; watched them in the moonlight from where she they were staying on Hannah Heights. 
<br/>*<br/>
A group of 4 <b>transients</b> passed by the southern entrance to Active Pass this morning at <b>0940</b>. They were travelling west up Trincomali Channel, about 300m away from Helen Point on Mayne Island and then about the same distance from Collinson Point on Galiano. There was a bit of spyhopping, but mostly they were on the move. They paid no attention to the resident harbour seal rookery in Georgeson Bay, even though the tide was low and there were about 40 seals lolling about on the exposed surface of nearby Collinson Reef.  Despite the proxmity of the Orcas, the seals appeared untroubled as well.
<br/>Peter B. Reiner
<br/>*<br/>
Tom Perry of Camano Island called at <b>5:55 pm</b> to report one large male <b>orca</b> (likely a transient) heading north up Saratoga Passage, 1/2 mile north of Onamac Pt. mid-passage.

...<b>L-12's</b> from yesterday were still hanging out near False Bay. We had an <b>early morning</b> charter. Mystery, Matia, Mega (hey, all "M" whales) gave us nice viewings. Later in the afternoon I heard that the L-12's were actually going UP Rosario Channel while the other 3 groups of Southern Residents were slowly coming down Rosario.

Always nice to have the <b>orcas</b> return after some foraging in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. As all 3 pods of residents approached San Juan Island on the huge flood tide, they decided to do the old west-side split, with the L-12's going from Lime Kiln towards Cattle Point, and the rest of the residents heading north. Very nice to see L-12 (Alexis) and L-78 (Gaia) as they foraged in the strong currents near False Bay. Some very loud vocalizations, and a loud bump on the hydrophone as L-78 went under the boat (a dorsal hitting the mic perhaps?)

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report a <b>gray whale</b> heading east past Race Rocks &amp; Trial Island, s. Vancouver Island at <b>6:30 pm</b>. The whale had a white area on its right side, &amp; part of its right fluke was missing.
<br/><br/>
<b>August 26, 2004</b>
<br/><br/>
A whale was reported at the mouth of Sinclair Inlet, swimming close enough to shore for her to see the blow and part of a whale fluke when it sounded. <b>Don't know what kind of whale</b>, but those of you in the Kitsap Peninsula/Bremerton/Port Orchard/Bainbrige Island area should keep your binoculars handy, &amp; let us know if you see anything out there in the fog!
<br/>*<br/>
There was a major attack on seals by the <b>T18's and T20's</b> this afternoon just north of Mandarte Is. Mark Malleson called at <b>2037</b> to report a second major attack in Oak Bay off Great Chain Is.(Victoria area). 2+ seals at least, gulls going wild.

<b>Transients</b> off Danger Shoals and the "M-pod" (<b>L12's</b>) at Cattle Point. We opted for the L12's and motored through the fog banks and rain on an absolutely mystical day. The ocean was flat with a low, slow, oily swell. No wind, only the hiss of the rain on the sea and just 5 other boats 1 mile south of the Cattle Pass entrance. Mega breached 3 times as we arrived. We saw some of the best spy hops all year and viewing was awesome with the whales showing against the featureless water/sky blend. One behavior I've never seen was 2 or 3 whales lying at the surface with just their rostrum held out of the water. The POW zod' named "The Jester" had drifted close as we all watched, the Canadian skipper and I speculated what this odd behavior was all about. I liked his idea that the whales may have just been enjoying the novelty of a hard rain on their sensitive skin.

I picked up the <b>T18's</b> with the T20's off of Victoria this morning at <b>830</b> heading east. They swam into a bait ball off of Trial and took out a seal. I heard that they killed another seal in Haro Strait near Henry Island and then took out a couple of Dall's porpoise in the afternoon. I missed all the excitement as I got sidetracked with the T11's who appeared off of Esquimalt at <b>1130</b>. I left them at <b>1400</b> off of William Head heading for Race Passage.
<br/>Cheers,
<br/>Mark Malleson

I just saw a <b>Killer Whale pod</b> (I think there were 4 or 5) swimming no
more than 100 yards from our ferry in the Strait just off Tsawwassen. They
were heading towards Active Pass. Cool.

As we rounded Eagle Point (west side of San Juan Is.), the whales could be seen near Lime Kiln Lighthouse porpoising actively down the west side, making our trip a few minutes shorter by coming towards us. As we lay quiet in the very still water with hydrophone down, we could hear a few distant vocalizations.  As the whales neared and continued porpoising by the boat, the vocalizations got quite loud, with distinct <b>J, K, and L pod calls</b>. Soon the hydrophone was picking up a literal symphony of calls. The whales had been spread out as they went by, with a few whales actually diverting course and coming over to the boats. As we floated near False Bay, we observed a lot of breaching and the vocalizations continued. As we were preparing to depart for the day, L-74 (Saanich) led a few whales by the boat and released some of the most varied bursts of echolocations and vocalizations I've heard all year. The whales appeared to be heading out towards the Salmon Bank marker when we left for the day.

As we came down the west side of San Juan Island, the <b>whales (orcas)</b> obligingly came up from Lime Kiln towards Open Bay. The whales were pretty spread out with some right on shore while others preferred to travel up to 1/2 mile or more off shore. Not much in the way of vocalizations until they were right up next to the boats, then they would vocalize briefly before becoming silent.  Today's "thing I've never seen before" behavior---one whale was near a private boat and came up to the surface upside-down and tailslapped about 30 times in a staccato manner.  Shortly after that, a large male that appeared from a distance to be L78 surfaced nearby.

Orca Network received a call this morning at <b>9 am</b> from Paavo Carroll, reporting <b>3 or 4 orcas</b> (no adult males) heading north between Coos Bay &amp; Bridgeport, <b>OR</b>, at 10 mile reef, approx. 6 miles offshore.

We had <b>J &amp; L pod</b> up North again today. Apparently K pod was also here in the AM, but they continued southbound from Point Roberts. Meanwhile, J's &amp; L's turned and headed North. We left them at about <b>4:30</b>, still headed North towards Bowen Island. Lots of socializing, great vocals. Saw one youngster (1-2 yr old) doing amazing high breaches for its small size - it was getting a little help from Mom and a sibling!

We headed up President's Channel just as the <b>L's</b> made a westward turn towards Patos Island. They split the island and rejoined together on the west side of Patos. The fog whisps added a "mysterious" air to the day as L-57 led part of the pack near the boat. Later, the whales decided to do a different play from the playbook by going from President's Channel to Speiden Channel and down the west side of San Juan Island.

We had <b>all 3 pods (less the L-12's</b>, which were headed out west in the Straits past Victoria) moving very fast down Boundary Pass towards Turn Point. They were using the outgoing tide as their own little built-in turbo boost, and were porpoising and breaching across the water. A quick turn at Turn Point and down the west side of San Juan Channel. At one point they looked as if they were going right at Discovery Island (which sometimes means they are outta here), but the J's veered away from the pack at Henry Island and slowed way down in Open Bay. After doing the "west side tour", the whales began a meandering zig-zag towards Hein Bank. Then they acted as if they were going to do a spontaneous greeting ceremony with themselves as they gathered into a very tight group. Even though we were doing vessel counts and paper work, it was hard not to steal a glance as 70 whales came up to the surface almost simultaneously and blowing all at once. The whales then turned and headed back north along San Juan Island and we headed home as the fog began to roll in. I last saw the whales once again back at Open Bay.

As you will remember, I met on the East Point rocks on Tuesday evening as we watched the whales swim by. I've had a chance to study my many photos from that swim-by and I just thought you'd like to know for your records that they were mainly L-pod whales, not Js. In fact, the only J-pod whale I can positively identify is J1, so perhaps he was "out on a date" with one of the L-pod girls! I still have to go through all the photos with the ID book, so maybe there were other Js mixed in there. Or perhaps some of the Js were in that bunch of 5-7 whales that came by about 45 mins before the main group. They were too far out for me to confirm IDs and there were no adult males.

The <b>AM</b> tour <b>J's</b> were in a resting pattern almost the entire time we were with them. They were headed north when we left them at north of Stuart Island around 1 PM.  The <b>PM</b> tour we were with <b>L's</b>. We left them near Pender also headed north around <b>5 PM</b>.

On Sunday <b>morning</b>, we walked from our guest house on North Pender Island to Thieves Bay anticipating the regular passing of a group of <b>Southern Residents</b>. We arrived to hear that a large group (10 or so) had already gone by headed north, towards Active Pass. But a few minutes later we were treated to a very close shoreline pass of ten or so more Orcas.

Cascadia ran a small-boat survey off the outer Washington coast August 15. Erin Falcone and I left Westport, headed north and west about 40 miles (out to about 16 miles offshore), then further west to about 35 miles offshore into deep water (&gt;1000 m), and back south staying in deep water. All together we covered 130+ nautical miles. We found two groups of humpbacks both 10 or more miles offshore. One was a mother-calf pair, and the calf had obviously been attacked by killer whales, missing half of its flukes. The other group, a trio, were acting similar to a competitive group on the breeding grounds. Other marine mammals sighted included a few groups of harbour porpoises and half a dozen juvenile northern fur seals.

Started out with <b>L Pod</b> actively porpoising past the house towards the Center For Whale Research (west side San Juan Island). Reports come in all morning that <b>all 3 pods</b> are moving up the west side of San Juan Island going North. And luckily, the L12's, staying with tradition of not going up to Active Pass turn around and return south. We waited at the entrance to Speiden Channel, and the L12's didn't disappoint. When I got home and began cooking dinner, I looked out the kitchen window and saw that the whales were at the same place as when the day started.

<b>All 3 pods</b>..including the famous ruffles. Our host said most all of the whales of the 3 pods were accounted for. They breached, spy hopped and splashed..all my dreams came true in one amazing afternoon.

We were on the 5.15 am ferry out of Tsawwassen to Duke Point and lo and behold, just 15 min out of the terminal, in the rising sun, we saw a pod of <b>orcas</b>. Now they were really spread out, but assuming, having seen only one large male, it was Jpod.
<br/>Ellen and Monette
<br/>*<br/>
We  followed and found the <b>orcas</b> spread all over between Cypress and Blakely. They were fishing the tide, heading slowly south. Soundwatch visited us and told us everyone was there except the L12s.
Lots of breaching! We left them about <b>4:30</b> near the south end of Blakely. What a treat!!

We were with <b>L-25's</b> on the west side of San Juan Island, a little north of Salmon Bank <b>at dinner time</b>. The <b>orcas</b> were very spread out, foraging along with the gill-netters and purse seiners. As they approached a boat just setting his gill net, they grouped up tight and appeared to go under the net together...maybe making sure the younger ones knew what to do. The L-12s were very seriously hunting down the bank. L-41 made some very sharp rolls at the surface as he was zooming after his dinner. There must have been some salmon hiding under our keel as he made three passes around us.

Decisions decisions....most of the Southern Residents were up to the north and the <b>L12's</b> were hanging out near Cattle Point, so we decided to go for the short run today. As the afternoon progressed, the whales began to slowly move from Cattle Point towards Eagle Point.

On <b>morning</b> trip, <b>J, K &amp; most of L pod</b> were found just south of Alden Bank, east of Sucia Island. They were very spread out, travelling slowly southbound. We left them just east of Matia Island at about <b>1145</b> am. On the <b>afternoon</b> trip, we caught up to the same whales just at the north end of Blakely Island at about <b>4:15 pm</b>. They must have had a little afternoon rest somewhere - they certainly didn't travel their usual distance for 4.5 hrs. Just when we arrived on scene, we observed what appeared to be a meeting ceremony going on, which was a little surprising as we thought these whales had spent the entire past day together. Apparently, the ceremony was between the L's that had travelled North and those that had stayed down South. Our boat observed this from quite a great distance (perhaps someone else saw it a little closer for a better story), but it was still a very special sighting for crew &amp; passengers alike.

On the <b>afternoon</b> trip, <b>J, K &amp; part of L pod</b> was headed north in Swanson Channel, very spread out. As the whales approached Active pass, they funnelled together, as they usually do. Just before going into Active pass, the leaders of the group travelling along the shore of Mayne Island stopped. First the leader turned to face south, then the next 2 whales did the same thing. The 3 were lined up side by side along the rocky shore line, logging at the surface, just as though they were preparing for a meeting ceremony. They stayed there for a minute or two, just until the pod(s) caught up, then they turned, and the whole group started porpoising towards Active Pass all together. We were too far away for ID's on those leaders, especially with the sun also glistening off the the water, but it was a very special sighting for us &amp; for our passengers.

Our <b>black and white friends</b> started the day out near Hein Bank, slowly moving up the west side of San Juan. They did the old North/South turnaround a few times before slowly heading towards Turn Point. By the time we got up North, the whales were instead going up from Turn Point towards Swanson channel. Whales spread out over a mile apart, which meant keeping the old head on a swivel as whales came together in groups, only to break up and go their own ways. Some good vocalizations and one other boat had a great story I'm sure they'll email in on a very unusual occurance. Cappuccino (K21) gave us a really good viewing as he foraged in a nearby current. Lots of eagles and seals (one seal "breached" no less than 4 times near the shore) on the way home. Whales were still heading back to the Fraser (hopefully to eat a lot of coho).

<b>J,K &amp; L pod</b> were travelling slowly Westbound in Boundary Pass in the late afternoon, very spread out. J's and L's had headed for Turn Point already, while the K's were lagging way behind along the shoreline of South Pender Island. The tide must have started to turn while we were there, because the K's all suddenly became much more interested in foraging in the tide rips than in continuing their journey. We observed one of the moms apparently teaching her calf how to lunge at a fish (possibly Lea &amp; K36, but no definite ID).

The whales spent the night at the Fraser River, so it was good that they came down in time for our afternoon trip. As we set up south of Saturna Island, the whales came from Eastpoint, and really began to spread out.  Lots of breaches as they got midway down Boundary, and the vocalizations were incredible! Ruffles, that incredible guy managed no less than two full breaches! As we were preparing to leave, <b>J-Pod</b> gave a surprise visit right in front of the boat. Blackberry even came up on his side, giving us a look and a very languid pectoral slap.  Awesome!

On Wednesday morning I picked up the <b>T18's</b> between Albert Head and William Head. They were leaping around and vocalizing at the surface. I had some incredible vocalizing coming up through the hull of the boat. They were acting very proud. From the descriptions that I got from the day before it sounds like they were the 4 T's with T14 yesterday. It was interesting that the whole time the T18's were vocalizing, J Clan without the L 12's were 2 or 3  miles resting. We left the T18's west bound at Bechey Head at <b>1330</b>.
<br/>Cheers,

We were fishing off of Beechey Head and around <b>1:45pm</b> we were surprised by <b>a large dorsal fin</b> about 100 yards off our boat and then we saw 3 more. We managed to get ahead of them and wait for them to resurface. They went down for a long dive because it was about 5 minutes later before they surfaced off in the distance. We were with them for about 45 minutes.  We last saw the four of them on the south side of Secretary Island heading north in the strait. It was an amazing afternoon. I have a picture of a saddle patch.

<b>Transients</b> were spotted west of Race Rocks. Too far for Soundwatch, especially with M3 on the water. So at 11:45 we gave up and headed home. Then a call at <b>2:00</b>---the residents made a turn at Race and were heading back to San Juan. As we left Snug Harbor, we spied many whales heading North. We set up as usual on the outside of the boats so we could monitor boats, and had <b>J-1</b> Ruffles swimming by himself on the outside of the group. As the whales headed North past the Turn Point lighthouse, one Orca gave the perfect spyhop, as if saying "yep, we're right next to the lighthouse gang!"

Today I got to watch 5 <b>transients</b> off the Edwards Point-Hannah Heights area between <b>3 pm and 5 pm</b>. The whale watch operators identified the male transient as <b>T14</b>. They also said that there were 4 transients, but there was also a small calf travelling very close to its mother. It did not surface as often as the others, unless they were travelling. As the transients crossed the straits toward San Juan Island, I spotted a group of at least 4 Dall's porpoises about 1/2 mile offshore, heading north along the west side of the island, travelling a little south of the transients, but perpendicular to them. As I watched with some trepidation, suddenly the transients started thrashing around behind one of the whale watch zodiacs, right around where I had last seen the dall's. The activity of the transients was pretty amazing--one leaped out of the water and did an almost perfect orca "swan" dive. I had not seen an orca do this before. Although I suspected that one of the dall's had become lunch, I heard over the marine radio that a harbor seal had jumped out of the water onto the engine bracket of one of the zodiacs.  It stayed there for apparently more than 15 minutes, until the transients had moved south quite a distance. I don't know how the boat operator enticed it back into the water, but it was probably interesting!

Around <b>6 pm</b> we were crabbing in Westsound and saw 2 <b>animals</b> breeching between Victim Island and Double Island. I would guess they were about 10'-12' and came out of the water about 6' or so, hung there and came down on their stomachs. One of them did this in 2 sets of 3-4 breeches and the other breeched twice. They were grey with the underside a little lighter.
Could they have been young Minke whales or something else?  We didn't see any decernable blows and no sign of a mother whale around - It was pretty amazing to see in Westsound.

We had <b>all three pods</b> at Hannah Heights, slowly moving up San Juan Island. The whales were spread out over an area close to a mile wide and the distance between leaders and stragglers was probably close to a mile as well.

Between <b>12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m</b>, the best superpod of the year that I've caught off Landbank, south of Lime Kiln Park. Very close in. Much rolling, tail slapping, spyhopping, breaching, everything. Lots of surface vocalizations.  <b>L12</b> came very close in and spyhopped for my camera about 5 times. <b>J1</b> came by tail slapping somewhat in unison with one of the younger calves. Then many of the big males decided to roll around together off Deadman Bay. Lots of great activity. By the time they went by County Park, many were resting.

<b>Orcas!</b> Yeah! After 4 days out in the Straits and beyond, <b>all 3 pods</b> of whales arrived back safe and sound off the West side of San Juan Island. They headed towards False Bay as they crossed the straits, and turned south towards Cattle Point. As we were leaving the dock, we heard they were heading north and sure enough we found them just North of Lime Kiln.

At about <b>5:10 pm</b> I just happened to look out through our telescope, wondering if the <b>Transient</b> pod might be in our neighborhood, &amp; the first thing I saw when I looked through the scope was an orca surfacing! ...they fed in the area between Lowell Pt, Camano Island, &amp; East Point &amp; Baby Island at the entrance to Holmes Harbor. They were first right off Lowell Pt, then headed into Holmes Harbor at a fast porpoise, then stopped to do more hunting. We reluctantly left them, but they were still feeding in the area near the entrance to Holmes Harbor. It looks like 6 orcas, with one or two young ones.
