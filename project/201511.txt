<b>CA172, CA173 and CA166 in the Juan de Fuca</b>. -Mark Malleson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 p.m. - A probable humpback blow about a mile east of Point No Point</b>. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>2:45 p.m. - </b>The<b> whale was pretty much straight out from the Puget Marina, probably pretty close to shore and we watched it drift south toward Tolmie Park</b>. We saw blows and the birds were massed on the water and rose into the air with each set of blows. Seeing whale spouts from Andy's Marine Park Beach on Anderson Island looking across to the Nisqually Reach preserve. No direction, feeding and breaching, but very distant for observation from here. Likely humpback/gray, not orca. -Belen Schneider

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

My husband and I saw<b> 2 Orcas</b> spy hopping and breaching off the<b> California coast halfway between Pescadero and Santa Cruz</b>. They were clearly feeding as they stayed in the same spot for a long while but would disappear under water then resurface minutes later.  At least other whales were spouting farther out and to the side, but I couldn't identify them as Orcas. By the way, we also noticed a few seals had come in close to shore and were just hanging out. -Nancy Walker

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 28</font></b></center>
<br/>

The<b> K12s between Sooke and Cliffs in the middle of the Juan de Fuca Strai</b>t.  Very spread out and foraging... They were slowly moving westward.
Looking towards the Olympic Peninsula and the Elwha Valley... -Debbie Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K pod in the Juan de Fuca Strait</b>, near the Elwha. -Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Boarded the Peregrine at 1PM  and we were initially heading to see some humpbacks off of Victoria. It was a good thing we topped off the gas tanks before heading out because after arriving to Victoria we got word of <b>orcas out past Race Rocks</b>. And yes, <b>residents</b>! Wow. Our final destination put us smack dab in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca west of Port Angeles between Sooke and Cliffs. We arrived on scene after <b>3:00 PM</b> and encountered some <b>members of the K12's</b> very spread out and foraging. We saw <b>K33 </b>actively fishing. They were slowly <b>moving westward</b>. Looking towards the Olympic Peninsula and the Elwha Valley, you can't help but reflect on the positive effects the Elwha restoration will have on salmon recovery and our resolve must not be broken until the Snake River Dams are breached as well. -Debbie Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>K POD</b> TODAY!! When we got a report early this morning of killer whales heading west, no one expected to see the Resident Orcas today. I however, held out hope. Historically, they always seem to make an appearance right around, or on Thanksgiving. Today, we happened to get lucky when Dale Mitchell (out of Victoria) found these guys milling <b>close to the mouth of the Elwha River. Members of K Pod were spread out foraging</b>, as you might expect for this time of year. Their food source (Chinook/King salmon) is getting scarce now with our dramatically reduced salmonid population here in the Pacific Northwest, so they will need to be serious about foraging if they're to survive the winter. These whales will average 80 miles per day of travel this time of year, and will need to replenish the calories they burn traveling daily. What a treat to see these guys today ... they may not have been jumping out of the water in full breaches, but each moment with them was precious. I'm so grateful that I got to spend some time with them! -Heather MacIntyre

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 a.m. - Probable K pod</b> sighting about <b>10 am</b> in Strait of Juan de Fuca south of Victoria, heading west. -Reported by Ken Balcomb.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:20 a.m. - </b>Watching it <b>[humpback] from the Kingston bluff</b>...it doesn't look too big from here. It was tail slapping a lot. -Brian Stoll

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:06 a.m. -</b> whale <b>blows north of Kingston around Rose Point</b> - seems to be moving northerly toward <b>Elgo</b>n. Close to Kitsap side. Type - I'd guess humpback. -Stu Davdison


<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:00 a.m. - </b>Rare treat this morning on the Ferry ride to <b>Kingston</b>. Whale spotted lobtailing (tail slapping) off the port side bow of the ferry. Just east of Kingston. -Josh Hansen

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>4:26 p.m. - </b> on the bluff just <b>north of the Kingston ferry</b>, saw many go by including a<b> couple of large males</b>. Closser to this side although out in the shipping lanes. -Michelle Goll

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 p.m. - </b> at least some stalled <b>south of Kingston ferry</b>. They've spread out and are making many directional changes and some diving as if foraging. They often do there. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:45 p.m. -</b>  if it's the same group they are just south of <b>Kingston near President Point</b>. We're watching from Richmond beach. <b>Heading north</b>. -Jon Garrett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:44 p.m. - </b>heading north again, off <b>President Point</b>, close in to Kitsap, (I could hear them), toward Kingston. -Joanne Graves

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:33 p.m. - </b>Been watching them for about an hour. Still heading up north towards <b>Kingston</b>. -Lindsay Ekblad

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:32 p.m. -</b> on ferry from <b>Edmonds to Kingston </b>and they still south from here. This should be a great spot to watch them in a little while. Closer to Kitsap side, heading north. -Michelle Goll

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 p.m.  - from Kayu Kayu Ac </b>park, north Richmond Beach in <b>Shoreline</b>, can see the lead group north and west of yellow mid channel bouy between us and President Point, Kitsap. Heading towards Kingston. Trailers half a mile behind. -Ed Brooks

<b>12:15 p.m. to 12:40 p.m. - Probable humpback blows off Point No Point</b> seen from south of Bush Point. Can't tell if it's more than one humpback, but we're just happy to see humpbacks in the Possession Triangle (roughly from Edmonds to Kingston to Scatchet Head on Whidbey Island). That makes almost three months of possibly continual visitation in that area by up to three or four humpbacks some days. Not to mention regular humpback sightings in the south Sound, and all around the Salish Sea. There's much to say thanks for on this Thanksgiving Day. Wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving. -Susan and Howard, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:37 a.m. -</b> About an hour ago I drove across the <b>Hood Canal Bridge and saw blows</b> only about 100 yards north of the bridge, mid span. Definitely not humpback, but I couldn't stop to look closer. Couldn't see the back or tail. Lots of birds at the surface too. -Amy K Fowler

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 25</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>6:09  p.m. - Puget Sound  -</b>  this was posted on another group I belong to, "Im at Al's and can see them near <b>Point Richmond </b>out in the middle" (to confirm orca came up Colvos). -Brittany Gordon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 p.m. -</b> they were fighting the current and moving pretty slow. A group six or so! We think they headed up the channel between <b>Gig Harbor and Vashon island.</b> (Colvos Passage)
<br/><b>3:25 p.m. - </b>They are at <b>Point Defiance</b> now, heading north. -Desiree Brake

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:50 p.m. - </b>They are near the <b>Tacoma Narrows Bridge</b> right now, just saw them. It looked like they were heading south toward Chambers Bay. -Brian Mickelson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:40-1:50 p.m. -</b>  Just saw <b>3-4 orcas in Gig Harbor very near the Narrows Bridge</b>. Appeared to be feeding, perhaps including juveniles. Got some pictures but they're very small in them. -Noelle Bailliett

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:30 a.m. -</b>  Report of <b>orcas heading North around the east side of Anderson island</b>, past Cole Point. Talked to the gentleman who lived on Cole Point and had seen them around 11:30. He said they were very active and it sounded like they were breaching and playing. -Belen Schneider

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:46 p.m. - </b>looks to be a <b>humpback</b> (blows) just south east off of south east beach of <b>Point No Point</b> as seen from north Edmonds. Direction unknown. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>8:10 a.m. to 11:55 a.m. - at least 3 humpbacks off Point No Point </b>in mid-channel, seen from south of Bush Point, Whidbey Island. Happy Thanksgiving. -Howard and Susan, Orca Network

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 24</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>4:45 p.m. - Spotted four orcas swimming lazily in Pickering Passage northbound</b> on the west side of northern Harstine Island, south Puget Sound, one orca was very likely a male. He was trailing the other three orcas by 200-300m and was swimming in more of a circular pattern (feeding?). -Paul Dinnel

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:15 p.m. - Orcas: Five possibly just came through Pickering Passage</b> headed slowly towards Allyn. -Mary  R Larson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:30 p.m. - </b>photo of <b>pod traveling north</b> up the east side of <b>Case Inlet</b>.
<b>2:46 p.m. - Three whales spotted headed North in Case Inlet</b>. Heading toward north tip of Harstine Island, south Puget Sound. -Jerilyn Evans

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:33 a.m.  - Puget Sound -  </b>Seeing multiple blows - at least ten within a minute,<b> just NW of Point No Point. Guessing humpback</b>. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:55 a.m. - </b>Watching frequent blows that look to be north west of <b>Point No Point,</b> as seen from north Edmonds.  Blows seem to be a northerly direction - guessing humpback or grey. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 23</font></b></center>
<br/>

I love heading out out with a full boat, and then finding Orcas! In this case, it was <b>a single Orca, T77A</b>. Such good news, since the last time he was seen, he was tangled in some line and a float. NOT TODAY! SWIMMING FREE! Notice the identifying notches in the dorsal fin! <b>Near D'Arcy Island, BC</b>. -Capt. Jim Maya, Maya Legacy Charters

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:25 p.m. - Penn Cove  - </b>Jenny, at the Mosquito Fleet restaurant in <b>Coupeville</b>, along with several customers, saw a whale surface a few hundred yards from shore, between the beach and the dock at the end of the Coupeville Wharf. From the description it <b>sounds like a gray whale</b>. It was heading east, out of Penn Cove.

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 22</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>3:00 p.m. - the Ks and L</b>s seen yesterday in Puget Sound <b>have headed out to the wide Pacific, seen near Sombrio</b>, almost to Port Renfrew. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Johnny Berg, Wendy Pinnow and I caught up with <b>K and L pod (minus the L12s) way out west past Jordan River</b>. It was so great to see the orcas again, especially the exotic L54s, and to see Johnny's face as he saw orcas for the first time in his life. -Melisa Pinnow

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>L54 and L90</b> westbound out the<b> Juan de Fuca Strait</b>. We came across members of <b>K's and L's off of Jordan River </b>in the afternoon.  They were moving quickly west bound. -Mark Malleson 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:25 p.m. - south Puget Sound -</b> Distant photos, but for the sake of tracking and documentation, I think this is <b>a Transient male south of the Chamber's Bay Golf Course and north of Steilacoom</b>. -Belen Schneider

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:41 p.m. -</b> it's hard to tell at this point but they're headed towards the <b>south end of McNeil Island</b>.
<br/><b>3:33 p.m. -</b> Make that <b>at least 4 </b>next to a jet ski. 3:25 p.m. - <b>At least 2 orcas headed south in Hale Passage </b>heading towards Steilacoom. At least one boat next to them. Towards the<b> southwest end of Fox Island</b>. -Kelly Lauricella

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:11 p.m. </b>- heading SE towards the <b>Narrows Bridge</b>. They are beside us right now.

We received a report from Loren of <b>a pod of ~10 orcas off Redondo Beach</b> about 100 yards off the beach at about 3 pm. He said at first they were spread out, then they all collected in a really tight pod of 7 or 8 fins, and stayed that way for 20 - 25 minutes, then headed south toward Tacoma. (We found this report late in the day. Coupled with the WSF report below of southbound orcas off south end of Bainbridge, it indicates the pods split at some point - ALB)

The best part about today's visit from <b>Jpod</b> was not that they came close, or breached a bunch, but they were foraging. I could see them chasing fish and really moving around to get food.

We spotted some <b>orcas from 10:00-10:30am</b> this morning on the <b>west side of Lummi Island</b> (out in the pass between Lummi and Clark, but closer to us on Lummi). They were a ways out and it is very windy so there were a lot of white caps. ...they were far out, at least 2 smaller ones that seemed to be calves, and several adults (at the very least 2, but I'd guess <b>more like 4 or 5. At least one adult male</b>. They appeared to be playing and maybe feeding. They were jumping a lot and sort of circling around a relatively small area right on the line (either the tide line or where the currents were meeting). They also appeared once or twice to either be dragging/tossing something through the surface of the water, or sort of jolting quickly along the surface (again, hard to discern what we were seeing there given the distance and the waves). from what I could tell they were moving south/southwest, since they seemed to drift a little that way over the course of the 20-30 minutes I was watching.  The last one we saw was significantly to the left (aka south), although after that I didn't see any of them again in either direction. -Kelsey McLane

Tacoma - The <b>whale</b> was seen at <b>11:15</b> only about 200ft from shore, if that. It was in the same area as the eider. No large dorsal fin seen and it only surfaced twice. No blowing seen. It appeared grayish with white spots (though these could be due to barnacles) and appeared maybe 30 to 40 feet in length. Any whale in Tacoma is a pretty good find.

Transient Killer whales feed on marine mammals and don't often get the opportunity to "let loose". The noise they make from having a bit of fun can make their presence know to their prey. So when they do have a bit of fun, they give it their best and have lot of fun all at once. We just happened to be there at the time when things got quite amazing. 4 different family groups were together and were socializing like crazy! We were able to put the hydrophone down too and heard incredible vocals as well! Truly an amazing encounter on a beautiful November day! The 4 family groups were the <b>T049A's T123's T68B's T68C</b>. -Traci Walter

Reports this morning of two separate groups of whales, not together but just a few miles apart had me presuming the larger group was the <b>Southern Residents,</b> and very curious about the second group. Kimberly first spotted them <b>off Manchester</b>, and then subsequent reports from Brittany, Sue Larkin and others had me chasing these whales. They headed north, as the residents flipped north too, and the T's took off. They made record speed around<b> Restoration Point</b> on Bainbridge Island and past the Bainbridge ferry lanes to Rolling Bay, while the Residents were near the north end of Vashon Island. I headed to Rolling Bay Bluff. Not long after I started searching, they popped up in front of me, and appeared to rest from their exertion for a few minutes.Susan showed up and not only did she see them, but her Mom got to see them too. These <b>Transients </b>resumed their travels at a slower but steady speed in typical sneaky T behavior by disappearing for a good amount of time before popping back up further north, traveling on the west side of <b>Puget Sound</b> mid-channel. Identified by Sara as <b>T37As, T37 and T34s</b>. Thanks everyone - much fun running into you all today!
<br/><b>1:46 p.m. - Northern group of Transients</b> continued north after a few minutes of resting. They are on the west side of mid channel.

<b>Noon </b>- Hello, While riding my bicycle across the <b>Tacoma Narrows Bridge</b>, I happen to see this <b>Gray whale surfing near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge</b>, agitating the water. It surfaced at least three times and submerged, but shallow enough that I could still see where it was and where it was going. I was able to get these pictures, before it fluked, and disappeared as a boat was coming at speed, not at it, just close by. If it came back up, it would have been under the bridge and out of my sight. -Ralph Reed

A pod of harbor porpoise as well as a Steller sea lion popped up off shore while watching the orcas swim by. Just minutes later, the orca plane flew overhead, though it was probably too choppy for them to spot whales. There was also a steady line of sailboats headed out on this cold, windy day.

Days recap by Rachel Haight who first spotted and reported the orcas: My whale scouting routine always starts at <b>Ebey's Landing</b>. When I first arrived, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something black, then disappear. I figured it was a bird, since it is 99% of the time. As I was about to drive up the bluff for a better look, I looked out my window and saw multiple fins! What I initially took to be a small pod of transients turned out to actually be a lot of residents! I followed them as they traveled south past Whidbey and past Edmonds with Alisa as well. We even saw <b>a humpback in the same vicinity as the orcas</b>. The closest pictures were taken from<b> Bush Pt,</b> while the picture of the<b> line of blows was taken at Edmonds</b>. The line of their backlit blows as they swam along were breathtaking.

A message from Paul Cotrell, DFO Marine Mammal Coordinator: We received a report/pictures yesterday through the BC Marine Mammal Response Network that <b>T077A may have a rope and float entanglement</b> (see photo). The animal was sighted with the gear from the <b>Thetis Island-Chemainus Ferry </b>in Stuart Channel (20 miles south of Nanaimo). If you can add this information to your Orca Network with the details that if the animal is sighted to please call the BCMMRN 1-800-465-4336 (in Canada), or 1-877-SOS-WHALe (1-877-767-9425) (in US) and if gear still attached to monitor from a distance and not engage with the animal or gear. We have our expert disentanglement team ready to go. Hopefully the gear has come off on its own. Paul Cottrell, Pacific Marine Mammal Coordinator

Travelling several pods over long period of time Some out by mid channel buoy some closer to President Pt Rd Looked like females with babies coming last but there were many over a 1 hour or so. Great to see them in the sound. -Margret Steen

<br/><b>8:00 a.m. - several orcas spread out approx 3 miles south of Possession Point </b>and 3 miles west of Edmonds. Foraging? Milling? In southerly direction. And a humpback! Viewing from high bluff Stamm Overlook park. Rain squall impairing visibility towards Whidbey a bit to see if others continued, but appears they have flipped, any whales I'm seeing are southbound.
<br/><b>7:38 a.m. - from Edmonds I see blows </b>and dorsals spread out from Eglon to maybe a mile plus south if Scatchet Head buoy. <b>Northbound</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:44 p.m. - Lone humpback deep in South Puget Sound</b>. Heading south into Eld Inlet and passing Flap Jack Point. And it trumpeted during two of the surfacing series. Very cool! This is absolutely NOT the same whale or type of whale from yesterday's "mystery" which I think Orca Network has 'solved'. This is far too small and behaved totally differently. -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:03 p.m. -  humpback right in front of Eglon</b>, can be seen with bare eyes. Headed south right in front of a green flashing light out from the south tip of whidbey island. -Brittany Gordon

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

One of<b> two humpbacks </b>who surprised me while watching for orcas. They surfaced next to us on the docked ferry and cruised within 100 yards of shore. Here they are further south of the fishing pier with <b>Edmonds Marina</b> beach in background. -Janine Harles

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

The M/V Sea Lion had an incredible day out on the water with the <b>Southern Residents including K12 Sequim and K16 and K20 Spock</b>today, as they traveled south through <b>Rosario</b>. We found them in the pouring rain and 5 foot seas near <b>Lawson Reef</b> with the help of reports from the ferry and shore... Thanks to those who helped us find them today! They were in a very splashy mood: breaching, tail lobbing, and spyhopping. It seemed they were having a grand old time in the waves! -Sarah McCullagh

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Southern Residents - There were whales everywhere. Several <b>groups of 3-7 whales. I saw at least 3+ babies and multiple adult males.</b> Seemed like they <b>paraded by Fort Ebey</b> for a good 20 minutes or more. Some groups closer to shore, some a little further out, but I'm so glad they came closer to the Whidbey side. So nice hearing them breathe, and having the problem of not knowing which orca pod to film because there were so many! When I saw the report of orcas southbound along Smith Island, I had to head out. It wasn't long before I realized there were dozens of whales and that they were residents!!! I had wanted, so desperately, to be there the moment the SRKWs came back for their first fall visit, and boy did my wish come true. I never expected them to hug Whidbey as they headed south, so it was quite the treat! I spent well over an hour with them at two different spots on Whidbey. Guess that fortune cookie was right after all!  It's not the best video quality, and my camera wasn't always cooperating, but here's a sample of what I saw today! -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:36 - 6:26  p.m. - listened to Southern Residents (sounded like Js, Ks and some Ls) on Port Townsend hydrophone!!!</b> Happy day! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:50 p.m. -  J pod too.</b>
<br/><b>5:40 p.m. -</b> I heard plenty of<b> L pod calls</b> so unless Onyx was doing his talkative thing we have L pod in the mix. Wasn't sure about K pod though due to distance from hp. -Meg McDonald

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
Hearing calls on <b>PT hydrophone 5:35 pm</b>! Listen in to the <b>Southern Residents off Port Townsend, WA</b>- YAY!! so happy they are finally heading into Puget Sound (a month later than usual)! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I couldn't count fast enough but had to be at least <b>12 strung out swimming past Ft Ebey about 4:40 this evening</b>. Amazing sight! -Sharon Sherman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:05 p.m. -</b> I left<b> Fort Ebey </b>the trailing group was well south of me and disappearing into the low light.
<br/><b>4:47 p.m. -</b> Should be on PT hydro soon. Hugging <b>Whidbey side south bound past Ebey</b>. I think it's J pod.
<br/><b>4:17 p.m. - </b>Big breach of an orca, they're off<b> Partridge Point (Whidbey) now</b>, southbound. Lots of them!!! Could it be residents?! -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:16 p.m. -</b> I just came in from watching, counted over 12, they traveled in a few smaller groups, traveled pretty fast, south, passed along the eastern side of the buoy, I think its the green one out there. They only just became so distant I couldn't track them anymore
<br/><b>3:29 p.m. - 4-6 orca along the north east side of Smith Island</b>. Slowly moving south along the island. Viewing with binoculars from our house along west beach. -Melinda Killian

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:07 p.m. - </b>Just spotted these whales. They are by the <b>south end of Lopez Island</b> now, presumably heading west. I can barely see blows and splashes (probably breaches) with my binos. -Rachel Haight

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon - </b>Maia at WA State Ferries relayed a report of a pod of <b>8 orcas in Rosario St</b>., on the Anacortes side. No direction of travel given.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Awesome! We saw<b> one big male</b> as we were getting off the ferry at <b>Kingston this morning about 10am</b>. It was heading north. Can't be 100%, it was real quick but it was a distinct black fin...fairly large dorsal Wished I would of had more time to investigate! -Josh Murphy

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:14 p.m. - central Puget Sound - </b>He is still able to be seen at the pier (Harper Pier, Port Orchard) he did a deeper dive but he's here, gonna see if I can find a closer spot and it's definitely a <b>humpback</b>! -Ashley Arciniega-Luu

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>4:00 p.m. - north central Puget Sound - </b> Easy to locate as the <b>humpback</b> is being followed by a huge flock of gulls. The Whale is definitely feeding off a fish ball.
3:31 p.m. - huge splashes (breaching) just east of Point No Point. Likely a humpback. Easily seen naked eye from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:50 p.m. - Saratoga Passage  - </b>Multiple blows and back sightings off west side of <b>Camano Island, near Madrona Beach</b>. Guessing <b>humpbacks</b>... Don't look like orcas. Appear to be feeding and slowing moving north. -Lise Place

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:43 p.m. - central Puget Sound </b> - Just saw him from <b>Harper Pier</b>, Port Orchard. Did not get photo, but saw <b>humpback</b> fluke.
<br/><b>2:27 p.m. - </b>Whale sighting now south of <b>Blake island</b>, can see spout from Harper pier. -Rachel Pamela

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:00 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound - </b> several whales (separate blows) <b>near Eglon area, between Kingston and Point No Point</b>. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:36 p.m. - central Puget Sound - </b>Still a whale <b>near Blake Island</b> (just to the NW of it) today. Spotted from the ferry, crew says it was also here an hour ago. Couldn't tell type, multiple blows, one spyhop, but seen only briefly and from a distance. I'm thinking humpback. Nose had more that shape, from what I briefly saw. -Karl Johnson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:15 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound  - </b>whale blows near <b>Rose Point (north of Kingston)</b>. Type and direction again unknown yet (weather is limiting good views).
<br/><b>9:20 a.m. - whale blow</b> just<b> north of Kingston ferry terminal</b> (maybe 1/4 mile). Type or direction hasn't been determined yet. (An probable orca sighting was reported in same general location. Each report could be orca or humpback, both species have been in the area - ALB) -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>9:30 a.m. LARGE mystery whale in Eld Inlet.</b> First spotted a very tall (15+ feet) "blow" heading south. Went to the deck. Heard a VERY LOUD blow to my south. Then one to the north. Then it apparently circled around and surfaced less than 20 feet off my bank. Could only get one quick photo of its back. It has a very distinct dorsal fin - making me question if its a different whale than a humpback. It circled around again and did a shallow surface about 40 feet from shore. I wasn't prepared for it to do that. No other photo I.D. Very choppy water and high wind makes its blows dissipate very quickly. Never showed a fluke. Last seen heading north toward Squaxin Island. -Kim Merriman
