<b>Evening, two grays</b> in the north end of <b>Port Susan</b>, later joined by another pair swimming very close together.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Pt., WA 
<br/>*<br/>
Jerry Pitsch of Oak Harbor called to report one <b>Gray whale</b> off <b>West Beach</b>, NW Whidbey Island, heading north. He watched it from<b> 4:10 -4:40 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Matt Klope of Oak Harbor reported a <b>Gray Whale</b> off <b>West Beach</b>, Whidbey Island early afternoon. The whale was observed from the air, and feeding behavior as well as feeding pits on the beach were observed. 
<br/>*<br/>
Jerry Betts called to report a <b>Gray whale</b> off Baby Island at <b>11:24 am</b>, in 20-30' of water, spouting &amp; rolling, likely feeding. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 29, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
We were out on the R/V Pt Lobos, operated by MBARI and saw a pod of <b>orcas </b>surfacing near our ship around <b>9:00am</b>, we were at approximately 36 47.7904N 121 53.8873. There were 8 or 9 individuals. They all seemed to be full grown, there were 3 pairs swimming and breaching next to each other and also a few singles. They were swimming towards shore (which also is following the canyon wall).
<br/>Katie Roberts, Department of Ocean Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz 
<br/>*<br/>
Jerry Pitsch of Oak Harbor observed a <b>Gray whale</b> off West Beach at <b>5:45 pm</b>, moving north and south, then just logging on the surface for awhile. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:00am</b> - One <b>gray </b>feeding close to shore at <b>Kayak Point</b> working its way north.
<br/>Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Pt. 
<br/>*<br/>
Four <b>Gray Whales</b> in <b>Boundary Bay</b> this <b>afternoon</b>, and distant blows from two more were spotted in the Southern Strait of Georgia by Captain Rich Massey. One of the whales in Boundary Bay is very recognizable, with a large white splotch just below the dorsal lump on its left side. Although some foraging was observed, the whales were mostly milling. 
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch 
<br/>*<br/>
On <b>Camano Island</b> directly across form Langley on Whidbey Island, on a sandy spit that is very deep. At about <b>2:30</b> I noticed the spray from a whale in the middle of Saratoga Passage going north. I watched the whale for about an hour and noticed that he started heading south towards us. We walked to the shore and sure enough one big <b>Gray Whale</b> was off the point and I think looking for food. He surfaced one or twice and then his tall went up and he dove. He was down more than five minutes and surfaced right off the beach. We were so involved in watching Gray Whale #1 that just down the shore there was Gray Whale number #2 was even closer to the shore and in much shallow water, that one was heading north. We watched Gray Whale #1 for a while and then he headed south toward Hat Island.
<br/>Carol Stutzman, Bothell, WA
<br/>*<br/>
I was at <b>Saratoga Beach</b> boat launch this evening, <b>8pm </b>and saw 3 or 4 <b>gray whales</b> just off of <b>Baby island</b> (1 large and 2 or 3 smaller ones). The whales were just off of the green bouy NW of baby island right at sunset diving and appearing every few minutes but were too far out for photos etc.
<br/>Garet Keller, Freeland

<br/><br/>
Today reports first came in around <b>11.30am</b> of <b>Transient Orcas</b> near Sheringham Lighthouse. We headed out on a <b>2pm </b>trip and caught up with the <b>5 Transient Orcas</b> just North of <b>Race Rocks</b>. The Orcas were later identified as the T49's by Ron Bates, MMRG. Whilst we observed the T49's we did see signs of a kill underwater and the Orcas milling around after the kill.
<br/>Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient killer whales T20 and T21</b> and 7 other small fins (T23's?) came through <b>Seymour Narrow's</b> on a big ebb tide yesterday (4/28) and swam past <b>Campbell River</b> at about <b>5pm </b>southbound. A "huge" Humpback whale spent some time at Chatham Pt. making some very long deep dives.
<br/>Matthew Ellis, Eagle Eye Adventures, Campbell River BC 
<br/>*<br/>
Gary Chittam of KING 5 TV called to let us know they had located our floating <b>dead Gray whale</b> off Camano Head at around <b>12:30 pm</b>, and there were 4 live Grays in the area around south Camano Island and Gedney/Hat Island as well. Video of the newscast about the necropsy on the Birch Bay Gray whale also includes aerial footage of the Saratoga dead whale and the live whales they observed this morning. 
<br/>*<br/>
Glenda Maronde of Oak Harbor called to report <b>2 Gray whales</b> off <b>Rocky Pt</b>, NW Whidbey Island at <b>10:50 am</b>, 50-100' offshore, heading south, then north. She also observed the whales there on the 25th &amp; 26th. 
<br/>*<br/>
Veronica von Allworden called to report <b>1 Gray whale</b> in Saratoga Passage opposite <b>Langley</b>, closer to the Camano side, headed SE toward Camano Head at <b>10:30 am</b>.  
<br/><br/>
<b>April 27, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
A "huge" <b>Humpback </b>whale spent some time at <b>Chatham Pt</b>. in Seymour Narrow's. Lot's of krill showing on the surface in amongst the tide lines. Several reports of <b>humpbacks </b>and <b>gray whales</b> passing through <b>Discovery Passage</b> through spring.
<br/>Matthew Ellis, Eagle Eye Adventures, Campbell River BC 
<br/>*<br/>
We had a <b>Gray Whale</b> at <b>Crescent Beach</b>, Washington State, on the <b>2pm </b>Zodiac trip out of Victoria. It was actively feeding and up for one or two breaths before diving again in the shallows.
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic POW 
<br/>*<br/>
Between <b>3:30 and 4:30 pm</b> I observed <b>two grays</b> meandering South and then back North again, off the shores of the <b>Rocky Point/Joseph Whidbey</b> state park area.
<br/>Catherine Beard, Oak Harbor 
<br/>*<br/>
Veronica von Allworden called to report one <b>Gray whale</b> feeding heavily off NW <b>Langley </b>at <b>5:20 pm</b>, by about 6 pm it had headed SE toward downtown Langley.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 26, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
It was a great encounter with the <b>T49's</b> (<b>5 Transient orcas</b>)on our Ocean Magic trip at <b>12.15pm</b>. These animals were confirmed by Mark Malleson. We came across them off Secretary Island, <b>Sooke, Vancouver Island</b>. They were frolicking close to shore. They were encountered again on a later trip east and south of Race Rocks. They were very active with tail slaps and spyhops. Beautiful conditions on the water. 
<br/>Marie, Orca-Magic, POW 
<br/>*<br/>
So we headed out at 1:00. Then about 45 minutes later came the call and we headed out toward <b>Victoria</b>. We encountered a group of <b>Transient Orcas</b>.
<br/>Capt. Jim and Mrs. Capt. Jim Maya, 
<br/><i>Jim Maya's pics are the <b>T49A's and B's</b> again. The spyhopper is T49A with her slightly funky jawline. 
<br/>Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Reserch, San Juan Island</i>
<br/>*<br/>
One <b>Grey Whale</b>, traveling south at <b>9:30AM</b>, in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, 1/2 mile west and 1 mile south of Rocky Point, North West corner of Camano Island.
<br/>Michelle Branch
<br/><br/>
<b>April 25, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Nancy Beckvar called to report observing a <b>Gray whale</b> feeding off <b>Ebey's Landing</b>, west Whidbey Island Saturday around <b>11 am or noon</b>. She said it was between the shore and the kelp beds, and was rolling a lot with its pectoral fin up out of the water. 
<br/>*<br/>
At at <b>Saratoga Beach</b> boat launch at <b>7pm </b>I was fishing with my daughter and her friend off of baby island trolling very slowly and a lone large <b>gray whale</b> appeared just in front of our boat in shallow water. The crest was white and pretty scarred up. The whale was moving very slow from shore towards the middle of Saratoga passage not diving very far.
<br/>Garet Keller, Freeland
<br/>*<br/>
Two <b>grey whales</b> heading east up the Strait of San Juan De Fuca towards <b>Sekiu</b> at <b>10:30 am</b>. The whales where first observed at 48*-18'- 24.10" 124*-25'22.50". The primary whale had mostly a white back moving quickly eastward followed closely by a smaller nearly all grey whale.
<br/>Brian Harrmon, Chito Beach Resort, Sekiu, WA 
<br/>*<br/>
I note someone saw a Minke whale off <b>Pt Partridge</b> - this bears out my sighting of what I thought was a <b>Minke Whale</b> south of Pt Partridge around <b>4.30 pm</b>.
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from a woman reporting a sighting of <b>5-6 orcas</b> off <b>Pt. Defiance </b> shortly after sunset. They were where the tidal rips are just north of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, breaching and spyhopping. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10:40 am</b> - One <b>Minke </b>whale roaming just south of Pt. Partridge, NW Whidbey Island.
<br/>Al Luneman, Coupeville 
<br/>*<br/>
We spotted Patch, feeding on the bar south east of Hat Island around <b>1:30 pm</b>, amidst the many sailboats who were racing. On our return to Coupeville, <b>2:50 pm</b>, we found the newbie feeding by Baby Island. He doesn't like to show too much of himself - but one of his pecs showed a definite chunk missing, and rake marks on the left side. 
<br/>Jill Hein and Sandy Dubpernell, Coupeville
<br/><i>From looking at Jill's photos, this seems to be the whale that has been observed feeding in Holmes Harbor &amp; surrounding areas - Unfortunately, this may be the whale that was reported floating dead off NW Camano later in the morning, and confirmed dead by this afternoon (see below). S&amp;H</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>April 24, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Bill Ingerson called in a report of watching 2 groups of 3 <b>Gray whales</b> each off Hat/Gedney Island <b>2:30 - 3 pm</b> on Friday. He was concerned because one was on its side in 3-5' deep water, he thought it was trying to upright itself, and wondered if it might have been the whale that was found dead in Saratoga Passage on Sunday. However it is more likely that this whale was just on its side feeding on ghost shrimp in the shallow waters off the island.
<br/>*<br/>
I wanted to report two whales traveling north just <b>west of the Whidbey Island navy base</b> at <b>11:30 AM</b>. We were out running and saw the spouts of water. It took almost 6 seconds for the full body to roll through the water and then there was a slight pinkish hump at the end of the body.
<br/>Susan Cooley
<br/>*<br/>
We have had great sightings of the <b>CA transients</b> in the area for a couple of weeks. I got this photo (not pictured) of a female with a distinctive notch in her dorsal. I have photos of her from last fall with a calf. There were at least 3 calves in this group as well, so I'm sure one of them was hers, although it's probably grown quite a bit since November. 
<br/>Steve Johnston, Monterey Bay Aquarium 
<br/>*<br/>
Carmen Landrey called to report 1 <b>Gray whale</b> feeding 30-40' off <b>Saratoga Beach</b>, SE Whidbey Island at <b>noon</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
My husband says he saw <b>3-4 grays</b> in the ferry lane during the <b>8.30</b> <b>Clinton to Mukilteo ferry</b> run this morning. Ferry PA system said there was a 'handful' but they were bobbing up and down so much it was hard to count.
<br/>Chris Williams
<br/><br/>
<b>April 23, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
Capt. Jim Maya called to report a group of <b>4-6 orcas</b> 1 mile due east of <b>Mandarte Island</b> heading north in Haro Strait at <b>1:30 pm</b>. He called back to report they left them (ID'd as Transient orcas, <b>T10's</b>) at <b>5:30 pm</b> in north Swanson Channel, still heading north.
<br/>*<br/>
The Beam Reach crew sent out alerts as they followed some <b>orcas </b>- 1st NE of <b>Sidney Island</b>, BC at <b>1:30 pm</b>, then at <b>2:15</b> off Gooch Island, as the orcas headed north. 
<br/>*<br/>
Elizabeth Heinrich called to report <b>3 Gray whales</b> feeding off the NW tip of <b>Hat/Gedney</b> Island at <b>12:35 pm</b>. There was one larger whale and two smaller whales. After much surface activity, they dove. It appeared they were heading toward N. Everett or Camano Island.
<br/><br/>
<b>April 22, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
There is a large <b>Gray Whale</b> slowly moving its way north on the west side of Whidbey Island past the Navy Base towards Deception Pass SP. Its about 300 meters offshore. Most of its back is covered with the yellow crud and creatures. 
<br/>Matt Klope, Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 21, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
A photo was forwarded by Beth Phillips, of the <b>male Transient orca</b> reported in <b>Halfmoon Bay, CA</b> with several female transients, reported and photographed by Capt. Tom Mattusch. 
<br/>*<br/>
I saw my first gray whales in the <b>Strawberry Point</b> (Oak Harbor) area as per recent orca network reports of sightings. at <b>5pm</b>, I saw only a large spray of mist right onshore at the mouth of mariner's cove, then another. it took several minutes to drive and walk over to get a better view. I, indeed saw a <b>gray</b>, then another, both about 100 yards heading offshore towards camano island. I was too late to see them up close, but it was nonetheless a big thrill to watch them periodically blow for 20 minutes as they steadily headed away due east.
<br/>"limo" john, anacortes.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 Gray Whales</b> in <b>Boundary Bay</b> again this <b>afternoon</b>. For some time, 3 Grays were swimming side by side. There was also a lone Gray Whale in the Strait of Georgia, north of the coal docks, near the T14 marker. This loner did a lazy spyhop to take a look at our passengers. It's such a gift to have these gentle giants in our area, however briefly. 
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch 
<br/>*<br/>
I saw spouts mid channel heading out of holmes harbor towards <b>greenbank</b>. I was unable to confirm species but the spouts looked similar to the <b>grays </b>I've been seeing.
<br/>Garet Keller, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
1 large male <b>orca </b>and 4 females sighted 37 11.33N, 122 54.90 (off <b>Santa Clara, CA</b>) by Huli Cat Captain Tom Mattusch approximately <b>11AM</b>.
<br/>Tom Mattusch, El Granada, CA 
<br/>*<br/>
Carolyn Mercer of Greenbank called us to relay a sighting of <b>4-5 orcas</b> in Holmes Harbor around noon, by her kids who were out kayaking. They saw the big fins and some active behavior, &amp; have seen orcas before and confirmed these were orcas, not porpoise. They first saw them near Baby Island, then down by Dines Pt, still heading south into Holmes Harbor. The family had all been watching from Greenbank at the entrance to Holmes Harbor and had not seen them leave. We looked along the west side of Holmes Harbor, and called folks along the east side to keep a lookout for us, but <b>didn't see anything</b>, except a few porpoise off Greenbank at around 2:20 pm. 
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>6:15</b>, while strolling with my toddler on the beach in <b>Mariner's Cove</b>, we got lucky and saw <b>two grays</b> a couple hundred yards or so offshore. I saw a couple white pectoral flippers come up, so I am assuming they were feeding. They hung around and were still in that general area, right off Strawberry Point, when we left around six forty pm. I hope to see them again soon! 
<br/>Catherine Beard, Oak Harbor
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:00 am</b> - Sighted <b>one gray whale</b> just off shore south of Sandy Point. It was moving northward along the shore feeding.
<br/>elizabeth heinrich 
<br/>*<br/>
Fred Lundahl of Langley called to report <b>1 gray whale</b> heading north past Whitter Beach off Wilkinson Rd, SE of <b>Langley </b>at <b>8:45 am</b>. 
<br/><br/>
<b>April 20, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
My classmates and I were heading into Mitchell Bay after our first full day at sea when our Captain, Todd Shuster, noticed a collection of whale watching boats off in the distance. We took the opportunity to turn around and were rewarded by seeing a group of <b>transient killer whales</b> by <b>Sidney Island</b>. There was one male orca, which we later identified as <b>T40</b>, with four females or juveniles. T40 is especially easy to pick out because the tip of his dorsal fin is bent over. A few times the whales took a view of the world above them by spy hopping and jumped into the air a couple of times as well. After the initial exhilaration, we began to confer about the behavioral state of the whales.
<br/>The Beam Reach students onboard the Gato Verde 
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>Grays </b>off of the <b>Clinton </b>dock from the ferry at <b>6:40 pm</b>.
<br/>Garet Keller, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Patch [<b>gray whale</b>] was north of Hat Island. We also spotted a large gray whale feeding at Harrington Lagoon around <b>11:30</b>.
<br/>Phil and Debby Ellis
<br/>*<br/>
A lone <b>gray </b>at <b>4:30 PM</b> quite a ways out and heading south off <b>SW Camano Isl</b>..
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a small <b>gray </b>surface and blow 3 times not 100 yards off shore heading north next to Madrona Beach on the west side of <b>Camano Is</b>. Monday around <b>noon</b>.
<br/>Scott &amp; Cyndi Harris
<br/>*<br/>
Early this morning (<b>2AM</b>) I was delighted to hear the [<b>gray</b>] whale blowing. It was south of the south point beach in Beverly Beach, <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, Whidbey Island. I could hear it move a little to the south and then return to the north. Its breathing was very regular; it would blow about every 60 seconds. 
The gray whale was also seen later in the day by a neighbor on April 20th, but not on the 21st.
<br/>Jean Summers, Freeland, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transients </b>today hunting Harbor Porpoise. D'Arcy Is. BC, is in the background.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters 
<br/>*<br/>
Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called to report 7-10 <b>Transient </b>orcas at <b>9 am</b>, east of <b>Race Rocks</b> heading east. 
<br/>*<br/>
Encounter 12 was conducted by Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit with <b>T40 </b>(Captain Hook), <b>T124's and T90's</b> in <b>Haro Strait</b>. They came in past Race Rocks in the morning and travelled up Haro Strait past Moresby Island by evening, making at least two kills enroute. Photos at Center for Whale Research.

<b>April 19, 2009</b>
<br/><br/>
We have been seeing<b> 5 gray whales</b> in <b>Boundary Bay near Blaine</b> for three days in a row now.
<br/>Beau Brandow, Outer Island Expeditions 
<br/>*<br/>
A <b>gray whale</b> came by traveling from NW to SE, ~ <b>8 pm</b>. The tide was pretty low and the whale was feeding near the drop off, NW of Langley. The whale moved right along to downtown Langley.
<br/>Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a single <b>gray whale</b> heading south- east between <b>Langley</b>, WA and Camano Island (48°03'17" N 122°24'10" W) around <b>7 pm</b>.
<br/>Tom Chwojko-Frank
<br/><i>We sent this photo link to Cascadia Research, &amp; got this reply from Jessie Huggins:
This looks like the same whale as the one that has been seen in Holmes Harbor over the past couple of weeks. These are the best photos we've gotten of this whale so far, so we'll look for it again and see if we can find it in the catalogs.

At <b>12:45 PM</b> we were surprised by a small <b>gray whale</b> that suddenly surfaced right next to our boat as we were running at 8 knots coming into <b>Port Hadlock</b> Marina. We immediately shut down and coasted for 20 seconds and had the whale again surfacing approximately 15 feet in front of our Tollycraft before sounding in 58 Feet of water. The whale then went through the passage between the island and Port Hadlock heading north. It then surfaced again between our boat and a following boat and resurfaced within 10 feet of their boat.

At <b>8:30AM</b> saw spout 100 yards SW, probably, heading up from Polnell Point, again. Large <b>gray </b>cruised by and camped out a bit 100 yards NE. I went down to rock spit at Mariners Cove marina entrance. Gray passed entrance right below me and headed/fed in bay shallows near Strawberry Point. Then, continued on to hang out/feed? right off Strawberry Point, until noon. Maybe longer. Even though, I have a limited understanding and experience; I still am persuaded this is a dominant large gray male. When with the other gray last week and when kayaker neared yesterday, it seems to usurp a presence of authority. Raising itself higher in the water [to show how big it is?] type of thing. Have not noticed this behavior before when observing Saratoga grays.

My family and I were enjoying 1st Beach in <b>La Push WA</b> around 6:15pm tonight when we spotted more than 3 gray whales, several adults and at least one calf, playing and feeding off of James Island - spyhopping and partial breeching. The whales were in the area for at least two hours, the calf coming very close to the shallows and the surfers at times. From our binoculars we saw alot of activity, mostly feeding it looked like.

Off my 2nd story deck facing due North on the West end of First Street, <b>Langley</b>, are Gray Whale feeding divets. As the season progresses, these shallow but wide holes increase in number. Between Gedney Island (some call it "Hat") and South Whidbey we saw several <b>gray whales</b>, and some flukes. Cap'n Hughes tells us that although the waters are deep there (accounting for the deep-dive flukes), an underground "hill" exists that's only about 150 ft below the surface. The gray whales, he tells us, like to feed off that hill.

Little past <b>6:30PM</b> was outside and heard/saw spout off Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Island). Shortly, afterwards saw <b>two grays</b> [about 100 yards apart]. No shrimp feeding but plenty of rolling, along with spouts for about 10 minutes. They got together and headed SW towards Polnell Point. They headed towards Polnell. Generally, travelling 50 to 100 yards off shore. A few places they stopped very briefly and showed fins as if they were feeding on sand shrimp. Perhaps, they were feeding on something other than the shrimp at times. They were not always together. The more I walked with them, the more I realized one gray was really large. Louder/larger spouts, with a deep echo hollow type funnel sound after each spout. The other was smaller, but, not because it was young or a baby gray. The larger one had a really large hump/forehead? that stood out when surfacing. Just north of Polnell, they seemed to be feeding on sand shrimp for awhile. Much of the time, quite a distance apart. Then, both headed back NE heading back up Mariners Cove Way. It was nearly two hours since I had first seen them, when smaller gray disappeared and only the larger gray kept heading towards Mariners Cove. At dark, ended where I had started. In front of our place with only the large gray passing by, heading towards Strawberry Point.

My goldens and I were beach walking about 15 minutes out of <b>Langley </b>towards Bell's Beach (near the barge) and were able to accompany what appeared to be <b>three grays</b> about 1/4 of the way out towards Camano about <b>5 PM</b>. Lots of spouting and a few flukes. The feeding patterns seem to be a bit different this year, at least that's what we're seeing. We live right on the beach in Langley and have typically seen whales 100 yards from our bulkhead, no flukes, only at high tide. Now we are seeing whales frequently while walking on the the beach at medium tide. Maybe the ghost shrimp beds are more plentiful further out this year?

Saw spouting and gray going back and forth, possibly feeding on something other than ghost shrimp. No swirling activity. An hour later, leaving car to walk the beach, spotted gray heading back towards Mariners Cove. Then, stop and turn back towards Polnell. At about <b>3:15 PM </b>right in front of me, just 75" off shore (however, seemed so much closer) on a perfectly calm day/secluded bay; gray took a nap. From 3:15 to 4:15 PM, gray napped. Totally, stationary, in same place, in shallow water [maybe a couple of feet below surface.] Every 2 minutes or so, rising up to spout and then going straight back down. Then, at <b>4:15PM</b>, gray headed out to deeper water and last spout seen was right off Polnell Point, heading in Coupeville direction. The low tide was at approximately <b>3:32PM</b> today.

Right at low tide/at exact tidal change, <b>between 2PM to 2:15PM</b>; our neighbor called to inform us of a '<b>gray</b>' right out front. Off Mariner's Cove; in really shallow water where water is still brown [from sand] before drop off. Seemed like 'gray' was in too shallow, lot of its back exposed. Obviously, it knows what its doing. Anyway, no swirling. No typical flipper motion when feeding on ghost shrimp. Ever so slowly heading [SW] towards Polnell Point. Definately, feeding where sand meets drop off shelf or deeper water. But, on what? Interestingly, where this occurred, there were no 'feeding pits'. This beach has a sandy beach that goes way out at low tide. Do not think this late lunch/snack had ghost shrimp on the menu. Possible exception that 'gray' could be scooping shrimp/other? along the sand shelf.

At <b>12:20 PM</b> one of the whale watch boats was in front of Langley observing <b>2 gray whales</b> that were traveling from the NW to the SE.

The tide is way out and I can see the dark line of the eel grass right along the edge of the drop off. The two whales were right in the eel grass. I assume they were feeding. They were moving very slowly and then coming up and raising their heads quite high out of the water (swallowing??). One of the whales was Patch (#49) and the other looked like #531 though I'm not sure about that.

Since my last report on April 9th we continue to see the <b>[gray] whale</b> daily (in <b>Holmes Harbor</b>) still feeding in the same areas and moving in the same patterns. We do see the side fin and fluke and yes the water seems muddier where he is moving around. We also notice many scoters in the area when he is feeding. The wind was blowing and the harbor stirred up, he was 50 to 75 feet from shore on the south end of Beverly Beach and moving in that same back and forth fashion. We were able to witness how quickly he can reverse direction, moving sharply through the water. In the photos we were able to note what looked likes cuts or bites out of each fin - we would be curious to know what you learn from the photos.
<br/>Trisha Brigham, Beverly Beach 
<br/><i>And from Cascadia Research, in response to the photos submitted by Trisha: It does look like that animal survived a fairly recent attack. It does not match any of the other recent "new" whales we have pictures of (in N. Puget Sound). There is a possibility it is a match to a whale that has been seen in previous years on the outer coast (minus the new wounds on the dorsal surface of the body), however due to the image quality and major changes, we are not going to confirm the match without additional better quality images.
Thanks for sending these images, and feel free to keep additional IDs coming, as there seem to be a few mystery whales out there this year!

They approached and passed a sailboat that was slowly motoring along- much to the delight of the two sailors on board! and an update: At <b>12:45</b> a single gray whale swam by, just past the drop off (it is low tide) traveling from NW to SE. It did a deep dive and I got a good look at its knuckles and fluke. It looks like #531.

We spotted a small <b>humpback </b>whale in <b>Clayton Pass</b> between Shearwater Island and Denny Island (North of Vancouver Island) at <b>8:40 am</b>. It breached right in front of the old cannery and spashed some folkes in an aluminum punt. It swam into the Harbour right in front of Shearwater Marine and circled there for a few minutes. It surfaced and blew several times before proceeding out into Llama Pass. It was probably feeding as there are a lot of herring around. What an amazing sight. We are sure lucky to have this in our own front yard! Happy Sightings - Ciao

April 4 - 9 - Since my April 3rd report we have seen the gray whale every day (April 4-9) at the south end of Beverly Beach in <b>Holmes Harbor</b> - Usually in the afternoon and evening, he is alone and continues to leisurely move through the water in the same back and forth pattern, blowing with his back rolling out of the water then under the water for a bit of time . He seems quite content with the feeding situation here! We are getting used to his company.

The morning departure out of Victoria started out as any other normal wildlife tour, but that all changed at <b>1115 hrs</b>. when I lucked out and found a small group of very active Killer Whales a few miles Southwest of Race Rocks Lighthouse. Upon arrival to this very active group of Orcas, I noticed that there was a large Sea Lion in the water with the whales. Whales were ID'd as <b>T30, T30A, T30B, T30C and T172</b>, respectively. (did not include the possible T38 included in the last report). Our location at this point was 2.5 nm SW of Church Rk. (Offshore of <b>East Sooke Park</b>). The five Transients were lunging and thrashing around frantically at the surface trying to stun or knockout this large Steller Sea Lion. For 25 minutes the five whales continually rammed the poor guy from all directions until the Sea Lion magically caught a huge stroke of luck. Somehow the Steller Sea Lion had managed to drift right into the path of a giant floating kelp bed which he immediately took refuge in. I stayed on scene for as long as possible to see what was going to happen to the Sea Lion. At <b>1215</b>, I finally had to leave the area to head back to Victoria to pickup the afternoon trip. As I left the area, the whales were still circling the kelp bed, taunting the Sea Lion. I never did see the final outcome of the encounter and the only two boats that were on scene were Mallard and myself. On the afternoon trip, the five whales had moved well to the East of Race Rocks and were all grouped up in traveling mode doing long dives of 5-8 minutes. We picked the whales up at <b>1530 </b>hrs. 3.5 nm SE of Race Rocks and left them one hour later at 1635 hrs. headed Southwest 3.9 nm SW of Race Rocks Lighthouse.

I probably reached Crown Park in <b>Port Angeles</b>, WA around <b>5:30pm</b>. This park overlooks the Strait of Juan de Fuca just west of the Nippon Paper Mill. The whales were just off the west side of the mill, very close to shore (my best guess would be 200 yards?) At the first sighting, I only saw <b>two Orcas</b>. It appeared to be a mother and a baby orca. I watched them for about 5 to 10 minutes, they were moving slowly; coming up for air and under again. They were traveling west down Juan de Fuca Strait. I got back in my car and drove further down (probably 2 to 3 miles) the road where I could see them again. Then I saw <b>4 orcas</b>. There were possibly 2 females, a baby and a male. The male was huge and had the biggest dorsal fin. The male was white along the dorsal fin, fuzzy white on either side of the "stripe". His dorsal fin maybe, just maybe had been "nicked" along the top, but I thought I saw that on the front edge of the fin (not along the back part). I'm not sure on that. I have been told before by staff at the Nippon Mill that they have seen the Orcas going by. There were two metal fishing boats following the Orcas at a safe distance. It appeared they were taking film or photos of the whales.

From <b>Point Roberts to Montegue Harbour</b> about <b>6 pm</b> we were blessed to see <b>2 adult orcas</b> with a very young baby between them, the baby was very small and had a fairly bright "orange" patch on its side.

Heard blows (from possibly <b>2 [gray] whales)</b> from Bell's Beach (Saratoga Passage, N. of <b>Langley</b>) where we are staying at a B&amp;B. The blows were hard to determine how far out, but I surmise they were around mid-channel toward Camano. We listened for about 40 mins to the occasional blows in the still moonlit night. They were heading south slowly.
<br/>Lynn Brevig, Seattle 
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>9:45pm</b> I heard the blows of what sounded like a single <b>[gray] whale</b> feeding along the shoreline below (<b>Langley</b>). The gray whale lingered 10-15 minutes - sounding like just one whale, not two, but I couldn't be sure. Earlier tonight, about <b>5:30pm</b>, two <b>gray whales</b> were feeding at the bottom of our yard. This time they seemed to be taking their time, swimming their tight circles and feeding leisurely. That's not typically been the case this year for our location. in past weeks they seem to skuttle by. But when the tide goes out there's an abundance of divets, so I guess they are feeding. Veronica, our good neighbor whale-spotter, had left a message that they were here at 4pm (see report below), so that would have them here for more than an hour - west end of First St in Langley.

At about <b>11 AM</b>, While working as Lighthouse Keepers for a week at New Dungeness Spit Lighthouse, Karla Harrison saw a group of <b>four orcas</b> in Dungeness Bay at approximately N48.17974 W123.10975 (datum is that used by NASA's Worldwind. I've been trying to find it without success), directly south of the lighthouse and about 100 yards off the beach. They were moving West when first seen, but turned back to the east after rolling, blowing and displaying their dorsal fins several times. Several of us observed them from the lighthouse tower and Karla took the appended pictures with a Canon Powershot 590 camera. I thought they might be useful in identifying the individuals. In the picture with the male's fin showing, the whale in front of him seems to have a white spot near the tip of her fin. They did not appear to be feeding. After turning to the east to leave the bay and blowing three or four times, they were not seen again. Apparently they moved away without surfacing. After the whales left, we saw two groups of harbor seals quite close to shore, and wondered if they were taking refuge from the orcas, but the latter were not seen.

Further north we found good ol' Patch (#49) traveling with #531 who we ID'd from his repeated fluking! Great conditions and yet again fantastic whales!

Today I saw my first <b>orcas </b>of 2009, and what a sighting it turned out to be! I was out with Captain Jim on the Peregrine this afternoon and we saw <b>8 transients</b> in Haro Strait (we saw a group of 3 and a group of 5 - and there was another group reported further south). First we had the group of three including a pink little calf. I'm not sure who they were, but Ken Balcomb and others got good looks so hopefully they will report who it was. They spent about 15-20 minutes chasing a harbor porpoise around. At times it was hard to tell the calf apart from the porpoise as they both appeared so small next to the two adult females. The grand finale was a huge lunge by one of the adult females that launched the porpoise high into the air! (See first photo above.) I didn't even register it fully when I saw it but I somehow managed to click my camera and capture the proof. That was the last we saw of the porpoise, except for some lungs floating on the surface a little later. Shortly thereafter we were surprised by another group of five Ts. We knew they were in the area but thought they had headed in the other direction, so it was a pleasant surprise for them to pop up in our vicinity. The big male was <b>T14</b>, and I believe he was with the <b>T49s. T49B and T49B1</b> were both in that group, and we left them heading south while the other group of 3 was heading north.

Well, looks like the first part of the trip (onboard NOAA's McArthur II Cruise) was So. Residents and then has been transient fest ever since. After Sunday's Transient encounter we started zig-zagging south and about <b>4 AM</b> started picking up infrequent calls on the hydrophone array - we werent sure on ecotype - we were able to stay with and localize at sunrise and turned out to be another big group of <b>Transients </b>- at least 15 split into in several groups, including the whales we had Sunday afternoon! Candi and Dave are still working on the IDs but at least the <b>T11s, T46Bs, CA195</b> et al,.

Then a gray surfaced about 30 feet away. It went under again and then went right between us (we were about 100 feet apart) with a massive bow wake. It surfaced again about 50 feet away on the other side of us. For the next hour we kept our distance and watched as it worked it's way north, rolling on its side and blowing. It stayed on the Camano side until it got close to Elger bay, when it crossed over to the Whidbey side. There it started going deeper and blowing less frequently.

A new whale in our area. I took it while out with Mystic Sea on Saturday near <b>Bell's Beach</b> - and sent it to Erin at Cascadia since I couldn't figure out the identity. Erin's response:
I am going to have our main gray whale person weigh in on it when she gets in this afternoon. Either way, it's a new whale to the region for this season. Unfortunately, it is not a very healthy looking whale. That large brownish patch on its side is an aggregation of whale lice, and when you start to see them in such concentrated numbers it usually suggests an underlying issue. This whale also looks pretty thin, so hopefully it hooks up with one of the regulars and figures out where the good eating is and can get itself back into shape. We also saw #531 by the north end of <b>Camano Island</b>.

A small <b>gray whale</b> was reported feeding off the south end of the Beverly Beach neighborhood on <b>Holmes Harbor</b>, Whidbey Island at <b>6:30PM</b>. This was during the lowest tide of the day (-0.1 at <b>6:19PM</b>). I have lived in Beverly Beach for almost seven years and this was the first sighting during my time here. I've been told that gray whales used to come into our neighborhood. When I arrived home at <b>10PM</b> and got my neighbor's phone message about the whale, I went down onto the beach and walked towards the area where the whale had been seen. I could hear a whale blowing, but the moonlight was not bright enough for me to see it. I listened to it for 30 minutes. It appeared to be slowly traveling south towards Freeland. There is a herring run occurring in Holmes Harbor. It has gotten things stirred up around here. We've had visiting sea lions (as many as six spotted together last week) and gatherings of up to 23 eagles swirling over the water. I've seen the young eagles plop down on the water.

The Island Explorer 3 found <b>three Grey Whales (#21, #22, &amp; #383)</b> feeding in the shallow waters surrounding the east side of <b>Gedney Island</b> at around <b>11:30 AM!</b> They seemed to be enjoying the beautiful blue skies and warm sunshine that glistened off their slow rising backs! We watched as they returned to the "Gedney Island Ghost Shrimp Buffet" 3 times, with short breaks into deeper waters between feedings! Enclosed is a photo (see above) of some residents of Gedney Island also enjoying the wonder of the 3 giants feeding close to shore and each other.

Jill Hein called at <b>6:55 pm</b> to report one <b>gray whale</b> feeding off Harrington Lagoon, S. of <b>Coupeville</b>, heading south. Then sent this update: The whale report I just called in - it could well have been Patch although couldn't confirm by the fluke - it didn't come high enough out of the water. But there was a large white patch on the right side, just past the dorsal. I had my scope on him - probably at least a mile and a half out.

I was able to spot at least <b>2 gray whales</b> feeding off East Pt., <b>Saratoga Passage</b> at<b> 12:20 pm </b>. I first saw them NW of East Pt, apparently coming from the direction of <b>Holmes Harbor/Baby Island</b>. They were headed to mid-channel, where I watched them feed until after <b>1:20 pm</b> - it appeared they were possibly heading slowly south, still mid- channel at that time.

High winds on the outer coast sent us back in to the Strait of Juan de Fuca late Tuesday. While patrolling the Straits of Juan de Fuca we did hear hear some <b>transient </b>calls for a short while when we were west of <b>Race Rocks</b> - array bearings indicated they were to the east but we were not able to locate the whales visually - hope to head back out tomorrow night.

<b>4:45 PM</b> - Same schedule as yesterday. <b>One gray whale</b> heading north to Mabana, SW <b>Camano Isl</b>, out by the drop-off. He was sending up quite a bow wake rolling into the waves, with the sun shining off his wet back.

There have been <b>2 grays</b> feeding in <b>Elger Bay</b> this morning. They were no more than 150 feet off of shore in 8-10 feet of water. This is the first time I've seen their entire fluke in such shallow water.

This is no April Fools .....<b>3 grays </b>feeding on the flats at Mabana Shores (SW <b>Camano Isl</b>) from <b>7:00am to 9:00am</b>. They are going South.

I just came in from my backyard (<b>East Pt, Saratoga Passage</b>) where I definitely heard a <b>gray whale</b> in the shrimp beds below. It blew a number of times and appeared to stay in the same spot. The last one was so loud that it startled my dog who headed for the door!

I have no idea if this is of interest to you but we had an experience with <b>transient orcas</b> today just to the east of Coronado Island that simply left us gasping with joy.
We are outside of <b>Loreto, BCS, Mexico</b> and on the way to a dive spot on Coronado Island. I spotted whales from some miles away and our experienced captain Pancho and divemaster Rafael managed to catch up with them about 1-mile to the east of Coronado. We slowed down noticing that the pod consisted of one male (huge dorsal) several females and calves. Total number was seven that we could count. We did not harass them and kept a measured distance. We noticed that they were about to turn north so we complied. And then for an astonishing 20-minutes, the females and calves turned to our boat and swam under, around, beside our 24-ft. craft in exuberant fun. It was astonishing. Some would come and crest right beside the boat, barely touching our side. They would retreat and then others would take their place. The male came no where near us and didn't break stride. We did notice that a baby orca was between him and a female however the four whales accompanying them continued to play with us. One other boat arrived and the scene was repeated with them. When they had their fill of us, all the orcas submerged and disappeared.
We expect they were transient because their are no resident orcas here. They had white markings either from tribal conflicts or encounters with Humboldt squid. None of us brought cameras. We are trying to get in touch with the other boat to retrieve copies of whatever digital photos they took. I live in Vancouver and have had other encounters with orcas while fishing and on BC Ferries. Nothing approached today's experience. Bliss.

<br/><i>I noted to Jamie that this sounded similar to an experience reported to us by someone else, where the <b>orcas </b>stayed with their boat until a huge wall of <b>dolphins </b>appeared ahead, at which point the orcas took off to attack the dolphins. These folks believed the orcas were using their boat to remain undetected by the dolphins. -sb To which Jamie replied:
We saw dolphins miles in the distance, discernible only by a slight wake on the horizon, when the orcas left. We didn't see the orcas re-emerge as we were already moving toward the island dive site.</i>
