<b>Humpbacks off Crescent Bay</b>. Mother and calf and lots of action!
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
Off the south end of San Juan Island, around <b>Salmon Bank</b> (48 24.977'N 122 57.291' W), we came across at least <b>three or four minke whales</b>. Two of which were traveling right next to each other! Baleen whales typically travel individually in feeding grounds, so seeing two, thirty foot whales surface one after the other, multiple times was quite a sight!

<b>July 30, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Got to go stand-up paddling amongst <b>grays at Hobuck Beach (Makah Bay)</b> in the morning. Paddled out all alone, sat down and put on a bull kelp seat belt/anchor, and settled in for the show. Spent almost an hour with a healthy adult gray, lounging and playing just off the kelp bed. A harbor porpoise escort saw me out and back in (feeding in the tideline). Made my week! There were between<b> 3-6 grays just outside of the bay for each of the 4 days we were there</b>.  At least one little one.  
<br/>Mira  Lutz

<b>10:30 AM - 4-6 Orcas </b>Hoskyn Channell BC (East side of<b> Quadra Island</b>). Heading north they turned into entrance to Surge Narrows.

<b>One minke whale</b> off Colville Point, <b>Lopez Island</b> headed west at <b>6pm</b>. Another gorgeous day in the San Juans!
<br/>Heather Jo Gulian
<br/>*<br/>
<b><b>11 am - Super pod!!</b></b> Resident super pod off Point no point (near <b>Sooke BC</b>) today. spread out foraging, and <b>heading out west</b> in the middle of Juan De Fuca Strait.
<br/>Josh McInnes
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 pm -</b> Jim Prince called with a sighting of <b>at least five orcas</b>, including 2 adult males, one subadult male, a female and a calf, at 48 03.0 N by -125 26.0 W, which puts it about <b>25 miles due west of Lake Ozette</b>, Olympic Peninsula. They were traveling north in water he said had "lots of king salmon," so these may have been So. Residents intercepting Chinook headed for the Columbia River or other rivers to spawn.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
This time of year we can find female humpback whales and sometimes their calves, usually south of Victoria. Saturday night the Resident Orcas left for the salmon infested waters out near the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Hopefully they'll be back soon. They were gone two days the last time. We got to see the <b>Humpies </b>yesterday, but not today. Too far. West of Pt. Angeles is too far. We only see females and calves because the Humpback males and females only get together during the mating season, unlike Orcas and humans.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>4:20pm </b>PDT, we spotted, what we believe to be <b>two Risso's Dolphins</b> swimming approximately one-half mile southwest of <b>Ketron Island in Puget Sound</b>.

<b>Between Lopez and San Juan Island</b> we spotted <b>three killer whale dorsal fins</b>. It was the <b>K-13's</b>. Not too far from them was a large male, who we recognized as<b> L-87 or Onyx</b>. The whales started traveling along the west coast of the island. We got spectacular views of them, especially when one spy hopped! They were spreading out along the coast, giving us the opportunity to see whales all over. 
<br/>~Kristen, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:45 pm -</b> An update: <b>4 more orcas </b>passing close by Rocky Pt, this group includes a calf. All 8 are continuing south. 
<br/><b>1:18 pm -</b>  Just got a call from Stasha, reporting <b>at least 4 orcas off Rocky Pt, NW Whidbey Island</b>, heading SOUTH down West Beach!

<br/>*<br/>
I was traveling on the <b>4pm </b>Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen Ferry. Just after coming out of <b>Active Pass</b> there were approximately <b>5 whales</b> heading north up the Strait of Georgia. They just seemed to be transiting and they all looked like adults. When a smaller ferry passed they did slap their tails a few times when surfacing. 
<br/>Kerri Larden
<br/>*<br/> 
Today we met up with <b>7-8 members of J-Pod</b> on the southwest side of <b>Mayne Island</b> (Canada) headed north for Active Pass (48°50.93'N, 123°20.55'W). They were resting, traveling in a tight-knit group, surfacing in unison for a few breaths, and then taking deep dives for a few moments. In this group we identified <b>Blackberry (J27), Doublestuf (J34), and Princess Angeline (J17)</b>. We left them headed north around <b>3:30 PM</b>.

<br/>Latitude. 49.782917285°, Longitude. -124.46951129°
<br/><b>4 orcas</b>, including a male, came in very close to shore (20 ft off the beach?). Much tail slapping (at one point 3 tails were waving in the air), spy hopping. Swimming leisurely pace, very shallow short dives. Orcas (and dolphins) regularly in this area. No photos/no ID possible 
<br/>Anne Parkinson
<br/><i>Note: It's not known if these were residents or transients.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:54 - faint calls on lime kiln</b>.
<br/>Selena Rhodes Scofield
<br/>*<br/>  
We traveled west near <b>Eagle Point</b>, San Juan Island (48°26.7577N, 123°00.5170W) when a large dorsal fin appeared belonging to <b>J27 "Blackberry"</b>. Two other males were nearby, <b>J26 "Mike" and J34 "Doublestuff"</b>. These members of J-pod were actively hunting, circling through the water. We saw slapping of pectoral fins and flukes and could hear the splashes. <b>J35 "Tahlequah"</b> and her male calf <b>J47 "Notch"</b> were also foraging for food. It was incredible to see the orcas surface in synchronization and hear their exhalations.

Mecea called at <b>5 pm</b> to say about <b>50 (fifty) orcas are headed east in the Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, past Muir Point.
<br/>*<br/> 
Near <b>Salmon Bank</b>, just south of San Juan Island, our Captain spotted a<b> Minke Whale</b> (48°25.10N, 122°58.03W)! Minke Whales are a baleen whale and approximately 30 feet in length. Salmon Bank is a very productive area and the Minke Whale was busy foraging. The whale seemed to be listening for bird activity at the surface indicating a bait ball of fish had formed. The whale would then come up from below and engulf the bait ball, scaring all the birds into flight. A very efficient foraging strategy; who wouldn't want their own sous chef.

<br/><br/>
My brother and I believe that we witnessed the birth of <b>a new baby orca calf</b>. We were traveling North from Nanaimo and had entered the South end of the <b>Malaspina Strait near Pender Harbour</b> when we spotted some whales ahead of us. We immediately stopped the boat and took a number of pictures as the whales passed by us at about a 300 yard distance. It was 10:24AM on July 24th, 2012. We did not know at the time what we had witnessed. We only figured it out after inspecting the pictures - later that day - to see what we had gotten. To our surprise we had witnessed the actual birthing process of a baby Orca. We could see a whale roll to her right side, with another whale right on her underside. We saw one of the whales (possibly the Grandmother) help the baby up into the air. We then saw the other Orca's pushing or eating the afterbirth. What a surprise it was.
<br/>John Keyes
<br/><i>Note: These transients were provisionally identified as <b>T122 </b>(the young male sprouter), and <b>T46, T46B, and T46E</b></i>.

<b>Humpback whale BCX1057 west of Race Rocks</b>.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:15-2:00 -</b> Major fog off sooke as we travled <b>west from Victoria</b> in search of whales. We went all the way to <b>Carmanah point</b> and thanks to a fellow whale watcher Jeff Lamarche found the same transients <b>T60s </b>we had found two days prior. We stayed with them for two hours. They killed one harbor seal. Dive average: 2.5 minutes.

On the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>, we came across <b>at least seven killer whales</b>. Both members of <b>J and L pod</b> were around. We identified <b>L-86 "Onyx," J-16 "Slick," and L-92 "Crewser."</b> The whales were milling about, not in a hurry to go one direction or the other. We had amazing views of their white saddle and eye patches, especially when one orca spy hopped, bringing its head out of the water!

I took a whaling tour aboard Orcas Eclipse Charters based on Orcas Island. It was a great day for viewing and enjoying the beauty of the Orcas that were in the vicinity. Of special note was <b>Love Play between K20 Spock and J26 Mike at 14:45 off Eagle Point</b>, San Juan Island. This was identified by the onboard naturalist, Deborah Martyn, Orcas Eclipse Charters. This was an awesome experience!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:45 am - </b>John Rogstad of Washington State Ferries called to relay a report from the Chelan that <b>orcas are frolicking in Rosario Strait</b>. 
<br/>*<br/> 
Headed south out of Cattle Pass, we saw a large collection of birds including rhinoceros auklets and Heermann's gulls feeding at the surface of the water. Then we saw the spray. <b>Two minke whales</b> were feeding nearby (48°25.432N, 122°57.013W). Minke whales commonly consume small fish and krill. After observing these mammals for a few minutes, we turned west in search of the largest member of the Delphinidae (dolphin) family, the ORCA!  Three miles off <b>Eagle Point</b> of San Juan Island (48°24.816N, 123°52.887W), we saw <b>several orcas actively feeding and diving.  J26 "Mike" and J28 "Polaris"</b> were out and about.<b> L85 "Mystery"</b> was also hunting for salmon. The residents were showing flukes-- cartwheeling and tail slapping.  Some spy-hopping was observed.  Splashing and rolling too.

<b>Transient killer whales T60</b> were off <b>Sooke BC</b>. We found them at Secretary rock haulout foraging. They circled secretary rock and church rock. They made 2 kills, both of harbor seals. They carried one seal for about a mile. We left them at race rock passage. Average dive time was 1.37 minutes. longest dive times lasted 4-5 minutes. 
<br/>Josh McInnes 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:30 pm - 4-5 orcas off Secretary Island</b> ... headed east toward Race Rocks.

<br/><i>Note: - not sure if these were residents or transients.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
In the morning <b>J and K pod</b> whales were reported coming down <b>Boundary Pass</b>, but just north of Henry Island they turned around and headed back north, up <b>Swanson Channel</b> toward Active Pass. That afternoon Susan and I joined Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research to find them, which took us all the way to <b>Active Pass</b>. At about <b>2:30</b> we suddenly found ourselves surrounded by <b>J and K pod orcas</b>, who seemed to saying goodbye as they parted ways for a while.

We departed Friday Harbor heading north, and did not have to travel far. We caught up with <b>three killer whales</b> just on the north side of <b>Henry Island</b> (48° 36.720'N 123° 12.300'W). We watched for a while before seeing blows off in the distance. Three, <b>four more killer whales</b> were in the area. They changed direction, so did we. Then, all of a sudden we saw <b>at least twenty dorsal fins</b> slice through the surface of the water, all less than a body length from each other! We also noticed there was a large group near shore. The sky was full of their misty exhalations. I got to see my second <b>greeting ceremony</b> in two days when the two large groups came towards each other. They seemed to synchronize their surfacing as they lined up. But, as they met I saw something different from yesterday: the whales circled each other once before moving off in the same direction they came from! It was spectacular! All in all there were <b>at least thirty whales, from all three Southern Resident pods</b>. Again, they were being very active, lob tailing, breaching, and spy hopping. It was difficult to identify individuals since fins and saddle patches were everywhere, but we were able to distinguish <b>J-27 Blackberry, J-14 Samish, L-87 Onyx, L-86 Surprise, and K-21 Cappuccino</b> out of the wave of dorsal fins in the groups.
<br/>~Kristen, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris
<br/>*<br/> 
On last night's sunset cruise we caught up with two groups of about <b>20+ Southern Resident Killer Whales</b> headed south in <b>Rosario Strait between Cypress and Blakely Island</b> (48°34.46N, 123°46.05W). They hadn't gone far since the greeting ceremony earlier that day, but you could tell the excitement had worn on them. They appeared to be resting, moving at a steady pace in unison, only coming up for 3-5 breaths before taking long dives. From what we had identified, it was members of <b>L-pod including Onyx (L87), Gaia (L78), and Crewser (L92)</b>. We watched them rest for a while, but they must have sensed our curiosity because eventually they spruced up, spyhopping, swimming on their sides, waving their pectoral fins, and lobtailling. The setting couldn't have been more perfect to embrace these animals. With Mt. Baker glowing in the background, the sun setting, and only 2 other boats around, it really felt like it was just us and them.

A pod of about <b>8 orcas</b> was off of <b>Washington Park </b>(south of Anacortes) this morning at <b>10:00</b>. Others at the park reported another pod on the other side of the park.

<b>K Pod</b> finally returned today! It was great to see them back. <b>J's and L's</b> shared my enthusiasm...what an awesome day! Whales as far as the eye could see...extremely loud vocals, touching, rubbing, breaching...the whole nine. One of my favorite days I've ever had. It was so amazing to watch the interaction between all of them.

We reached the whales at 48° 36.73'N 122° 44.88'W (<b>northern Rosario Strait, between Cypress and Orcas islands</b>). At first we spotted a large group of probably ten or more killer whales, but as we looked around, there were <b>several large groups</b>. Dorsal fins were slicing through the water's surface everywhere! Big ones, small ones, sizes in between! We were witnessing a super pod; <b>members from J, K, and L pods were present, at least twenty, if not thirty whales</b>. We watched as the whales spread out horizontally and started swimming towards each other. The whales then split again into two groups. Both groups were active. You name the behavior, we saw it. They were spy hopping, lob tailing, pectoral slapping, cartwheeling, back diving, and yes, BREACHING! One small whale breached six or seven times in a row! Additionally, we heard their vocalizations both above water and underwater via the hydrophone, as well as their distinctive blows from either side of our boat. All this activity in tight groups made it difficult to identify individuals (honestly, there was so much to watch I forgot about trying to figure out who we were seeing), but we were able to ID the super distinctive 35 year old male <b>L-41, Mega, as well as L74, Saanich</b>.

<b>11:00 am -</b> Went out on the chartered Western Prince with documentary crew, headed for Rosario Strait and found <b>J and K pod north of Lummi Island</b>. Not much luck with IDs but there were many passes as they moved SW toward Orcas Island and down Rosario.

<b>1:30-2:30pm -</b> A pod of <b>Orcas in Desolation sound (upper Georgia Strait)</b>, passing by the falls in Teakern Arm then along the north shore of the arm before heading north along the Redonda west coast. We were with them for almost an hour, with them swimming toward us, then along with us. Many spy hops, breaches and twirls. It was truly an amazing gift for my 70th birthday. We also heard from several folks on Cortes that the pod or another were seen heading north past Cortes Bay , then past Seaford earlier in the day.

Not long after passing <b>boundary pass </b>we saw one dorsal fin, then another, then three more! There were about eight to ten southern resident killer whales, traveling close to each other. They were moving north along Pender Island (48 36.54'N 123 04.94'W). We watched as three whales spy-hopped, one after another, followed by a full, body out of the water, breach! The whales then moved close to shore, slowly diving and surfacing. In this group naturalist Jenny and I were able to identify members from both <b>J and L pods</b>, including <b>L-72 Racer, J-27 Blackberry, J-28 Polaris, L-25 Ocean Sun</b>.

As we traveled through Cattle Pass, we headed west and observed members of <b>J-pod</b>, particularly two males, <b>J-27 "Blackberry" and J-39 "Mako".</b>  These two were foraging and feeding near <b>False Bay</b> (48°28.679N, 123°06.621W). We also spotted <b>a minke whale</b> south of where the orcas were foraging. The minke had a few slow surfaces and then went for a deep dive.

Two friends and I saw what we think was <b>one adult and one calf Orca </b>off the mouth of Rendsland Creek (<b>south end of Hood Canal</b>), near high tide. Our location is 123deg7'W Long and 47deg23'N Lat. I saw only the splashes, but my friends said they saw one large fin and a small fin, and the splashes also looked like two individuals. My impression was that they were moving northward toward the mouth of the Canal, but I'm not positive. Sorry I can't give you more details; they were quite a ways offshore.

We saw <b>3-5 killer whales</b> between the Amphitrite lighthouse (<b>Ucluelet</b>, BC NW of Strait of Juan de Fuca) and the red whistle buoy at <b>7pm </b>heading East. I took some pictures where you can clearly identify them as Orcas but not good enough to be sure if that were Transients or Residents. I suppose they were Transients.
We were shore based so distance was quite high and the sea was a bit rough.

Last Saturday, approx. <b>4pm</b>, my wife and I were looking for whales around the <b>Salmon bank</b> area, between cattle point light house and the outer salmon bank buoy. We observed the whale watching group 3 to 4 miles north west and thought we had missed the orcas. The sea state was very lumpy, 3 to 5 foot swells. My wife spotted a fast moving fin and did not know what it was, due to the sea state. All of a sudden <b>the whale</b> was right next to our boat moving faster than I have ever observed a whale to move. Our boat is 16 ft wide by 55 ft long. By now we are dead in the water with the engine off. The whale looked like a sub, it was so wide and fast . We saw the whale several more times by watching the feeding birds move out of the whales way. The fin was very distinct, we finally found the fin match on the computer and <b>totally agree it was a fin whale</b>.

Continuing around to the west side (of <b>San Juan Island</b>), we ran into some fog and slowed. We could make out some boats, so we stopped and started to look for whales. Through the fog we heard the distinctive "powoof" of <b>a killer whale</b> surfacing to breath. We then saw a single female pass by. The fog began to lift, and we traveled further north. Just south of Lime Kiln we encountered five more killer whales, one of which was J-34, "Doublestuf."

We caught up with <b>killer whales</b> just as they were swimming across <b>Turn Point</b>, off Stuart Island, heading west. The whales were not just slowly traveling by; they were porpoising out of the water, moving fast! All together there were four of them. Two were right next to each other, their bodies flying out of the water in full synchronization. Four more killer whales followed shortly after. There were two large males in this small group. We could see their massive dorsal fins at least four hundred yards in the distance before they too made it to Turn Point and went on by. Finally, we came across two other female orcas. Their bodies also were coming out of the water, providing the perfect opportunity for a young guest to snap a fantastic photo!

Tonight at <b>6:38 PM</b> a group of kayakers who had paddled to <b>Burrow's lighthouse (south of Anacortes </b>on the east side of Rosario Strait) saw <b>two whales</b> headed south from the lighthouse bluff. It's on Burrow's Island, west side tip, so this is south of Washington Park, Anacortes, near where the ferry leaves from, and across from Shoal Bight (that would be across the channel and south). Hole in the Wall is a kayak club - we were having a dinner paddle from Washington Park to the Burrow's island and back (not very far, just a couple of hours). I don't think we could have seen then unless we'd been up on the lighthouse bluff. These were my first whales this year, so I was pretty excited - you could just see them on the edge of the fog bank, very lovely. Lots of harbor seals in the kelp below the lighthouse. There was one smaller one, then a larger one. From the fin size and shape, and the length and behavior of the whales - we are <b>pretty sure they were two Minke's</b>, one smaller in front, and a larger one just behind.

<b>Whales were spread out between Stuart Island and Lime Kiln State Park</b>. A mama and calf were first spotted  off <b>Henry Island, near Kellett Bluff</b> (48°34.60N, 123°12.03W). Moving extremely fast, almost to be confused with porpoise, they were headed south to catch up with the rest of the pack. Also rode with another female and <b>Onyx (L87)</b>.

I took my 5 yr old Scottish grandson Francis out whale watching today - on Mystic Sea - and we had some wonderful viewing, <b>J22 </b>surfaced right next to the boat, along with J26. Almost too close for photos - what a treat. It was a fairly rough day on the water, but the wind subsided somewhat and we saw roughly a dozen whales, very spread out, south of <b>False Bay</b>. Mostly the whales were too distant to ID, but we heard Granny was in the area but we didn't get a good look at her. But Oreo (J22) was very cooperative as she swam right by our port side.

We saw our first, large Orca dorsal fin slice through the water at 48º52.88'N 122º56.61'W. It was <b>L-87 "Onyx."</b> We thought he might be alone, but there were two females, J-2 "Granny" swimming along with J-8 "Spieden" not too far behind him. Everyone was super excited not only to see the 101 year old matriarch of the southern resident killer whales, but also to see the difference between the tall, triangular dorsal fin of the adult male killer whale compared to the smaller, lunate shaped dorsal fins of the females. And while all this was going on, Mt. Baker was the backdrop, giving the opportunity for amazing pictures.

When I got to Land Bank's Westside Preserve, all the whales were heading north around <b>3:30 PM</b> in one fairly tight group. Not all of them continued north, however, and some whales never made it as far as Lime Kiln. From <b>4 PM - 7 PM</b> whales slowly made their way back south. Most whales were going on long dives and zig-zagging every which way, presumably foraging. Others were in a social mood, with some rolling around at the surface. They were spread out over several miles by this time. Just before 7, a few whales headed south with a purpose, porpoising against the strong flood tide.

We first saw a huge male who looked to be alone, but after a few more minutes we realized that there were whales scattered everywhere. The male was later identified as <b>J-27 or "Blackberry"</b> and another male around was identified as <b>J-34 or "Doublestuf." </b>Then we saw a group of four females swimming close together. They surfaced almost in unison, allowing us to hear their powerful exhalations before diving back under. Finally, before having to head back we watched as the whales moved close to each other closer to the shore. They started to become playful: cartwheeling, lob tailing, and swimming upside down, allowing us to see their beautiful white undersides.

Members of the <b>Southern Resident Killer Whale population</b> were observed along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> near Lime Kiln State Park (48°31.53N, 123°10.47W). We first saw <b>L87, "Onyx"</b>, an adult male that frequently spends time with members of <b>J-Pod</b>. Closer to shore we identified <b>J26, "Mike"</b>, another large, mature male. We suspected J26 to be foraging as he was changing direction quickly and frequently; his nearly 6 foot tall dorsal fin slicing through the water at all angles as he maneuvered. Another group of at least 10 whales from J-Pod were traveling in close proximity to each other, near shore. This group included adult females, one sub-adult male, and one calf; among them was J27, "Blackberry", a 21 year old male. The whales were slowly traveling north before they decided to perform a number of surface behaviors: one whale spy-hopped, not once but twice then the calf entertained us with a wee breach, while a few other whales lobtailed.

In the <b>evening </b>we were out on a friend's boat sailing between <b>Lagoon Point and Marrow Stone Island (south Puget Sound)</b>. On several occasions we saw "blackfish," two mammals, which were surfacing 3 to 4 times then diving. They were completely black on the parts we could see, and the dorsum was tightly curved. It was so quiet out there, hardly any other boats, that we could hear them breathing. There were lots of birds out there as well so it was probably  feeding time.

We were fishing off the Olympic peninsula and saw <b>three Orca whales</b>, two adults and a juvenile. The photos are not great but maybe they can be of some use. We saw the flyers asking for information about killer whale sightings at the La Push marina. Hope this information is useful.
<br/>Time:<b> 2:30</b> (approx.)
<br/>Location: <b>Needles by Second Beach</b>, not far from La Push marina, Washington

<b>Southern Resident Killer Whales</b> today! Caught up with about 7 slowly foraging members of <b>J-Pod</b>, including Granny (J-2), Blackberry (J-27) along with Onyx (L-87) on the west side of San Juan Island at 48.27.388N 123.03.597W. We stayed with them until peeling away at the light house at <b>Lime Kiln</b> to complete a circumnavigation of San Juan Island. Caught a quick sighting of <b>2 Dall's Porpoises</b> close to Kelp Reef too.

Crazy day today! <b>6 Orca at Stanley Park in Vancouver</b>!! I made a 180 turn and just over an hour later we found <b>T49B, T49B1, T49B2, T49A, T49A1 and T51</b>. I have never seen them so close to the city! News cameras all over, they made a kill right along the shoreline of Jericho beach and a couple spyhops after. No sign of T49A's other two calves A2 and A3 so that doesn't look too good. It was an awesome show and our passengers were blown away....so was I!

<i>Okay, photos are pretty fuzzy and distant, but it does look like <b>two Risso's dolphins</b>, definitely smaller than a minke, and tallish falcate dorsal fin like a Risso's. I don't think we can say 100%, but 95% sure. Really hard to imagine what else they could be.

<br/><b>July 2 -</b> About <b>7:30am</b>, I saw the two whales again. I live on <b>Puget Sound on Sunrise Beach Rd NW (Steamboat area) across from Sunset Beach on the Cooper area</b>. The water this morning is very calm. I heard the whales. They were traveling together south towards <b>Mudd Bay</b>. The whales are dark grey and smooth. Their dorsal fin is slightly curved towards their tail. I haven't seen their head or tail. I don't see any spots on their back. It's 9:00am now, and they have been swimming around Sunset beach for about an hour.

<br/><b>July 1 - </b>About 2:30pm, my neighbors and I saw what appeared to be the same 2 whales only this time in <b>Eld Inlet</b>. The whales were across from Sunset Beach (often called Evergreen State College - Goeduck beach) only on the Steamboat Island side where we live just south of Flap Jack Point. I was on the shore so I didn't see the whales up closely. However, it appeared they were traveling very close together this time showing only their dorsal fins and a small amount of their back. It seemed to me the whales were more lethargic  Almost like one of them was trying to help out the other. They traveled south, then north, and then south. I'd say they showed themselves maybe 10 times. Then I didn't see them come up again.   
I'll keep you posted if I see them again.  Feel free to email me if you have questions.
<br/><b>June 28 -</b> About <b>3:00pm</b> I was boating just north of <b>Boston Harbor near Olympia</b>. I saw 2 whales. I believe they were Minke Whales. They were traveling together. I slowed the boat engine down to neutral to get a better view. They showed only their backs and dorsal fin. I didn't see their head or tail above the water line. Their backs appeared to be about 4 feet wide. They surfaced maybe 5-7 times and then didn't come up again. They traveled north and then south. They seemed to be having fun. I'm not sure if they were feeding or just swimming about.

While underway on our sailboat (under power), we encountered a pod of <b>4 and maybe 5 orcas in Admiralty Inlet</b>.  We were just south of <b>Bush Pt </b>and they were headed in a northerly direction that favored closing in on the shoreline.  It was approximately <b>1230 pm</b>. Our initial sighting was one (I would guess male) who seemed to be interested in approaching us. He went out of his way and closed to within 200 yards before heading back to join the others.

<br/><i>This is probably the same transients that were in Puget Sound on June 30, as yet not identified.</i>
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:36 pm - 6-8 Orca</b> sighted headed south between <b>Mosquito Pass and Lime Kiln Point</b>. At least 1 male with group.

This afternoon <b>all of J-Pod and the few L-Pod whales</b> headed north past <b>Land Bank's Westside Preserve</b> on the west side of San Juan Island between <b>12 and 1 PM.</b> A few hours later, the group split, and about half the whales came back south, passing <b>Land Bank between 3:30 and 4:30 PM</b>.

We continued northwest towards <b>Stuart Island</b> and encountered <b>Onyx, L-87</b>, slowly traveling the same direction, just south of <b>Turn Point</b> (48°39.931N, 123°14.114W). As we continued into Boundary Pass, we encountered <b>members of J-pod, including Granny, J-2</b>.  Four females were traveling close together as they hugged the south side of South Pender Island (48°42.999N, 123°14.294). After observing these fascinating mammals, we returned south and cut between Stuart Island and Johns Island.

At about <b>8am </b>there was a very dispersed group of at least <b>8 orcas</b> traveling slowly east to west past I<b>ceberg Point on South Lopez</b>. The whales were sufficiently spread out that it took about an hour for all of them to pass.

We had an amazing day on the water today in our neck of the woods. Our Transidential Gangs all showed up today. <b>T002C's/T086A's/T090's/T100's/T101's and 102 Gangs</b>! The coolest part of the day though was this guy!!! I did a triple take as i was running and had to come to a stop fast! We found a Sea Otter just off of the <b>south end of Quadra Island, in Sutil Channell</b> head south slowly about 1/4 mile from one gang of Transients! As far as I know and I am waiting for confirmation on this its the first sighting on the inside coast in our area if not ever then in a very long time. One of the other operators out that saw it has been on the water as a fisherman on the inside coast for 50 + years and has never seen one!! Well to say the least I am very excited with this find! Picture has been sent to Jared towers (DFO) and he has forwarded it to the DFO Otter specialist. I am awaiting an answer back with some more info.
