A <b>J pod</b> sighting sent by John Ford of DFO's Pacific Biological Station: We observed <b>J pod </b>southbound <b>off Nanaimo</b> at <b>1800 </b>. They were heading (south) towards Dodd Narrows when we left them at dark.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>3:45 pm -</b> Sounds like<b> T20 &amp; T21</b> 4.4 Nautical N.E of<b> Race Rocks 1445</b>.
<br/>Ron Bates
<br/>*<br/>
Yay!! Just saw <b>a Gray whale</b> from our office window,<b> 4:35 pm</b>! It appears to be feeding of the very tip of Fox Spit/East Pt, in <b>Saratoga Passage</b>, near the entrance to Holmes Harbor. I think it may be moving north, but not sure yet - cool!!

This morning on the 1:15 ferry from Vancouver about halfway to Langdale we saw a good size pod of <b>white-sided dolphins</b>. They were so close to the ferry. It was beautiful to watch them playing in the water. They were headed north.
<br/>Gerry Chabot
<br/><br/>
<b>February 27, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
Unidentified pod of <b>7 - 9 Orca</b> were spotted up around the Sointula / Port McNeill area (north of Johnstone Strait) heading West during the morning.
<br/>Anonymous
<br/>*<br/>
We spotted one whale, (<b>small fin</b>), traveling South in <b>Port Susan Bay</b>. Sighting on the West side of Port Susan Bay near Port Susan Terrace Beach at about <b>12:45PM</b> today. We were not close enough for any distinguishing characteristics. We also spotted a whale which may have been a <b>Humpback </b>in the same area on January 31st.
<br/>Bob &amp; Mary Pelland
<br/><i>This sounds like it may be the Humpback whale we've had sightings of in Puget Sound recently - those of you in the Pt. Susan/Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage area, let us know if you see this whale - thanks!</i>

Fred Lundahl reports <b>a gray whale</b> was seen from the <b>Langley </b>Inn at <b>7 am</b>, heading south.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:20 pm -</b> At least<b> 20 Pacific White-sided Dolphins </b>were playing in the Queen of Burnaby's wake heading towards <b>Powell River</b> BC. A few leaps and surfing movements then they turned to follow the ferry's wake towards Comox. I spotted a few off to top of <b>Texada </b>around <b>6pm</b>, but I guess the rest continued with the ferry.

Thursday morning at<b> 7:30 </b>my dad saw a large mystery whale at <b>Pt. Defiance</b> (Tacoma WA). It was heading towards the narrows from the slag pile. A boat house employee saw it also. Surfaced 4 times and had about <b>a foot tall dorsal fin</b>. humpback? minke?
<br/>Bryan Owens
<br/>*<br/>
At about <b>1305 </b>the Condor Express saw <b>six transient killer whales</b> (including a very young calf), 18 miles from the <b>Santa Barbara Harbor</b> (CA), near the shipping lanes by the Anacapa Islands. They were generally headed northwest. One of these whales is CA155; she is a seldom-seen transient, first photographed in 1983 in Monterey, CA. The new mom appears to be CA126; she also is a seldom-seen transient, first sighted in Monterey in 1994. Two of the other whales were previously sighted at least once (2007) off of Monterey, CA; they have the temporary designations of N170 and N170A.
<br/>Alisa Schulman-Janiger, California Killer Whale Project, ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project: Director/Coordinator
<br/>*<br/>
We saw a group of killer whales near channel islands near <b>Santa Barbara </b>CA today (4 or 5) with a baby -took lots of pictures - they seemed to be feeding, were very active.

Just got a call from Betsy Greene, reporting a whale with <b>a small dorsal fin</b> heading out of<b> Rich Passage</b> (east of Bremerton) at <b>3 pm</b>. She had also seen it earlier at <b>9am</b>. It sounds a lot like a <b>humpback</b>, which raises the question: was the whale seen in Rich Passage this morning at 9 am from the ferry also a humpback?
<br/>*<br/>
We have the great fortune of living on the beach for the winter, just at the west edge of <b>Langley</b>. <b>Two gray whales</b> yesterday evening, 50 to 75 yards off the bulkhead enjoying shrimp beds. Watched them and listened to the spouts between <b>5:30 and 6:15 p.m</b>.
<br/>Susan Cyr
<br/>*<br/>
Heard a few <b>calls on LK</b> about <b>10:10pm</b> just before the ship noise started in there as well. Kind of hinders the orca's conversation and the listening atmosphere.
<br/><b>9:43pm - J pod S4 calls</b>. Also heard echolocation.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
Thanks to Alisa for alerting us to <b>orca calls</b> (some sound like J pod) on the <b>OrcaSound hydrophone</b> (NW San Juan Island) - still hearing occasional calls at<b> 9:35 pm</b>.
<br/>Orca Network
<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:10pm -</b> There are calls on <b>Orca Sound hydrophone</b>.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks 
<br/>*<br/>
We received a call from Lon Kamann of Vancouver Island, reporting <b>a pod of what appear to be Transient orcas south of Nanaimo, BC </b>- in NW Bay, Parksville, chasing sea lions around the logging boom Lon is working on at <b>~10:20 am</b> this morning. There were 5 - 6 large fins, and several smaller fins. One orca chased a sea lion right into the bay and near the logging operation! They appeared to be heading in a northerly direction toward Denman Island.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:43 am -</b> We just saw it again -- a she, I think. [The <b>killer whale</b>] is in front of the <b>Bremerton ferry dock</b> headed towards the Sinclair Inlet.
<br/><b>10:27 am - </b>I saw a single <b>killer whale</b> heading south in <b>Dye's Inlet</b> towards the Port Orchard Marina. We have seen killer whales in this area before (about four months ago).
<br/>Steve Schmerfeld

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyC8C_JLGf8&amp;feature=youtu.be"><b>A REPAIR JOB INSTANTLY REWARDED (Video)</b></a> ... At Chuck Point, Barkley Sound, we repaired a broken fishery boundary marker to protect the closed areas and to have the fishermen avoid fines. A group of killer whales came to check the repairman.
<br/>Peter Mieras
<br/>A follow up with IDs from Heather Lord: The photos you sent me [extracted stills from the video] show T2C (Tasu), a female born in 1989, T2C1 (Rocky), T2C2 (Tumbo) and T2C3 (born in September) are all her offspring. T2C1 is the male, and we don't yet know the gender of T2C2 but it does have scoliosis, which is why the dorsal fin is so wobbly. We also don't know yet if the calf T2C3 is male or female. It's wonderful to see the group live and well.

John Miller of WA State Ferries relayed a report of one Gray whale [<i>possibly a <b>humpback whale</b></i>] just east of <b>Rich Passage</b>, at the south end of <b>Bainbridge Island</b> at <b>4:50 pm </b>this afternoon.
<br/>*<br/>
Not sure what we were seeing but there was <b>a whale</b> [<i>possibly a <b>humpback whale</b></i>] on the Tacoma waterfront for a while this <b>morning</b>....was wonderful to see, blows and some tail flips but looked smaller.
<br/>Carrey Fincham-Galloway
<br/>*<br/>
Saw [<b>gray whales</b>] at <b>5pm </b>in front of Shangri-La (just south of <b>Penn Cove in Saratoga Passage</b>) in very shallow water for almost 15 min till lost sight.
<br/>Ingrid Sechrist
<br/>*<br/>
Yay! Just got a message from Mary Pacher up the road here in Greenbank, and at <b>6:45 pm</b> they were hearing <b>1, or possibly 2, Gray whales</b> blowing in <b>Saratoga Passage </b>off North Bluff Rd. It sounded like they were heading south (towards us!).
<br/>*<br/>
The Hood Canal<b> humpback</b>, first seen January 27, was seen again yesterday, February 23.  See Photo of the Day, above.

<b>2:55 pm -</b> Lori Wilson just called from <b>Potlatch State Park,</b> near Great Bend in Hood Canal, while watching the <b>humpback </b>tail-lobbing and breaching as she spoke.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6:14 - </b>Laura Swan reports: sounds like it might be K-pod and J-pod. Splashes, clicks, and squeaks.
<b>6:07 -</b> Laura Swan reports hearing echoing <b>orca sounds and clicks on Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>, getting louder. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:36 -</b> Jeanne Hyde heard <b>J pod calls on the OrcaSound hydrophones</b> (NW San Juan Isl.)

From comment on Watching Our Water Ways blog: The <b>humpback </b>is definitely still around. I was with a group of scuba divers at Sund Rock (just north of Hoodsport) on Sunday 2/19 and we spotted it during our surface interval around <b>11-11:30am</b>. It was very close to shore and surfaced twice as it headed south. We got a good look at its back and tail flukes as it appeared to dive just off the point. I¹m 95% sure it was a young humpback; I¹d guess maybe 20 ft or so. It was close enough to shore that I think we would have had a good chance of seeing it if we had done our first dive along the south wall an hour later than we did.
<br/>*<br/>
We went out for a nice paddle today around <b>Gedney Island</b>, and on the way back to <b>Mukilteo</b>, we ran across <b>two gray whales</b> feeding, easily identified by the heart-shaped spout. They were about 1.5 miles S-SE of Gedney (~3 miles from the Everett waterfront). They would surface, take a breath or two, then hump the back and go down for 2-4 minutes.  We never saw any flukes, so they must not have been diving to deep.  We watched for about 15 minutes and they pretty much stayed in the same general area.

<b>8 am ish</b> - They were off <b>Beaver Point on Saltspring, two groups of +/- 6 individuals</b>, roughly heading north. Fun to see them on a drizzly foggy morning! Bumblebee queens are out, bluebirds are back, currants &amp; Indian plum kinda in bloom and <b>J pod</b> creeping about--must be spring!

<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:20 am -</b> Southern Resident <b>calls S1, S2, S10 on Orcasound hydrophones</b>. They may be headed south in Haro Strait.
<br/>Scott Veirs
<br/>*<br/>
Via Christopher Dunagan, Kitsap Sun: Don't know where "official" observers now have the status of the <b>humpback </b>but we definitely saw one again about <b>1:50 this afternoon</b> in EXACTLY the same spot as in January, just <b>north of the Great Bend</b> and toward the east shore. Both Jim and I saw it this time, with its tail up and also showing one side fin. It came to the surface only about three times before disappearing. We got two photos but neither show much detail ... going under at the time ... but the tail  appeared to match the one photographed at Dabob Bay. Jim got a better look at the side fin and described it as looking like a humpback's.

Two very active <b>pinnipeds </b>were seen from the Bainbridge Island/Seattle ferry in mid channel this afternoon. Unusual: <b>Very dark black, much smaller than our normally seen CA Sea Lion males, no sagittal crest on head</b>. Very active diving, and jumping together as if hunting fish. Three possibilities: Juv. CA Sea Lions, Rare visiting female CA Sea Lions or rare visiting Northern Fur Seals. If anyone has seen Fur Seals in the Central Puget Sound Please contact Orca Network.

I was sitting on the deck enjoying the sunshine at CWR when <b>a small humpback popped up</b> just off the reef at about <b>1645</b>. I saw it blow once, then ran to get my camera, and then saw about four blows as it headed slowly north up SJI before it arched (did not fluke) and disappeared.

Part of <b>J Pod</b>, including Granny, came through the <b>San Juans</b> today. <b>Orcas Landing, San Juan Channel, Speiden Channel, and Haro Strait</b>. There were headed toward Victoria around<b> 3:30</b>. These pics are from Speiden Channel, around <b>1:30</b> today. Yes, Granny was there. No pics but I saw her as did Jeanne Hyde.
<br/>James Mead Maya
<br/>*<br/> 
We left [<b>J pod</b>] at <b>1350 </b>on the east side of <b>Battleship Island heading southwesterly into Haro Strait</b>. We saw almost everyone despite the whales being very spread out and taking long dives at the beginning of the encounter.
<br/>Dave Ellifrit
<br/>*<br/>  
I was out with John Boyd and Melisa Pinnow this afternoon (GIANT thank you's, btw!) and we had a wonderful encounter with <b>J Pod</b> in <b>Haro Strait</b> around <b>14:50ish</b>. We saw <b>J19, J27, J28, J31, J32, J41, and J46</b> (pretty sure <b>J39 </b>was in there too, but need to look at my photos some more). 
<br/>Katie Jones
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:55 pm -</b> John Boyd just called from near <b>Kelp Reef</b> (across<b> Haro St.</b> from San Juan Island) with <b>J pod</b>, heading south, very spread out.

<br/>*<br/>
<b>9:00 am -</b> Brian reports 8 orcas between<b> Orcas and Shaw Island</b>, heading west.
<br/>*<br/>

<br/>*<br/>
Monte Hughes called to say he saw <b>5 orcas</b>, including one male, on the east side of <b>Guemes Island at 12:40</b> today. They looped all around Guemes, which is very unusual, and are now headed west across Rosario Strait.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:48 - </b>Tammy Cihak called to say she is seeing the <b>humpback, or humpbacks, from Jorsted Creek, 1 mile south of Hamma Hamma</b>, at mile marker 322, out in the middle of <b>Hood Canal</b>, not splashing, just traveling slowly northward.
<br/><br/>
<b>February 11, 2012</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>11:47 -</b> [<b>Orcas</b>] appear to be just north of the <b>south end of Whidbey</b>. They moving steady north up Admiralty Inlet, kind of strung out. 
<br/>Connie Bickerton
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:20 -</b> They are out mid channel, again now moving northerly <b>between Edmonds bluff and Eglon</b> (mid Kitsap). Mid channel in that spot is pretty far away. 
<br/><b>10:35 - </b>still mid channel heading north across from <b>Edmonds </b>ferry terminal. Shallow surfacing. 3-4 adult males, 4-6 others including that little one (L117) if the same groups from yesterday. Tail slaps along the way.
<br/><b>10:09 am -</b> They are still mid channel approaching Kingston ferry heading steadily north 
<br/><b>9:25 am -</b> a group of <b>orcas</b>, probably the same ones in the south Sound yesterday, headed slowly north between <b>Port Madison and Shilshole</b>.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks
<br/>*<br/>
Tracey and Ian Cobane, who were staying at the beach cabin at Bold Buff today, saw a group of about <b>9 Orcas</b> swimming south in <b>Sansum Narrows</b> (Salt Spring Islands, BC) about <b>11 am</b> this morning. They returned, swimming North about 3 pm. Ian thought there were 3 big males, and a few babies, splashing and jumping (feeding? Playing?)

<br/><br/>
I live in Olympia Washington near the end of Johnson Point. Looking down Dana Passage and <b>Henderson Inlet</b> from out deck at about <b>11:30 am</b>, we saw the fluke of an Orca.  At one point, two flukes (dorsal fins?) were seen at the same time. They were quite a distance from us, so no further identification could be made. They were heading west, toward <b>Harstine Island</b>. We watched for another 30 minutes or so, but never saw them again.  
<br/>Noreen Justinen 
<br/><i>Given the recent sightings of Risso's dolphins in that area and the lack of orca sightings, these are probably Risso's dolphins.</i>

Great day with the whales today. Flat calm water and tons of tail slaps ricocheting across the sound. After the [<b>orcas</b>] passed through the <b>Vashon Ferry lanes</b> just before <b>2PM</b> they spent bit of time milling off of dolphin point then headed south and passed very close to shore along <b>Dilworth point</b>, on the east side of the island, at just about <b>3 pm</b>. They continued South, heading on to the KVI beach area and ultimately <b>Pt. Robinson</b> - where they passed at about <b>5:15</b> ( missed that one darn!) Last report had them still southbound.

Endangered orcas in Haro Strait 18 hours after sonar use.
<br/>Acoustic analysis, <b>Lime Kiln State Park</b>, Network news, Orcasound lab, southern residents:
<br/>Sounds of southern resident killer whales were detected late in the night on Monday (2/6/12), the same day that the <b>Canadian frigate Ottawa used sonar in their U.S. critical habitat starting at 4:49 am for about 40 minutes.</b>. The <b>calls most often used by K and L pods were automatically detected</b> first at the Orcasound hydrophone array (around 22:45) and then on the hydrophones at Lime Kiln State Park (11:04-11:14), suggesting that the pods were heading south during that period.
<br/>The calls recorded at Orcasound are interesting in part because they are audible over a continuously squeaking ship that has peak power in the frequency range of the calls. The most recognizable call in this set of detections is the S16 call which often indicates the presence of K pod.
<br/>The Lime Kiln recordings have much less ship noise. Many <b>S19 calls</b> are audible (indicating L pod may have been present), along with whistles, buzz trains, and some S10 calls. Around 23:11 the signal to noise ration is very good during a series of excited variable and S19 calls that are interspersed with echolocation clicks.

Transient orca encounter began at <b>3:05p.m</b>. Seven transient orca - <b>T85, T85A, T85B, T85C, T90, T90B and T90C</b> - heading north in <b>mid San Juan Channel</b>, approaching Flat Top and Spieden islands. They turned left and entered Spieden Channel and continued to move along the north shoreline of Spieden Channel, stopping for a few minutes to interact with some Steller sea lions. They passed by the south side of Sentinel Island and Rock, moved out <b>into Haro Strait and continued moving north 4:15pm</b>. For more see my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

We received a call from Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries, relaying a report from a ferry capt. of <b>~6 orcas in San Juan Channel</b>, just west of Yellow Island, northbound at <b>2:30 pm</b>.

<b>4:49 am.</b> sonar pinging occurred in the waters off the south end of San Juan Island. The sonar got louder as the ship was heading in what appeared to be a northeasterly direction.  The sonar lasted for about 40 minutes.  The US Coast Guard in Bellingham was called and asked to pursue the incident. There was a Canadian Navy ship in the area. There is a short sample of the sonar sound on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
This morning Jeanne (Hyde), our (OrcaSound.net) computers, and other listeners heard sonar pings on the live hydrophones between <b>4:42 and 5:08 am</b>. Preliminary analysis suggests the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and southern Haro Strait were ensonifed by a Canadian frigate.  It's possible there was also sonar use early in the day (and late 2/5/12) near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The blog post regarding the (now confirmed) use of sonar by the Canadian Navy is now published.

Near <b>Eagle Harbor (Bainbridge Island)</b> we encountered <b>6-8 transient orcas</b>-all appear to be female with a calf or juvenile included.

<br/><i>Dave Ellifrit looked at the photos and identified these individuals:
<br/>This is the T100s and T124s. Individuals I can say for sure are there: T124, T124D, T124E, T100, and T100B).  Jared Towers had these plus T87 up near Nanaimo about a week ago.  There are other Ts around.  I saw some video (from, I think, the last several days) from PS that had what looked like the T85s (who Jeanne saw from shore up here a couple days ago) plus an extra (third) young bull and others.  The vid was not good enough to make any positive ids.  Thanks for the pics.  Cheers,  Dave</i>

Was on the Bainbridge <b>2:05 p.m.</b> ferry. Two groups of <b>Orcas </b>about a half mile off <b>Wing Point, Bainbridge Island</b>. Groups were about 500 yards apart. They were both North of the ferry lane and also moving North. Didn't have my usual camera gear or binoculars, but my all too distant i-phone video shows maybe 6 in one group and at least 5 in the second group. Not sufficient resolution to make out good fin definition or possible youngsters. But, it was the talk of the ferry crowd, and I was amazed at how many said it was the first time they had ever seen whales in Puget Sound! Stunning weather and a pretty decent whale display ...

We were in kayaks and very close. Scarily close, really. They surprised us when they surfaced and they were moving very fast. We counted 14 of them in two distinct groups.

You've probably already have heard this, but I just saw an article in the My Ballard blog (with photos and video) about Orcas sighted from <b>Golden Gardens </b>beach in Ballard, right next to Shilshole Marina and the Ballard Locks. It would be great if someone can ID this group!  In the video it almost looks like there's a baby with the group (small fin initially seen right near the rear)?  We've lived here for 23+ years but this is the first Orca sighting from this beach I've heard of.  It's amazing how close they came to the small group of what appear to be tiny training sailboats.

They swam right by<b> Golden Gardens at 3:02pm</b>, about 300 yards off shore, near the big, round white buoy where the sea lions linger and through a Lazer regatta.

This afternoon at approximately<b> 1:30 </b>we observed a <b>Humpback Whale</b> breaching, rolling, pectoral slapping and generally have a great time! The location was approximately 300 yards off our home ( 9300 block/Hwy 106) on the south shore of<b> Hood Canal</b> generally across from Sisters Point. We are approximately 3-4 miles past the Great Bend. 
Our visitor appeared to be a juvenile (maybe the same as in Dabob Bay recently) and in our 10 minutes of observation we felt there was only one. We have watched our unexpected visitor continue to head in the direction of Twanoh State Park towards the closed end of Hood Canal and Belfair. We have observed numerous Humpback whales in the past at Neah Bay while salmon fishing and of course in Hawaii. Never have we seen a Humpback in this or any other part of Hood Canal. We have seen the transients orcas in 2005 and a couple of years prior and a few Grey Whales but never a Humpback.

I live in <b>Totten Inlet</b>, in deep south sound. This morning I sighted two animals I believe to be orcas out front of our house. I can't imagine a mom and calf being alone, so maybe these are some other whales with similar-shaped dorsals.  I saw them first about 10:45 AM and again about <b>1 PM</b>. They did not appear to be feeding actively but cruised south in Totten to about Deepwater Point and then turned around and headed out of the bay toward Steamboat Island. They typically went down for only half a minute or so and then surfaced. I was able to capture one dorsal fin, which is quite far away, but it might be of some value. It was over half a mile away, so it's not real clear even with the telephoto. Have there been any other sightings recently in south sound?  They appeared to be swimming mostly close together, and both appeared to have the female shaped dorsal. One animal was smaller than the other.
