<h3><center>October 2010 Whale Sightings</center></h3>
<b>October 31, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Orca Network received a call from Chrissy McLean at the Pt Townsend Marince Science Center - a visitor there said he had seen 1 large whale that he believed to be an <b>orca </b>from the <b>Keystone/Pt. Townsend ferry</b> (must have been around <b>9 am</b>). He apparently only saw it 1 time, and no direction of travel was given. 
<br/><br/>
<b>October 30, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Traveling on the Anacortes to Sidney ferry, we are pretty sure the fast moving flurry of activity seen from the starboard side west of Spieden was <b>a dozen Pacific White-sided Dolphins</b>. Also a couple more noted approaching Friday Harbor.
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
The Strait of Juan de Fuca, south and west of Victoria BC seems to be a magnet for Humpback Whales. Although there wasn't much sun around between <b>12-3pm</b> we were blessed with <b>6 Humpback Whales</b> in two separate groups. Our sightings included, 'Heather', the female with her calf and Split-Fin once again. They were foraging a little and traveling very close together at times.

It was one of those special days in late October, when the clouds above gave way to periods of sunshine. A little warmth was welcomed as were sightings of <b>four Humpback Whales</b> south and west of <b>Victoria</b>, this afternoon at <b>1pm</b>. We saw a female, affectionately called 'Heather" by some of the skippers out of Victoria. This name has been coined due to the letter 'H' within her undertail/fluke markings and was traveling with her 2010 calf. They were taking long dives and traveling slowly west. Farther south we observed two others and Mark Malleson identified them as 4 yr olds that have visited these waters over the past few years. One was 'Split-Fin', with its dorsal fin somewhat chewed up, and the other, I called 'Split-Fluke' since it sported a tear to its right fluke, when observing its undertail markings. These familiar ' teens ' were in traveling mode too, taking long dives and several surface breathes. It is always so amazing to see these gentle-giants just off the Victoria water-front.

<br/><br/>
<b>3-4 orcas</b> reported headed south near <b>West Seattle</b>, south of the Fauntleroy Ferry at <b>10:35</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
I was watching the water off <b>West Seattle </b>in the morning. A little before <b>10 am</b> I did see a small pod of <b>Dall's porpoise</b> heading south. That was north of the Fauntleroy Ferry route, but if they continued on to the south they would have been in that area around 10:35.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond 
<br/>*<br/>
Approx 10 minutes ago (<b>10:20</b>?), just had one <b>minke </b>foraging off the north side of <b>Hannah Heights</b> (W San Juan Island). It came incredibly close to shore, surfaced and then disappeared. Typical slinky minke! :):)
and also just got word there were/are <b>two humpbacks</b> two miles south of <b>Hannah Heights</b>.

<br/><br/>
I found Transient orcas <b>T063 with T065 and T065B</b> near <b>Race Rocks</b> at <b>1600 </b>hrs.
<br/>Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria B.C. 
<br/>*<br/>
I have a poster that requests sightings of all orcas, so I thought I would email about <b>2 orcas</b> (one male and one female) I saw today off the <b>Big Sur coast in California</b>. The location was off Laffler canyon. The approximate location is: N 36.19, W 121.73. They were about a mile from me while I was standing on shore. There is a sea lion hang out spot in this area where there were hundreds of sea lions in the water and on shore today. This was at about <b>0945</b>. I was watching them with binos and didn't get a look at any saddle patch or distinguishing features. They did not appear to have a successful feed and were not preforming any behaviors while I saw them. I stayed there for about an hour and they never really left the area but also were very elusive, most of the time very hard to locate. The sea was very calm, there were no white caps and a swell smaller than 5 feet. There have been orca sightings in this area that I know of, but this is the first time I have seen them in big sur. It is possible that there were more than the 2 orcas but I am not sure and can only confirm the one male and one female.

On a return trip to Victoria, B.C. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered the <b>T2's and T123's</b> mid <b>Haro Strait</b>, just south of Stuart Island at <b>4:44 p.m</b> (48° 38.272 N; 123° 14.709 W). The whales were traveling north. The encounter ended just off Turn Point at 5:40 p.m.(48° 40.640 N; 123° 15.027 W).

<br/>*<br/> 
Al Luneman reported lots of <b>orca </b>fins milling about, in very choppy seas, roughly on a line between Partidge Pt., Whidbey Island, and Protection Island, at <b>3:50 pm</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
Chrissy McLean at PTMSC just called - <b>2:25 pm</b> - she has sighted the <b>orcas</b>, including a few males (saw J-1 from <b>Point Wilson</b> several times), heading NW out of Admiralty Inlet, just north of Lagoon Pt.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:03 pm:</b> Wow! Some great <b>calls </b>on the <b>Port Townsend hydrophones</b>!
<br/>Candice Smith (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:07 pm:</b> hearing it too!
<br/>Robert Steven Ciaccio (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:58 pm:</b> Pretty sure I am hearing calls on <b>Port Townsend hydrophones</b>, nothing visual though.
<br/>Chrissy McLean, PTMSC
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>1:54 pm</b> we began hearing faint <b>calls &amp; whistles</b> on the OrcaSound <b>Pt. Townsend hydrophone</b>. Soon the calls became much louder and clearer as the So. Residents headed out of Admiralty Inlet. 
<br/>Orca Network, Whidbey Island 
<br/>*<br/> 
As I was coming home from Stuart Island I heard we had some <b>Transients </b>nearby, and I had the opportunity to watch the <b>T2s</b> and<b> T123s</b> foraging in <b>Haro Strait</b>. I think they made one kill (lots of direction changes and spyhops). I left them at <b>1730 </b>mid Haro Channel approaching Turn Point heading North. Center for Whale Research and NOAA were still on scene.
<br/>John Boyd SSAMN Marine Naturalist on a day off!
<br/>*<br/>
These Ts (<b>T123s &amp; T2s</b>) made no effort to move away from the freighter. I've seen them countless times deal with ferries, freighters, and crazy recreational boaters in the same nonchalant way. Steller Sea lions, on the other hand, really have something to worry about. There were about 25 of them within 5 miles of these Transient, mammal eating, Orcas. I've seen Orcas attack and eat Stellers on many occasions.

Peter Furman reported seeing a large <b>pod of orcas</b> (~15 - 20) heading south past Useless Bay/Double Bluff, west<b> Whidbey Island</b> around <b>9 am</b>. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Port Townsend (hydrophone)</b> is proving to be a great test bed for Val's auto-detection algorithm. I thought these were false positives, but not so upon listening carefully - Seems the <b>SRKWs </b>came in to Puget Sound between <b>6:09 and 06:13</b>.
<br/>Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound
<br/>*<br/> 
When Ed and I left the bluff at <b>Richmond Beach Saltwater Park (Shoreline)</b> at <b>4:00pm</b> and could still spot the <b>Orca </b>heading in a southerly direction. A few were still east of mid channel, out from the RB park and could see many farther south past Carkeek (N. Seattle) and heading towards West Point lighthouse at Discovery Park. All the while seeing breaching, tail lobbing, porpoising. Quite spread out the entire time we were watching from <b>2:15-4:00pm</b>, in groups of 2-4.
4 pm: Still watching them head south, we were just at kayu kayu park just south of point wells, stll coming. Have seen 4 mature males, and another 15 females/yonug boys and some calves. Yes ,same as Dave (see below report) -tail lobs and earlier a couple of breaches. Foraging, milling, feeding, porpoising. General direction south. more to come.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Brooks, Edmonds (via Facebook)
<br/>*<br/>
<b>1:55 pm</b>: <b>Orcas</b>! At least two spotted just off Point Wells, headed south towards <b>Richmond Beach (Edmonds, WA</b>) . Guessing more are out there!
<br/><b>3 pm</b> update: Many more continuing to swim past. Looked like mom and a young 'un about 10 minutes ago. Now some bigger adults, including a large male who showed me two big tail lobs (seen through binoculars). All directly east of the SF mid-channel buoy, maybe 0.5-1 mile off Richmond Beach.
<br/><b>4 pm</b>: 6 more <b>orcas</b>, 5 females and a youngster, all seen over the last 5 minutes. The last group of 4 had 1 female in the lead, with 3 others following just behind her, all coming up for air as a group. Looks like they're having fun out in those waves! All sightings still due east of mid-channel buoy. About 10 minutes ago I saw a couple of amazing breaches by a juvenile orca. The first onto its belly, the second on its side/back. Seems to be hanging with 2-3 other females. Also, one large male closer in, circling and cruising back and forth.

<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call from Patty Michak about <b>10 am</b> reporting <b>orcas </b>heading south past <b>Point No Point</b>, N. Kitsap Peninsula into Puget Sound. At <b>10:45 am</b>, she sent this update: I would estimate that <b>20++ whales</b> went past Point No Point from 10am-10:30am, numerous males, and female and calf pairs. The number was hard to estimate as some would turn back and circle around. Looked like some feeding as there was some circling and lunging and the gulls gathered around, but most were moving into Puget Sound. A couple spectacular breaches! Sorry no photos they were just too far offshore. A great way to start the week! Thanks,
<br/>Patty Michak, MarineView Fisheries Consulting, Inc., Hansville, WA

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered <b>J's, K's and L's</b> off <b>Race Rocks </b>at <b>1:27 pm</b> (48° 17.080 N; 123° 29.051 W). The whales were spread out heading north east. The encounter ended off Albert Head at 3:03 p.m.(48° 21.491 N; 123° 23.298 W) with the whales still heading toward Haro Strait. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>also reported in <b>Active Pass</b> on Sunday <b>afternoon</b>. 
<br/>Andrew Lees (via Facebook) 
<br/>*<br/>
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC called to report they had met up with members of all three pods of Southern Resident <b>orcas </b>at approximately <b>2 pm</b> off Seabird, near <b>Discovery Island, BC</b>. They were able to obtain three fecal samples today. It first looked like the whales were going to head up Haro Strait, but by the end of the day it appeared they may be headed toward Puget Sound.
<br/>*<br/>
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales relayed a report from Jeff LaMarche that Southern Resident <b>orcas </b>were inbound from <b>Sooke, BC </b>at <b>10:30 am</b>, at 11:45 am he had an update that it was Js and Ls, likely near Race Rocks still heading in.
We received an update from Giles at 5:30 pm - apparently members of all three pods are present, they are in the eastern part of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, closer to the Olympic Peninsula side.
<br/><br/>
<b>October 23, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
Orca Network received a call from Jonathan, reporting a sighting of <b>1 male and 1 female orca</b> heading west about 100 - 200 meters off Salt Creek Park, 10 km west of <b>Pt. Angeles mid-afternoon</b>.
<br/><br/>
<b>October 22, 2010</b>
<br/><br/>
We have been seeing a single individual (identified as a <b>Minke </b>by the photo above) for the past week at the mouth of Discovery bay feeding on Salmon. Diagnostic photo attached. Last sighting 10.22.2010. The Minke is moving about the bay quite nicely and does not seem to be in distress from an injury. It makes a circuit from Protection Island to Cape George, Diamond Point and around again. Hopefully we will have some better photos next week.

A tuna fisherman, Richard Nehmer, called to report watching 8 <b>orcas</b>, including at least one male, killing and eating <b>Pacific white-sided dolphins</b>, 45 miles west of <b>Crescent City CA</b>, the afternoon of 10/21. He said it occurred at a temperature edge of 4 degrees difference (where cold La Nina water upwelling along the coast meets warmer Pacific surface water) and he thought the kw's had cornered the dolphins there. He said after the predation event there were dolphin lungs left on the surface. He said the 8 orcas split up into two groups after they finished the dolphins. He also said there were other dolphins there during the event that were not eaten, which from his description could have been Northern right whale dolphins. One of the crew took photos and he'll try to get them emailed to Orca Network.

We got the word from Sandra Pollard that she saw <b>orca </b>blows far to the south at 3 pm from Shore Meadows Drive, just north of Freeland on Whidbey Island. Sandra and I boarded Orca, the 19' outboard on loan from the Center for Whale Research to shoot IDs. Departing Lagoon Point at 3:50, we zig-zagged southwest, then southeast, but saw no whales all the way to Pt. no Pt., then got the message that Mark from DFW had seen them between Pt. no Pt. and Foulweather Bluff, so we did a U turn and covered the same track but closer to mid-strait back north, but still no whales. Way up near the south end of Marrowstone Island we did a scan and I saw one tall male dorsal fin slowly disappear, way back south, halfway to <b>Double Bluff</b>. We slowly veered over that way and accompanied J's and their L friends for an hour as they meandered their way north, till <b>6:15</b>. There were lively groups and more mundane travelers, some foraging, a few spyhops, lobtails and distant breaches. They continued northward as the sun set over the Olympics. We'll await official IDs from the Center, but I shot photos of about 20 J's and two L's. The highlight was seeing J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny, side by side, away from the other groups, moving steadily northward.
<br/>Howard Garrett, Orca Network
<br/>*<br/>
Having spotted blows and breaches from Mutiny Sands (SW Whidbey Island) at <b>3.00 pm</b>, I joined Howard in a fast ride south down 
<b>Admiralty Inlet</b>. Howard will put in a much better report than mine, but suffice to say that meeting up with <b>J's and L's</b> traveling north off Foulweather Bluff we had a little bit of almost everything on yet another glorious fall day. We could hear the chatter on the hydrophone above the whales exhalations as they passed by with a spy-hop or two, a baby breaching, a Mum nursing and some 'hanky panky' for good measure. We heard high pitched squeaks as a couple of youngsters playing together crossed our bow. It doesn't get much better than being surrounded by whales as the sun sets on Whidbey with a full moon rising above.
And an addition to report from 10/19: I'm glad you mentioned the <b>Harbor porpoise</b> in your report as I forgot to tell you about those when I was at Shore Meadows on Tuesday. At least three just offshore. 
<br/>Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Heather here on the SE corner of <b>Marrowstone </b>- Large male and at least 2 others moving quickly north up <b>admiralty inlet</b>- directly east of me at <b>5:35 pm </b>- male seems to back track once in a while. 
<br/>Heather Hoins, Marrowstone Island
<br/>*<br/>
We saw about <b>10 orcas</b> from my house a bit south of <b>Bush Point</b> today, about <b>5pm </b>or so, headed northward. Not too much fancy swimming; they seemed to be moving quickly with no fooling around. One was much smaller than all the rest and so likely a baby. Possibly a male or two, but they were pretty far off and so it's tough to be sure. A small boat looked to be following more closely than it should have been but I'm not a good judge of distance.
<br/>Anonymous report, Freeland, Whidbey Island
<br/>*<br/>
Orca Network received a call at <b>3:42 pm</b> from Mark Millard of WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, reporting <b>orcas </b>spread out for nearly two miles, from <b>Pt. No Point to Foulweather Bluff</b> - they were so spread out it was difficult to get a good count. They seemed to be traveling more than foraging, and heading NW toward Pt. Townsend. At least three males were observed.
<br/>*<br/>
Sandra Pollard of Freeland called Orca Network to report a pod of <b>orcas </b>off <b>Mutiny Bay</b>, SW Whidbey Island at <b>3 pm</b>, closer to the other side - first it appeared they were heading north, but later looked like they were milling &amp; foraging. Likely the Js &amp; Ls we saw yesterday.
<br/>*<br/> 
Same group of 6, same place &amp; time,<b> 3:30-4:30 PM</b>, off <b>Double Bluff</b>. Instead of heading South into Puget Sound, they continued feeding and slowly drifting toward Mutiny Bay. Watching from Hansville, they were too distant to see markings, even with binoculars. After seeing them 2 days in a row, I'd love to watch every day but will be out of the area until Sunday
<br/>Van Bergen, Hansville 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>3 Humpbacks</b> today about 6 miles south of <b>Hein Bank</b>. They weren't doing much but it was amazing because of stillness of the water and all the porpoises in the area. We ran into some thick fog on the way home but managed to find some Sea Lions. Here is a picture of the Humpbacks and the Sea Lions.

<br/><br/>
Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research spotted <b>T20 and T21</b> off <b>Kelp Reef</b> from the Center at <b>1:15 p.m</b>. We shortly departed Snug Harbor and encountered T20 and T21 just south of Sidney Island, B.C. at <b>1:53 p.m.</b> (48° 34.624 N; 123° 14.776 W). At 2:21 p.m. we observed the T's chasing a harbor seal. The attack appeared to be successful. The encounter ended just off Halibut Island at 3:05 p.m. (48° 37.580 N; 123° 16.128 W) with T20 and T21 heading slowly north.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Orcas </b>moving from <b>Admiralty Inle</b>t into Puget Sound between Northern tip of <b>Kitsap County and Whidbey Island, 3:30-4 PM</b>. First seen from Norwegian Point Park (Hansville), close to Whidbey Island in vicinity of Useless Bay, cruising back &amp; forth. I think there were 6, in 3 pairs, although there could have been only 2 pairs with one of them doubling back a lot. At least 2 males. Visible with naked eye but very exciting through binoculars.
Then they all headed South into Puget Sound, very fast. We moved to Point No Point to join a small crowd already watching from there. They seemed to be making a beeline for the Edmonds area and soon were too far away to see. Other lookers said they had seen them in the same area several times in the past few days.

From <b>Edmonds </b>bluff just north of the Ferry from <b>5:30-6:40</b> we watched the <b>Orca</b>, they were spread out across mid channel and stretched to Possession Sound from the point south of Useless Bay then heading slowly in a general direction northeast. Crossing in front of Cultus Bay and to south end of Whidbey. General milling, some feeding behaviour (we think) and I did see one breach, Yay! At the same time saw <b>15-20 porpoise</b>, porpoising along in a mostly single-file-line 1/2 mile off Edmonds bluff north of Ferry. Either Harbor or Dall's. Exciting afternoon down here.

We were wondering where the whales went today and were listening to the <b>Pt. Townsend hydrophones</b>, just wishing and hoping, when we finally began to hear a few <b>Southern Resident calls</b> at <b>1 pm</b>. They only lasted a few minutes, and we'd had no reports of whales today, but we alerted folks in the area and then headed over to the west side of Whidbey to take a look.
We departed from Lagoon Pt. and thanks to the tip from Sandra (see report below) we knew the whales were heading south down Admiralty Inlet, and we saw them foraging and breaching off <b>Bush Pt.</b> at about <b>2:45 pm</b>. The leaders were approaching Double Bluff by 3 pm, closer to the Whidbey Island side, but we could also see small groups spread out all across Admiralty Inlet. By 3:15 pm the orcas had moved closer to the Kitsap side, and were spread out between N of Hansville to Point No Point, still foraging. At 3:40 pm, the whales continued south, VERY spread out in small groups from Double Bluff to Pt. No Point to Possession Pt., then at about 4 pm they just all suddenly disappeared! We had to head back to Lagoon Pt. at that time, so left them heading toward Puget Sound.

Heeding the 'Orca Call' at <b>1.20 pm</b> that Orcas had been heard on the Pt Townsend hydrophone, I headed for <b>Bush Point, Whidbey Island</b>. I heard the whales before I saw them, it was quite surreal. Then into sight came Ruffles in the lead with other family members not far behind, traveling steadily south. Susan and Howard were at Lagoon Point so glad to have confirmation of the direction of travel. One of the babies breached in front of me as if to say, 'hey, look at me!' The only sounds besides the exhalations on this beautiful fall day were the slaps of tail-lobs hitting the flat calm water as the Southern Residents passed close by the point before disappearing into the haze. Magical.

<b>Orcas </b>just south of <b>Bush Point</b> (SW Whidbey Island) almost to mutiny bay but not quite. Neighbor just hollered up to me to come look! Really BIG orcs, lots. Feeding and putting on a show just south of my place. The Windmill area will be excellent viewing.

I have found the whales via hydrophone <b>Orca Sound</b>. a few far away calls at the <b>Lime Kiln site</b> and at the more northern Viers site, they are loud and clear, heading south along <b>San Juan Island</b>. Today we went all the way up north to the west entrance of <b>Active Pass /Mayne Island, B.C.</b> and as we arrived (<b>2:15 pm</b>), there THEY were, barreling towards us, the first group just about to come around the point, heading WEST of all things, and right along the shore! We immediately shut off the engines and a parade of leaping, spy hopping, tail lobbing, and pec slapping family groups continued for twenty minutes passing along the emerald green shores' placid waters. The sea and air was so still we could smell the salmon oil from their breath! All three pods represented. Though it was rather visually overwhelming to catch ID of individuals, what with their sheer numbers and swift pace and closeness, I did spot J1 &amp; 2, K21 &amp; 40 , new mom K12 and tribe, L2 or 26 and LOTS of others including little'uns and teen sprouters. Including some photos that might give you all a flavor of this amazing golden experience (see above photo). I will look forward to this fall,winter, spring, Orca Network reports to know what's happening until I'm out on the sea again 2011 season. Now, <b>7:40 pm</b> : whales very audible at both North and Lime Kiln hydrophones.

Around <b>6p</b> my wife and I observed 2 (possibly 3)<b> humpback whales</b>. They were traveling north from <b>Baynes Channel</b>. We saw them when they rounded 10-Mile Point, and observed them about 200 feet offshore traveling toward Johnson Reef, surfacing every 20 seconds. They were apparently in transit, not feeding. We have never previously seen humpbacks, but did see a head hump on one of them.

My wife and I were fishing at <b>Jefferson Head</b> this morning when about a zillion <b>orcas </b>rolled through South to North. There must have been about 60 of them, many female and young whales. They were spread out from West Point to Kingston to Edmonds, all across the Sound, in groups of one, two, three, four, and five. They were in no hurry, and seemed to be playing, with lots of tail slaps, spy hops, and the occasional breach. What a treat for close to two hours to have these beautiful animals visit us.

<br/>*<br/>
Today from <b>4 to 6 pm</b>, <b>Admiralty Inlet</b>, north Puget Sound, we observed <b>J's, K's and some L's</b>, probably 50 altogether, travel, forage, frolic and socialize their way north. We went out for 3 hours with orcas today in a 19' outboard to get photo IDs, so we were part of a day in the life of those particular orcas. We dropped the hydrophone in to listen to the ecstatic chatter. Unbelievable, but real. They were spread out in small groups for miles, all across 4-6 mile wide Admiralty Inlet. Now and then a breach, or a lobtail, or a cartwheel would raise a big black and white body into the air. Fins bent in all directions. Sometimes two or three whales would be rolling on each other, upside down or sideways. 24-year old K21 Cappucino and his 47-year old sister K40 Raggedy were streaming around each other in some kind of jubilant dance now in its 24th year. The new baby born this past week to L82 poked his pinkish head out beside mom. We could see many blows and fins in the distance, but very few up close. They were that spread out, moving north after a day in Puget Sound.

From about <b>6:25pm to 6:55pm</b> a dozen? or more groups of killer whales swimming south with the ebbing tide, backlit by a salmon colored waning sunset reflecting in the low clouds and on the still water. Pectoral slaps, tail lobs, and breaches sounded off the water. I could identify J-26 Mike (my favorite teenage whale!), and J-1 Ruffles, when they slowed to forage a bit in a reef off of Hannah Heights. The amount of whales suggest some K's and/or L-Pod whales too.

There were Southern Residents milling off of Hannah Heights, and right in with them were two humpback whales. A third humpback was visible much further offshore just north of Beaumont Shoals. The orcas eventually headed south.

On October 10, 2010 between 2:30 and 3:30 PM I and my neighbors watched a single [minke] swimming east and west in <b>Hammersley inlet</b> about 1.5 miles east of Shelton and between Munson and Miller points. The inlet is about 0.25 to 0.5 miles wide here and at the tide showing, about 30 feet deep. The minke surfaced many times at about 5 minute intervals, usually heading in a different direction each time; I did not see any jumping or other play, just rising to spout and then going back down. This went on for about an hour. I saw no white patches. I reported it to Cascadia Research.
<br/><i>Jessie Huggins of Cascadia Research reported that Cascadia finally received a photo of the "mystery whale" that has been reported in numerous locations around south Puget Sound over the past few weeks - from the photo provided, it is believed it is a Minke whale.</i>

A lone <b>whale </b>was hunting (I guess) in front of my house (just west of Walker Park) on <b>Hammersley Inlet</b> yesterday. I first spotted it about 30 yards off shore around <b>2 p.m.</b> It was swimming in a large circle and only surfaced briefly, every once in a while. It was hard to get a good look at it unless I was looking in the right direction when it surfaced. Even then, it was hard to tell if it was an Orca or not. It was black, had a fairly long body, small dorsal fin and could see no white or any other markings on its body. I assume that it was the same whale spotted off of Harstene Island. It was still in the area around <b>7 p.m</b>.

It is always good to see<b> T14, 'Pender</b> ' traveling as usual mostly, all alone. He was heading in from the west. We located him east of <b>Race Rocks</b> heading slowly toward Victoria.

I believe that it is part of the CA116's. The bull with the chopped off dorsal was not seen that day but according to Alisa Schulman-Janiger he normally is with them and they are the most frequently seen group in the area.

It's nancy and tony out on <b>harstine island</b> again. (btw - we are on the SOUTH end near briscoe point looking across dana passage to olympia (dickenson point area according to the placemat chart; lol). the channel isn't very wide but not well lit at night. (some moon light would have been helpful). but last night and night before (oct. 7th and 8th) we heard them out there again, but no visual. We are such rookies at this that its hard to say but it seemed to us both that there was only 1 or maybe 2 whales each night. our biggest thrill yet was (10/8) around 5:00. we actually got a glimpse of 1 in the daylight! :) what a thrill! he was cruising fast. just kinda barely surfacing to get quick breath periodically but not stopping or showing off like the north sound whales seem to do - lol we didn't even get a flick of the fluke. haha but we were so grateful for his (her?) appearance just the same. we are quite sure it was alone (do u call that a rogue?). he moved quickly and efficiently. seemed like he stayed right near surface but only came up slightly a couple times to breath. but he even did that quickly and without a break in stride. his dorsal fin was pure black (are they all?) but we couldn't see any specifics on markings. tried to get pic but was hindered by my inexperience. he was headed north/northwest.(glad he was on the run and not hunting - my little harbor seal friend was still out here today. (<i>This was probably the minke whale reported Oct 10.</i>)

When we met up with the kids, their behavior seemed to be a bit strange. There was lots of playing going on, but they weren't going anywhere - they were staying in the same little spot. As we looked closer, we noticed they were very excitedly playing with a dead harbor porpoise!! They were breaching around it, spyhopping next to it, slapping it with their flukes, and carrying it on their heads. It was almost as if K14 "Lea" had told the kids - "Okay, big brother and I are going fishing. You two stay here and play with this porpoise..." We watched this for over 45 minutes and it was still going on when we left. We enjoyed a visit from <b>L88 "Wavewalker"</b> on the way home.

Passengers on the <b>7:55 am</b> ferry sailing from <b>Vashon to Fauntleroy</b> were excited to see many <b>Orcas</b>, I assume one of the resident pods, moving in the center of the Sound. We could see multiple splashes and whales surfacing in several places at once.
The vessel came to nearly a dead stop, the Orcas moved off to the east, we started again only to come to a stop a few minutes later, once again quite close. I'm not good at estimating distances, or observing orca behavior, but we could see the difference in dorsal fin sizes well and one big guy was distinctive, close, and easy to track from place to place. They seemed to be heading south.
Many passengers came out on the deck -- one person said "in 30 years commuting on this ferry, this is the closest they have ever been." It was the best look I have ever had at the orcas, a great start to the day.

They were too far away to see saddle patches but I'm pretty sure L87 Onyx was among them, and a little later Ruffles came past--the light was perfect for picking out the ripples in his dorsal. Looks like they were foraging along the way. Ruffles spent about ten minutes in one spot, making lots of u-turns and rolling on the surface, before continuing on toward Vashon.
