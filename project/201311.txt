 Skippering for James Mead Maya today included <b>humpback</b>, who appeared to be lolligagging<b> off Snug Harbor, and Southern Residents </b>breaching as they cleared<b> Cattle Point light</b>. - David Howitt

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
  
 Family of orcas off south side of Stuart Island midday Saturday. Five or six, including at least one baby. Headed toward Spieden Channel. - Tad Sooter

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>3:07 - Off Cattle Point now</b>. Just left them.
<br/>I go up and ask Carl what he has <b>off Friday Harbor</b>, I'm going there" A little while later we get there and up pop 3 Orca. I'm happy. Then suddenly there are 5 more behind them. Then suddenly there are 4 more and then several on the other side of the boat including one that breaches right next to us. Now I know,<b> it's Residents</b>. Then suddenly they are everywhere. - James Gresham 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We finished off November with another great day on the water.  I received a report of killer whales off of Friday Harbor mid day. Thanks Hobbes! They turned out to be <b>members of J, K, and L pod heading south down San Juan Channel.</b>  We watched them exit Middle Channel with a frenzy of breaching and cartwheels before they <b>fanned out in Haro Strait on a southerly line for Admiralty Inlet</b>. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales 

<br/><br/>

<br/>
<b>T123A east bound in the Juan de Fuca Strait</b>. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Humpback spotted in <b>Saanich Inlet at 1:30pm</b>. - Karen Gray	

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 28</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>SUPER POD swam by and gave the west side of San Juan Island</b> a Thanksgiving treat. <b>Members from all 3 pods were present, but not all of L Pod was there</b>. They headed north <b>past Kellett bluff around 2-3pm</b>.  Hope they come back down tomorrow when it's daylight! - John Boyd

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just an awesome day on the water with <b>all of J Pod, K Pod and over half of L Pod</b>. On the way in I picked up <b>a Humpback in Saanich Inlet</b> who breached twice while I was just getting on scene unfortunately my camera wasn't out... But after the breach it cartwheeled and was tail lobbing. This Humpback has been in the inlet for over 2 weeks now! - Simon Pidcock 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

 Still feeling the high of a superpod - nothing like a whale fix to lift the spirits! Here's <b>K20 Spock and K44 Ripple.</b> I wasn't expecting Granny for Thanksgiving! J2 off Lime Kiln Point State Park. - Monika Wieland  

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 27</font></b></center>
<br/>

Observed <b>3 Orcas circling the bouy on the N side of Mendocino Bay in Northern California</b> at about 39.19N Lat They were trying to dislodge sealions by making splashes around the bouy and frequent blowing After about 15 minutes (first observation around noon) they swam south and saw three distinct blows, one from a smaller whale I was about a block away when I saw the show. I spent 25 years as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have seen many orcas before, but this was the first sighting I made in 13 years here on the Cal Coast. - Alan Stein 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>About noon I observed three killer whales swimming around the bouy at the NW corner of Mendocino Bay</b>. 39.19 N They were hunting for sea lions They made a lot of splashes and spouted regularly. After about 20 minutes they swam south (toward Pt Arena). - Alan Stein

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Thanks to reports on Orca Network's fb page, I watched <b>8-10 orca</b> (presumed to be Transients) travel <b>from the north end of Marrowstone Island to north of Point Wilson</b>.... pretty much out of sight by<b> 3:40pm</b>. Was unable to post on fb from Fort Casey. They were too far away for ID's. Lots of Steller sea lions "people watching" at Fort Casey. - Jill Hein 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Elsa Leavitt reported <b>a bunch of orcas heading out Admiralty Inlet, off Bush Pt at 1:45 pm</b>. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:32 - Orcas off Windmill Heights</b> (about 2 miles south of Bush Point), mid channel, heading towards Bush Point.  - Mike Meyer 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 26</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>11:30 pm - </b>We were just outside with our dogs and could hear <b>a pod of orca out in the Sound</b> - too dark to see them, unfortunately! We're about <b>a mile north of the Kingston ferry</b> and it sounded like they were headed south. It sounded like a lot of them - lots of blowing, but no splashing. It was a pretty calm night or else we might not have heard them. It was pretty cool! - Shirley Bomgaars

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:40 am - Chamber's Bay gold course</b> (south of Tacoma, 4 miles south of Narrows bridge). Small pod of <b>4 or 5 orcas</b> were deep but we watched for an hour move from one location to another. A small one breached with fins showing but, the rest were deep. They were traveling. One came up and was playing a little bit but, looked like another brought it back down. They were deep. <b>Headed north to Narrows bridge</b> I presume. - Rebecca Harden

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Matt McCulloch from Tyee Charter called at <b>3:30 to report seeing about ten orcas off the south end of Whidbey Island </b>while fishing on <b>Possession Bar at 10:30</b> this morning. There was at least one adult male, 8 females and a juvenile who breached 4 or 5 times. Some of his passengers took photos which he will send whenever he gets them. There were no other reports of orcas anywhere today, but it was foggy so it's not surprising that these were not seen from land. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>Noon - off the Mendocino CA headlands, a pod of 10 to 12</b> were in my sight for about 15 minutes. - Michael Wilkerson 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">November 25</font></b></center>
<br/>

Today was my number 1 day with <b>Humpbacks</b>. TOTALLY MUGGED FOR AN HOUR UNDER AND ALONGSIDE THE BOAT. The following are Melisa Pinnow's words..."As we were watching a humpback, it went on a very long dive. While it was under, I said "watch this, its gonna be just like Baja." I was right. The humpback suddenly surfaced within feet of the boat and played with us for an hour, staying just feet underneath the boat, spy hopping on both sides and even fluke waving its gigantic tail just feet away...."  Back to Capt. Jim...In all my years this is the most amazing amazing experience I've ever had with a Humpback. I would swear it was listening to us. She was curious about the boat. As another boat approached she went to visit them for a few minutes then came back to us. There are times when whales connect with humans in boats. I know this to be a fact! This was one of those times. Epic moments!  - Capt. Jim Maya 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Never thought I would have an encounter like this with <b>a humpback whale in Haro Strait, near San Juan Island</b>, Washington. On Maya's Westside Charters it was an unbelievable experience on a mid-November, 2013 afternoon. - Jeanne Hyde 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

 What a great Sunday! <b>Two Humpback Whales waving goodbye as they swim out of San Juan Channel</b> today at about <b>11:20AM</b>. - Chris Teren

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:30 - In Lincoln City OR watching three Transient Orcas</b>, 100 yards offshore, heading southbound. Right now! We couldn't get any ID's but assumed they were transients. We tried to catch up with them to get ID's but had no luck. It was interesting. The Orcas were traveling the exact same distance offshore as 90% of the sea lions we had sighted. We believe they were three females. - Spencer Domico 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:00 AM - Three possibly 4 Orcas sighted off Lincoln City, Oregon</b> beach heading South. First spotted around 10 a.m. off beach access NW 15th and last seen in Lincoln City after 11 a.m. near Siletz Bay. There was a male in the group. Was not able to get any pictures. This is a confirmed sighting from the Oregon Marine Mammal Stranding Network. - Jane Holbrook

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:50 - </b>David Moffit of the US Forest Service called to relay a report of <b>three orcas off Cape Perpetua, OR</b>. 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Naked Whale Research reports<b> killer whales south of Point Arena, CA. 7:45AM at Schooners Gulch</b>. Heard loud blows... Knew exactly.., <b>pod of about 8-10 orca</b>, spread out in pods of two, one of about 5. No males. Positive they were orca. Heading south. 	

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>No exact date</b> I am the head of an environmental NGO in Cape Verde, Africa.  Some friends of mine recently saw <b>some orcas just off Sal (west coast of Africa) </b>where we live and this is the first time this has been reported to us.  We are reaching out to anyone who may be interested in this information and who may have details of any previous sightings.  - Jacquie Cozens Please report any sightings to Orca Network.	

<br/><br/>

This group of <b>Transient Orcas were south of Discovery Island. (T35, 38, 38b, c and d, 75b, and c)</b>, the same ones from two days earlier. - Capt. Jim Maya, 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We had them come up next to the boat south of <b>Discovery Island</b>, one taking a peek while another put its fluke across her back (see above) - that was rare and fun! - Florian Graner

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Mark set out west towards<b> Race Rocks</b>. The group was soon greeted by <b>three humpbacks </b>that displayed many tail slaps and dives, then <b>five transients </b>breached and spy hopped. Prince of Whales Whale Watching 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:15 - </b>We were at <b>Deadmans Bay (near Lime Kiln Park) </b>and saw blows way offshore. Next thing you know,<b> TWO HUMPBACKS came INTO the bay</b>--I kid you not and proceeded to travel ON THE SHORE along Lime Kiln. It was surreal. - Sandy Buckley 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

A<b> humpback cruises along the rocky shoreline of San Juan Island</b>. - Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
  
 Windy the humpback was off San Juan Island. - Jim Maya

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

I saw<b> 2 adult Humpback Whales today at 1100</b>, off San Juan Island, traveling through<b> Cattle Pass</b>. They traveled through Cattle Pass and then southwest into the Strait. Steady but unhurried pace. Periods of 3-5 blows, alternated with flukes up dives of up to 5 minutes. Pair remained within one body length of each other. - Breck Tyler  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Just got a call from Billy Wind reporting <b>2 dorsal fins in the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry lane</b> this morning, heading generally north at about<b> 8 am</b>. These are probably some of those Ts seen yesterday around the San Juans or the ones seen by Race Rock around 2 pm, if they turned around. Ts are known for erratic changes in directions. 

<br/><br/>

I was on <b>Magnolia bluff and saw a dorsal fin and 2 very scared seals</b>...I could see it in their eyes. Also saw sea lions... rolling around...I was on the beach there. I was there <b>1:30-3</b> and right in front of us, maybe 100yds out we saw a fin chasing 2 scared seals. But instead of diving (maybe was too shallow) it was just passing by at a good rate.  - Brandi Weill

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Around <b>3 - 3:15 pm</b> I was up there too and spotted some marine mammal activity south off the bluff. Saw dorsal fins but agree, didn't seem big enough for orcas or dark enough, more gray, but they were slightly obscured by a tree. And a bunch of seagulls landed too. And yea, looked like a mad dash by some seals. And also heard a couple whoof outbreaths. - Jill Irwin

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:17 - </b>Watching them now just above <b>Yeomalt</b>. Yeehaw! - Anne Duggan Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2 pm -</b> I watched some of it from <b>Sunset Hill Park above Shilshole</b>. What a show! Even from across the water with so-so binoculars, it was clear they were having a hunting frenzy. - Susan Vennerholm

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:42pm - </b>We have now moved down to <b>Manitou Beach</b>... they are trending south. Still very active mid channel. Looks like a baby baby in the pod!!!  - Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:13 - </b>still off <b>Manitou</b>. Foraging. <b>Bainbridge shore.</b>
<br/><b>1:30 - </b>they are slowly moving south. 
<br/><b>1:05 - Bainbridge Island</b>: Watching the whales, confirmed as Transients (solid saddle patches, killing seals!) - she counts <b>about 7</b> of them, including 2 juveniles and a young calf, less than 1/2 mile from the Bainbridge shoreline, <b>between Skiff Point and Rolling Bay</b>. They have been hunting there for the last hour, and now are moving slowing south again. They witnessed one or two kills, saw a seal flying through the air, blood and gulls. There are 20 lucky folks from Bainbridge getting a thrill today, watching this from a bluff above the whales! - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:05 - </b>Just spotted <b>about 5 orca 500 yards off Skiff Point, Bainbridge Island</b> (east central part of Island). No binoculars so couldn't get a very accurate count. One younger animal breaching a number of times. I worked with Ken Balcomb for several years, so a passing knowledge of J,K &amp; L pods, but unfortunately not close enough to ID anyone. - Sharon Nogg 

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Hi Orca lovers. It is<b> 12:40 pm</b>. A group of about a dozen of us (people) have been treated to an amazing show for over an hour. <b>A group of transient orcas have been foraging</b>, successfully off <b>Skiff Point/Rolling Bay</b>. And they are still here. Parking scarce. - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12 noon - </b>There have been about <b>a dozen orcas</b> breaching and otherwise surfacing for at least 20 minutes between <b>Bainbridge Island </b>(1 mile N of Skiff Pt.) and <b>the tip of Magnolia</b>. - Bill O'Neill

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:24 am - </b>now we've got some breaching and milling around happening. They might hang out here for a bit. 
<br/>Lynn Batson reported them off <b>N. Bainbridge: 11:14 am</b> - In rolling bay now! On the Bainbridge side moving south quickly. Lots of blows but not much else on the surface. Very tight group with a bunch of gulls hanging around.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:20 - </b>Can see them north of <b>Indianola pier</b>. Too far to get direction or #'s yet. - Susan Marie Andersson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Last sighting <b>approx 10:10, lunging then they bunched up heading south</b>. haven't resighted the pod as of 10:25 (but i moved). 
<br/><b>9:53 - </b>seeing <b>some fins Kitsap side</b>, still north of yellow mid channel buoy South of Kingston, north of Jefferson head. Swooping gulls must be lots of scraps. Trending southbound but of yet not seeing large numbers. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>Humpbacks	

<b>4 humpback whales between Race Rocks and East Sooke Park</b>. We were out on the water today looking for whales. We searched from Oak Bay Victoria BC to Sooke BC. A lot of life was out in Juan de Fuca Strait with numerous bait balls which fed over 6 species of marine bird. As we approached the bait ball we witnessed bits of fish and scales and deduced that the birds were feeding on sardine. We found a small group of harbour porpoise at Constance Bank, and four humpback whales off East Sooke Park (Lat 48 11.4 and Long 123 40.27). The humpback whales were doing repetitive 5 minute long dives and were very investigative of our vessel, as they did numerous circles with an average circumference of 9.0 m. The weather was clear and calm but temperatures were freezing and daylight was fading.  - Josh McInnes

We traveled <b>past Race Rocks, where we encountered not one, not two, but EIGHT humpback whales</b>, all within a kilometer of each other. They were traveling in groups of two and all stayed very close to the surface. After half an hour, the playing began. One group of two started splashing about and waving their pectoral fins at us. Shortly afterwards, we witnessed 2 full breaches in another group. That whale then began tail slapping loudly. Next, the most remarkable thing happened -- <b>these two groups of whales joined together</b>, and started traveling perfectly in unison, all surfacing at the same time.

A small <b>pod of Transient mammal-hunting Orcas</b> were sighted right outside Friday Harbor this afternoon traveling south in San Juan Channel. 
 One of the most well known transient Orcas in our area is<b> T20</b> (pictured above). He has a very distinctive nick at the top of his tall dorsal fin. T20 almost always travels with T21, who is likely a female relative. Some researchers believe they are siblings!

We left Snug Resort at 12:30 today, thinking we might find the Humpbacks that Simon Pidcock had reported over in the Sanich Inlet. We crossed a rough Haro Strait and headed toward Canada. As we got close to the zone, Jeanne saw the blows! But not huge HB blows. These blows were coming from <b>Orcas</b>! Unexpected Orcas! They were <b>T38A</b>, the one with the white patch on it's dorsal fin, <b>T35A and T35A1</b>. The forth Orca we're not sure about. These Orcas are usually seen in SE Alaska. And we did see Humpbacks as well. - Capt. Jim Maya

Amazing encounter with the <b>southern residents off Bush Point</b>, Whidbey Island, late this afternoon (thanks to Marilyn Armbruster posting on FB). We arrived just in time to see 7/8 whales grouped together close inshore, and watched as they interacted socially, played, foraged, changed direction from north to south and back again before drifting in leisurely fashion north in the twilight. The water was flat calm, like glass, as we listened to their powerful blows resounding across Admiralty Inlet, before driving to Lagoon Point to share final moments before darkness fell and the whales picked up the pace as they headed northwards to the open sea. - Sandy Pollard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

There were mid channel ones and some coming in close too, they came in<b> near the lighthouse around 4:30</b> ( 5-6 of them) and a few stragglers across at mid channel and near the Marrowstone side still at around 5ish. we saw many breaches too along with spy hops,tail lobbing, milling, circling back and forth. it was great......- Marilyn Armbruster

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

More <b>whales off Bush point</b>--way out toward the Kitsap side, but visible in binocs: 2 males scouting far in front, if you see them, to clumps of females following. about 8 in each fishing cluster (?) spy hops, tail lobbing, milling, and moving generally north.

On a recent Black ball <b>ferry crossing from Vancouver Island to Port Angeles</b> I noticed some activity off of our ferry. This was taken just as we exited Victoria harbor.

Whales off Whidbey again - members of <b>K pod</b> kept us on our toes going north up <b>Saratoga Passage</b> then turning south.

<b>8:20 am - </b>reports had members of<b> J &amp; K pods southbound in the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes</b>. With no whales in sight I head north as confirmed sighting started coming in from happy ferry boat passengers on the Mukilteo/Clinton runs. At Mukilteo I sight whales in Possession Sound heading northbound, traveling in small groups, &amp; spread out by a couple of miles.  Continuing w/the pods as far north as Baby Island, I could see whales spread out across the Passage and north to Greenbank &amp; Cama park.
<br/>11:15 - from Mukilteo I see a group in the middle of <b>Hat/Clinton/Camano Head</b>, milling.
<br/>11:20 - at least 6 more <b>northbound approaching Clinton</b>. Includes big male. woo hoo! Just saw another adult male just past Clinton ferry...they are streaming northbound mid to west of mid channel. More whoo hoos!
<br/>When the tail-enders rounded<b> Fox Spit</b> all foraging and other activities ceased, <b>Js &amp; Ks quickly turned and began porpoising south</b> gathering in larger and tighter groups. I watched until the last whales rounded Sandy Point into Saratoga Passage then boarded a ferry to Whidbey, luckily catching the tail end group from the shores of Langley. On the southbound journey, a stop atop<b> Bells Beach</b> invoked much awe upon hearing their blows, thunderous tail &amp; pec slaps, and seeing spyhops &amp; breaches. By <b>4:30 pm the pods had reached Langley</b>, one bunch numbering 15-20...passing human families, shopkeepers, townspeople, and visitors who had gathered on and above the shores. I asked some elated seeing-orcas-in-the-wild first timers to ring the Whale Bell, eliciting an eruption of cheers from shopkeepers, townspeople, and visitors. At the hands of Susan and Howie, the Whale Bell rang once more. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Was also on that ferry watching the <b>Orcas foraging, breaching while slowly heading North</b>. It was either a very large Pod, or multiple Pods...many of them spread out.
