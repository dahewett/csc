<b>4:40 - </b>I leave...the pod was more spread out they passed <b>Kingston</b> getting harder to see in waning light. Met many people along the way to share binos and orca/salmon discussions.

<b>11:00 AM - Group of humpbacks sighted just off Clover Point, Victoria, BC.</b> On Sunday morning, November 30, I saw a breaching humpback whale just about a kilometer off Clover Point, Victoria, BC (to the southwest). It was a sight to behold. The splash was like an explosion and I originally thought it was a speed boat that hit a wave too hard. Through my binoculars I could see more humpbacks coming up for air. They hung around for a few minutes and never saw them again. In total, I would guess there were 2-3 whales, but I can't be sure.

The orca that was found dead December 4 at Bates Beach near Comox, BC, was <b>Rhapsody J32</b>.... I saw her just a few days ago during my encounter with J and K pod on November 29th, 2014....here is a shot of her from that encounter (See Photo of the Day), she is the farthest right. Also pictured is the rest of her small family, her aunt J22, and her two cousins J34 and J38. This may very well be the last photo of Rhapsody while she was alive.
<br/>The Southern Resident orcas are now down to 77 members...

<b>9:56 AM -</b> Saturday morning of Thanksgiving weekend... very windy and cold, but the sight of <b>3 Orcas</b> traveling west between <b>Crane and Shaw Islands</b> (north of San Juan Island) drew us outside. A short time later, we sighted<b> 7 or 8 more</b>, again going west through Wasp Passage. We didn't see the first group soon enough to get a good photo, but a photo of the second group is attached. Based on the photo, there were 2 males in the second group.

<b>12:10 - 8 to 10 orcas in Case Inlet</b> (or Nisqually Reach), <b>between Johnson Point and Anderson Island </b>(13 miles SW of the Tacoma Narrows bridge), breaching and milling. Not traveling. Leslie Demich.
<br/>My wife, Leslie, called you on Saturday to report an <b>Orca sighting in Case Inlet</b>.  Per your instructions I tried for dorsal fin photos.  While it seems to me there is sufficient evidence here to confirm the creatures in question are Orcas, unfortunately they were too far from shore for my lens to get much detail.  I estimate they were about a half mile off shore, based on Case Inlet being about two miles wide from Johnson Point to Anderson Island.  They were paused in front of our house when Leslie first spotted them, then moved slowly southward with an accompanying flock of seagulls to help locate them.  They paused again perhaps a mile south of Puget Marina, a few circling back almost to our location once or twice, then left the area heading generally southeast toward Luhr's Beach.
-Gary and Leslie Demich

<b>3:53 - </b>Just left <b>Tolmie</b>. Spent over an hour there. The distortion is terrible, but <b>blows</b> were visible. There was a boat near them, but because of the distortion, that's all I can relay. It's just too cold to stand out there for long! Plus I had zero service.
-Jessica Pagan

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:35 - </b>Lost sight in the chop. However, they're headed toward <b>Nisqually Wildlife Reserve </b>past the <b>southern tip of Anderson Island</b>.

<b>12:30 - </b>From a friend of mine, Carolyn Logue - "ORCAS heading south in <b>Nisqually Reach toward Tolmie State Park</b>."

A truly memorable Thanksgiving day... Heeding the orca call (irresistible) of Southern Residents off Mukilteo, we headed for <b>Clinton arriving around noon </b>and were soon rewarded by the sight of dorsal fins and blows heading north <b>between Hat Island and Whidbey Island</b>. Suddenly the whales turned and milled before picking up the pace again towards the Clinton ferry dock. We watched <b>at least 12-15 orcas</b> pass by in two groups, thrilling waiting passengers at the ferry terminal and slowing down the ferry (perhaps the Tokitae). By 1:15 the whales were passing close to Glendale beach and having a good look around (lots of spy-hops) as they maintained a fast pace <b>towards Possession</b>. Four whales, including two mature males, turned and came close to shore as they circled prey with lots of tail slaps. We caught up with them again around<b> 2:50 pm</b> as they cleared the green marker at <b>Possession</b>, followed by numerous (too many to count) full breaches and spectacular splashing. Although we didn't witness a lot of foraging, hopefully this high profile behavior indicates that they were finding plenty of energy bars. With strong winds and sea conditions worsening, we left our post at 3:15 pm still seeing huge splashes mid-channel in Possession Triangle, with the whales possibly heading south.

Southern Resident Killer Whales Puget Sound-Nov 27, 2014 (HD) 
<br/>Southern Resident orcas (fish eating type) foray into Puget Sound foraging for salmon, socializing, bonding....engaging in their ancient cultural ways. Filmed from the shores of Edmonds &amp; Mukilteo as I wander along the route of their journey on this gorgeous blustery day. Please don't visit marine parks, these intelligent family bonded orcas belong in their natural habitats...the open seas. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

I'm happy to report that I sighted what appeared to be <b>Southern Residents at around 9:00 a.m.</b> today (about 10 minutes into the trip) on the <b>Edmonds to Kingston ferry</b>. Fortunately the Captain saw them and announced to the passengers that they were just off the port side. I was on the starboard side when it happened. When I got over to the port side it was hard to see through all the people gathered in front of the windows. The whales were spread-out not far from the ship, foraging near the surface in moderately choppy seas. I think there may have been at least 4 or 5 whales. -Davis Hyslop

I just spotted<b> two large orca</b>s in the bay that our house overlooks. Not sure of the exact type, but they were black with large white spots near their eyes, like the classic killer whale. Two seen together. Basically they were spotted coming from the north into the southern portion of <b>Carmel Bay, California</b>. Spotted them the second time directly north of the tip of the Point Lobos peninsula, they appeared to be heading west back out to sea, but I can't be certain of direction. Seen approximately 10:35am and <b>10:45am PST</b>. They weren't really doing much of anything, just gliding through the water and staying under for long durations. Not sure if there was a male, but they both seemed large. i.e. It probably wasn't a mom and calf unless it was nearly full grown. One of the whales had a very large portion of their upper fin torn off. Nearly half of it was gone. -Taylor Hartnett

Just got back to the house after an amazing encounter with resident orcas!! Went out looking for them with some friends and found them over <b>between Eastern Bank and Dungeness Spit.</b> They were very spread out and headed northwest when we left them around three: It was <b>J and K pod</b>, including the <b>K16's and K21, and L87</b>. Did not see the J17's or J11's (easily could have missed them) but did see <b>J38 and the J16's</b>. Lots of very energetic foraging/chasing and we saw <b>L87 and J49 </b>both with salmon in their mouth. Lots of breaches, spy hops, tail slaps, and general goofing off. <b>J2</b> was being followed by <b>J38, K38 and K44</b> who were being quite social with each other. Got a good shot of K44's new nicks. Happy to be home!! -Melisa Pinnow

They are spread out for a quarter mile, maybe more on the Port Townsend side, but far enough out we can see them. Two with tall fins, many... as they get to Protection Island for a background they spread out, hopping once or twice... the two big fins seem farther apart. Westerly or northwesterly, splitting into two pods or not, we could not tell. Thank you, thank you, thank you. -John Morelock

I headed out with the baby to check it out. Three times I almost turned around to go home, but something told me to go. They turned around 3 times to head down the Narrows. After a little game of back and forth the orcas finally decided to head up <b>Colvos Passage</b>. I tracked them all the way up the passage, and finally got to see them up close. I got some Id's but I think there were more that I missed in that moment. Still grateful for sharing the experience with the kids. Hope to see more whales soon. -Kelly Burns Keenan

From <b>10:45-11:30</b> we watched some very spread out <b>residents</b> head slowly south in Haro Strait offshore of <b>San Juan County Park</b>. Whales were foraging and doing long dives, but I saw for sure <b>J2, K21, L72 and L105, and L84</b>. After passing the west side at night several times, it was awesome to finally have the residents come by during daylight hours! With the whales so spread, however, it was confusing trying to figure out who was where and it sounds like the rest of J-Pod was MIA during that time, until being heard on the hydrophones overnight between the 17th and 18th. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Today was pretty amazing. I had been staying on Stuart Island for the past couple days and I knew the Southern Residents had gone north. Hoping for a return trip down past San Juan Island, we took a chance and went out at 8:30am. We scanned north and turned to<b> Turn Point</b> to look down and we came around the corner and<b> there they were</b>! I'm not sure if all <b>members from all 3 pods</b> were there as they were super spread and doing longer dives, but it was amazing. We were the only boat out for a long period of time. We followed along until <b>Kellet Bluff</b> where we got to see some good fishing action! The Center for Whale Research also was out today, so I'm hoping they could confirm everyone was there. Beautiful day on the water! - Traci Walter

Unidentified <b>orcas were seen heading north through Active Pass</b> this morning.

While visiting Ft. Ebey State Park on Whidbey Island today my partner and I observed <b>a group of Orca Whales</b> from the bluffs just <b>south of Pt. Partridge</b>. There were a minimum of 9, and possibly <b>as many as 20 Orcas</b> traveling north, spread out from 400 yards to 1 1/2 miles offshore. The time was between<b> 3:50 and 4:15 p.m</b>. The whales appeared to be traveling with purpose. There were at least 3 large males (very tall central fin) and numerous medium sized and a few smaller individuals. We were able to observe 9 individuals either surfaced or spouting at one time. Clearly, there were numerous others as they appeared shortly after at other locations amidst the pod. Lighting was perfect with low angle sun backlighting the spouts. There were a couple of groups of 2 or 3 traveling close together with the rest of the individuals spaced more widely apart. One large male was closest to shore and the audible sound of his spouting was what initially drew our attention. Several of the whales passed very closely by the vessels (within 2-300 yards) without appearing to alter their course. - Dave Schmalz

Whales everywhere, too many to count... Blows first seen <b>across Admiralty Inlet from Mutiny Sands</b>, Whidbey Island, at <b>10:30 am</b> on a crisp, bright morning turned into an unforgettable day on the water with the Southern Residents as they headed north out of Admiralty Inlet. Ken Balcomb, CWR was on scene as was Brad Hanson, NOAA, while we had our own expert, Howard Garrett, on board to photograph and ID foraging, porpoising, spy-hopping, breaching, tail-slapping, raspberry blowing (yes, really!) orcas in our midst. For the second day running we watched their blows disappear into the sunset, some turning west and others north, to meet up again who knows when, and where? - Sandra Pollard (Author of Puget Sound Whales for Sale)

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b> 2:00</b> - What a spectacular, cold but amazing day out on the water <b>off Bush Point </b>with <b>whales seemingly in every direction</b>. Although there were multiple breaches which I was lucky enough to see, I didn't capture any of them on camera -- but there was plenty of foraging, porpoising, spyhopping, tail lobs, fluke waving, and other wild activity! - Steve Smith

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

About 2:00 we saw spouting near <b>Marrowstone Island</b> - eastern side. We boated over and turned off the engine. Several orcas had already passed us by, but looking south there was pod after pod all headed north. I say pods - but I don't know. <b>groups of 5-10</b>. 2 jumped and turned belly upward. One group of 6 was diving and emerging all together over and over. Some seemed to swim by themselves. The sound of their breath all around was amazing. One came right at the boat and turned and passed us just a few feet from port side. We sat about 30 min, and when we left they were still coming in groups but now were more in the center of the channel. - Sally Gecas

Mexico Coastal orcas - Rare killer whale sighting <b>off Tijuana. 12 Orcas</b> sighted at US border with Mexico - very rare. About a dozen Orcas appeared November 11, 2014 at the beach in the small surfing town of <b>Playas</b>, right at the Mexican border with US, about 10 miles south of San Diego. This has "never happened before" - nobody ever saw an Orca here. There were <b>two groups of 4 to 7 Orcas each</b> which played separately about 50 yards/meters apart from each other, just outside the first surf break, within 100 yards from the beach itself. A surfer and some others reported that they "ate a dolphin" and described them holding it in their mouth and "throwing it about", which sounds typical behavior. I didn't see it, but the gulls and scavenger birds were swarming to feed on some leftovers of something, and there are or were plenty of dolphins here. The Orcas fed and played and trained their babies for about an hour then headed due west. This is out of your main geographic area of interest, but it was a fantastic show, and might mean some "change" in behavior. Air and water temp were both 69 degrees F, so 20.5 Centigrade, weather was overcast, tide about mid-tide, wave-face about 4 feet, with shallow sloping sandy beach. <b>A surfer in black wetsuit was in the water, and 3 large Orcas approached him in a semicircle to about 30 yards/meters and each in turn did a "spyhop" </b>maneuver, wherein they surface in a high vertical posture and hover high up for a few seconds - perhaps threatening? or perhaps just to look, or to announce their presence or claim territory, it was quite beautiful, and he got out quickly. Their colouring was less bright and high-contrast black&amp;white colorful than Shamu, more camouflaged, not so instantly recognizable, with dark top, pale creamy grey accents, and pale tan saddle, very pale belly, and the unique big tail-flukes of an Orca, which gave them away from a distance. They were up to 15-20 feet long (5-6.5 meters) and sleeker more streamlined than Shamu, and had tiny babies. They made a wonderful show. 12 (approx) in two groups - 1 group of 6 or 7, and 1 group of at least 4. At least two had the high proud triangle of the adult male dorsal fin. Feeding, playing, teaching babies. Babies were very small like 1/4 to 1/3 the size of their mommy that they swam alongside. Each group, or at least 4 in each group swam in very very tight/very close formation. - Alan Williams

Today at <b>~12:05 pm I saw a humpback </b>(?) in front of our house (we live in a neighborhood above Shenanigan's in<b> Tacoma</b>) slapping it's fluke on the surface. It stayed in the same place for ~5 min. displaying this behavior, then a small white boat approached from the west. The boat stopped to observe from a distance. The whale then left the surface of the water and headed west - towards Point Defiance. Then it started to rain so hard I completely lost sight of it (&amp; Puget Sound!) - Mollie Heilesen

I had to use the binoculars to identify it, but initially I saw some white like a spray and then grabbed the glasses to see it break the water. Initially heading NW and the next time SW from our home. - Rosemary Denson
