<b>June 26, 1958</b>
<br/><b>Orca pod siting off of Maury Island 1958 - 06/26/1958 02:00 PM</b> - by Marti Hilyard
<br/>I was going from a Campfire Girls camp on Maury Island to Fisherman's Warf when I was in 4th grade,I believe, so it must have been 1958. We were aboard he Virginia V ferry and I was up where the captain was at the top of the ferry. He had Kleenex handy because I was not the first little girl that did not want camp to end.
<br/><br/>
I saw a whale, then another and more...the captain told me that most regulars on the sound called them Black Fish, but their real name was "orca". There soon were about forty orcas surrounding the ferry. To me it looked more like ninety, but the captain estimated the pod was about forty orcas. I can still see them surrounding the ferry and hear them blowing and breaching as clearly now as I did then. I can smell the salt and feel the sense of loss as they pulled away and rounded the island. I knew then that I would never forget that encounter and I never have.
<br/><br/>
As soon as I retired, I started preparing myself to be physically ready for our Canoe Journey. I am an elder in the Puyallup tribe and now a member of our canoe family. I did not meet any orcas on this year's journey, but being on the Salish Sea and paddling for between 5 to 7 hours a day renewed my spirit and body both. By the end of our journey, we had 94 canoes, many of them made our traditional way from great cedar trees, weighing up to 3,000 pounds. I am hoping that I will have a chance this coming year to sing to orcas and hear them sing to me again.
<br/><br/>
(<i>We asked Marti if we had her blessing to share this report</i>)
<br/>Yes, oral history is a gift to the eight generations and the most important responsibility given to Elders. You may use,quote and relay this information in any way that will help our orcas, contribute to understanding the severity of decline in not only orcas, but also the the loss of abundance of all the supporting species and their food sources as well.  There were many young witnesses on that ferry...I am sure many have moved away, or may not think about that unexpected encounter, but wouldn't it be fine if providence intervened and another member of my first canoe family of girl scouts happened to come across this information that would enable her to remember that day and add to the record.

Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - <b>T46 and her son T46D</b> (born 2000) in <b>Penn Cove</b>. "Looked like 4 and they were getting seals." -Jennifer Swenson Dohner (<i>ID's by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research</i>) 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Approx <b>3:00 p.m. - They were nearing Polnell Point</b> - long down times. I barely glimpsed them - not sure if they'll head around the point or turn south down Saratoga. -Jill Hein 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

They <b>left Penn Cove about 2:20 </b>or so, caught very distant look at them from Long Point around 2:45, then lost them...really far away. Too far for i.d.s 
<br/><b>2:05 p.m. - At least 3</b> including 1 male across from Coupeville Wharf on Oak Harbor side of Penn Cove. <b>A member of the T46s tail lobbing in Penn Cove.</b> Very active as if on/or celebrating a kill; breaches, cartwheels, gulls swooping. -Bonnie Gretz 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:10 p.m. -</b> Not completely sure but we think we just saw <b>a couple of Orca at the mouth of Penn Cove</b>. East of Monroe Landing and closer to that side too. We were across the way and, based on your description one was male. We lost sight of them but they appeared to be headed towards Coupeville or maybe the mussel rafts. -Maureen Denny 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">January 30</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>J26</b> spyhop. We left J<b>'s spread out moving west out the Juan de Fuca</b> this <b>afternoon</b>. They came south through <b>Oak Bay</b> single file in the <b>morning</b>. At approximately <b>9:00</b> I received a call from George Hamilton who had a large group of whales moving past his house just north of Ten Mile Point. I told him to send me some pictures to confirm whether they were SRKW's or T's. I suspected <b>J's/L87 </b>from the description. Sure enough they were. I watched them from the apartment come around <b>10 mile Point</b> and proceed single file through Oak Bay. On the way to town I drove along the waterfront to watch them from shore. They went past the golf course and then swung south of Trial. I watched them porpoising for a short while on a line for Constance Bank before I left to get the boat. At 1045 I came across the first whale L87 who appeared to be the furthest north of the group close to the Victor Hotel buoy. The whales were very spread out and doing fairly long dives. They continued past William Head and I assumed they would go through Race Passage but <b>they swung east and south of Race Rocks</b> and continued west. I left them at <b>1245 slightly west of Race Rocks</b>. 
<br/>(<i>See full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 11</i>). -Mark Malleson

Humpback whales
<br/>At <b>1:06 p.m.</b> Sofie Fatale reports seeing <b>a humpback </b>(presumably the over-wintering juvenile humpback) off the north side of <b>Point Defiance in Dalco Passage</b>. 

<br/><br/>
<center><b><font color="navy">January 29</font></b></center>
<br/>
<b>10:44 a.m. - Puget Sound </b>- They are still hanging out here by the ferry. About a mile off <b>Clinton ferry dock</b>...Looks to be <b>at least 2-3</b> one is an adult and heading towards Everett, mid channel... I was coming fromMukilteo and about a 3/4-1 mile from Clinton and they were to the north of us heading towards Everett/hat island area but I looked for them when I got to Clinton and couldn't see them anymore 
<br/><b>8:19 a.m. - Orcas this morning in the middle of the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry rou</b>te. I think going south towards Edmonds. I work on the ferry and will keep a lookout. -Melissa Simmons 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:14 a.m. - </b>Just saw <b>a few orcas near Clinton ferry terminal</b>. Heading south. Maybe two, male and female. We were on the ferry about 1/4 mile or less from the terminal. The boat stopped before landing and we all wondered why, when my friend noticed something in the water and I saw the big male dorsal fin. We just happened to be sitting on the right side of the ferry! -Jill Irwin 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2 Orcas spotted in Howe sound</b> today! i didn't get the privilege of seeing them but my neighbor said one of their dorsal fins was the biggest he's ever seen (4 ft at least) - at <b>9:15 am</b> they were almost at horseshoe bay (going south on east side). -Lori Payne 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Juvenile humpback travelling northbound into Colvos Passage</b> about a quarter mile off Gig Harbor shore at <b>1030am</b>. -Michele Riley Campbell 

<br/><br/>

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
  
Unidentified killer whales - <b>830 am </b>- killer whales in <b>Active Pass heading towards Georgia Strait</b>. About 10 whales with one male that I saw and one calf. Only pictures are on my cellphone not the best ID pics. (<i>Possibly J pod who was heard on Lime Kiln around 12:30 a.m.- ALB</i>). -Brook Speed  

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
  
I came across the <b>T085's on the afternoon</b> of January 28th <b>offshore of Sooke Basin heading back out the Juan de Fuca Strait</b>.   Perhaps their winter visit to the area is done for now. Hopefully they will become regular visitors to the area. (<i>See Mark's full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 10</i>) -Mark Malleson 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:00 pm - 4 orcas (2 adults, 2 juveniles) in Saratoga Passage</b>. Feeding, playing. They were within 200 feet of the shoreline, about the midpoint between Fox Spit and Baby Island. They were heading toward Baby Island although we couldn't see beyond our trees so could have gone toward Coupeville. We got some video if you want; we'll try to send it. -Mary Laissue 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

This morning about <b>9:30 am</b> we were treated to a fabulous energetic display of<b> about 6 females (juvenile included) 1 male while on Possession Sound between Gedney Is and Everett</b> likely fishing?? Our private passenger ferry was able to stop on route going West to enjoy the activity, close up of female breaching do you know which resident group this??? Most passengers saw Orcas in the wild first time ever! Amazing. UPDATE: Sorry we docked and lost sight as they seemed stationary don't think they went south or west of Gedney (Hat). -Charlene &amp; Chuck 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
  
<b>4:58 p.m. - </b>Visible from the Narrows viewpoint of <b>5 Mile Drive at Point Defiance</b>. -Anglea Batie Carlin

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>2:05 p.m. -</b> Island Explorer 4 just found him/her. Apparently he's been hanging out with a freighter for most of the day. Still down by Pt. Defiance. -Erin Johns Gless 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Maia from WSF relayed a report of <b>a humpback 1/4 mile off Pt. Defiance at 1:18 pm</b>.

<br/><b>15:00 * 5-10 Orca moving quickly, heading south-west between Whytecliff Park and Passage Island, Queen Charlotte Channel</b>. Was sitting on a bench at Whytecliff park in West Vancouver,looking out at Passage Island when all of a sudden a big male dorsal fin appears. There were two males and five-seven females. One of the big males was by itsself and came up for air really close to the Whytecliff Park Islet. Some of them swam around Bird Islet and they were all heading towards Passage Island. Lost sight of them as they went around Passage Island. Not sure if they were Transients or the Southern Residents. Observed from Shore. -Jarod Adams, West Vancouver, BC

<br/><br/>

<br/>
  
<b>- Strait of Juan de Fuca</b> Went out today in search of wildlife around <b>Sooke</b> waters...It was a great encounter with the <b>J16's, including J42 and others</b> of our endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales (heading eastbound) and a male Elephant Seal around Race Rocks Lighthouse! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>  

"...As the sun came out and made spotting easier we continued back <b>south of Race Rocks</b>. Mark spotted a blow and a dorsal fin which turned out to be <b>J16</b>. She was travelling with <b>J42 &amp; J50</b>. They were foraging and hard to track..."  (<i>See full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 8</i>). -Mark and Hannah Malleson 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:20 pm - </b>call from Connie Barrett, Camano Island, husband saw <b>5 killer whales in Saratoga Passage heading north</b>. Two were near the Whidbey side (Greenbank area) and 3 were off Cama State Park, Camano Island. 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
The <b>T085's celebrating after a seal kill in Haro Strait near Kelp Reef</b>. "... Dave arrived, aboard "Orcinus", to the scene of the T85s just starting their seal kill as described above by Mark and Hanna at about 1420. T85C was the breacher and he appears to be another male. After Mark and Hanna left at <b>1455</b>, the T85s traveled slowly north in a tight group past the east entrance<b> to Hughes Passage</b>. They spread out briefly before coming back together.  At about <b>1530</b>, the whales milled some and gulls began diving on the spot again. The whales had probably been carrying a part of a seal as it did not look like another kill.  T85C and T85D dropped back and appeared to feed on a dropped piece of seal while<b> T85, T85A, and T85B</b> took a brief nap.  T85C and T85D soon caught back up and the group continued traveling north until they turned northwest into Minors Channel.  Dave left the T85s at 1601 still traveling northwest in Miners Channel between the northwest side of Sydney Island and Mandarte Island." (<i>See Mark Malleson and Dave Ellifrit's full encounter summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 9</i>) -Mark Malleson

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

S/he came from mid channel aiming towards us <b>at Point Defiance</b>. Here watching with volunteers Desiree Sauve and Bill Clogston and several other excited humans. 
<br/><b>1:35 p.m. -</b> I found the <b>humpback</b>...s/he is mid channel milling about <b>with a sea lion between Tacoma Narrows bridge and tip of Point Defiance</b>. Trending slowly southeast. As viewed from south side of Point Defiance. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Common dolphins -</b> I came across a group of about 5 dolphins today while cruising around Olympia from Steamboat Island to the South end of Anderson Island. I started filming as soon as I spotted them; next thing I knew they were playing in my wake!! -Trevor Lake

Around <b>230 pm saw 2-3 orcas east of Eglon and south of Possession</b>. Just milling around at a distance. One looked to be a male. Could not get a good pic as I was some distance away but maybe transients?? -Toby Black 

<b><br/><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
The <b>T085's were off Victoria on the morning</b> of January 26th. They headed west out Race Passage turned around and were last seen heading east east of Race Rocks. I hadn't seen them since January 22nd 2011 according to CWR records. -Mark Malleson

<br/>
 
Thanks to Rod King on 4Ever Wild for heads up for <b>a large group of east bound T's in the Juan de Fuca</b>. We saw a large group of females and juveniles with a new calf mid strait south of Bechey Head. The<b> T086A's were among the group and the T101's were several miles inshore on the Canadian side</b>. I sent a picture to Dave Ellifrit and he suspects that I had a shot of T071B. It looks like the <b>T071's were there</b> and I was able to confirm <b>T124D</b> as well.  She may have been the mother of the newish calf. -Mark Malleson

<b>Humpback whale</b>
<br/>S/He was there at the <b>Dalco Viewpoint off Point Defiance, Tacoma at 1:30 p.m.</b> today...It looked to be just milling about. It was quite close to shore, maybe just a couple hundred yards out. There was one boat shadowing it. I was there for about 30 minutes, and I saw it surface and blow 4 or 5 times. I've gone there many times to try to see one, and today was my first time. So exciting! -Gina Marie Gothe

Milling about, no particular direction...You can't see the tail markings here (just the boat right near him/her) but I was able to see the whale's tail fluke when he/she dove and it definitely had speckled markings. It was definitely a humpback. I couldn't gauge its size too well but it didn't appear especially small, despite reports of Speckles being little. -Lissa Brod Anderson

There were <b>quite a few orcas in front of Campbell River Sunday</b>. My husband saw them while out fishing and they were headed South. No idea which ones though. It was around <b>10am</b> Sunday. No pictures unfortunately as my husband is not nearly as interested as I am in them but between him and his friend they seemed to think there were between 40-60... which I imagine they were wrong about. Said there were <b>many groups of 5-7 </b>in different spots all over the channel <b>from Quadra to Mitllenatch island</b>. Some large males. All seemed to be heading south. Apparently some breeching and spy hoping activity too. My husband has spent a lot of time on the water in his life and said this was by far the most he had ever seen at once. That is pretty much all the details I have though... was hoping some of the local whale watching groups would have had more info but I haven't seen any. -Shari Lynne

At least three boats from Des Moines Yacht Club report seeing the <b>humpback whale</b> on Friday, 1/13. that has been in Puget Sound. They saw it off <b>Owens Beach (Pt Defiance).</b> It was floating in the water, not moving. They thought it was a log until it spouted at raised it's fluke. I asked around no photos. They were startled because they thought it was a log. One of our members was negotiating logs through the area and had the "log" off their port side with shore on the same side. He was in a 65 foot boat. Couldn't stop or veer away at that point. It was about 5 feet off his boat when he was startled to see the "log" blowing. We all assumed it was the same whale that was in the area last weekend. -Peggy Claar

<b>5:00 p.m. - Humpback sighted at point defiance</b>: Saw a humpback <b>two nights in a row around 5 pm from the bluffs at the Gig Harbor Overlook on the north side of Point Defiance in Tacoma</b>. Looked to be heading east on Thursday 1/12 and west on Friday 1/13. Breached right in front of me on 1/13. Both times lingered in the area maybe 10-15 minutes then moved on. It breached.  It was in an area where many harbor seals gather nightly at dusk and sea lions pass by. Perhaps there is food around? -Eve Pugsley

There was a male about three quarters of a mile or more to the west-southwest of this group and Dave headed out to him next. The male was J26 as expected and he was foraging as he moved slowly north. -Center for Whale Research Encounter 4

Dolphins/Porpoise
<br/> 
Watched a pod of<b> 8-10 dolphins or porpoises off Owen Beach</b> this morning, I think their body shapes might have been more like the <b>common dolphin</b>. They were leaping high out of the water and very active until a sea lion appeared, and then reversed course and swam underwater and vanished... From the pictures and descriptions, <b>my guess is Pacific white-sided dolphins</b>.  They were very black, and I think the dorsals were curved.  I may have overestimated the numbers, as they were in and out of the water very  rapidly.  They definitely came completely out of the water, however.  There was the agitated sea lion also there, and possibly the sea lion was chasing them???  Definitely too small for orcas...I also watched as the sea lion bark aggressively at a man standing on the beach. The sea lion had been swimming rapidly back and forth parallel to the beach after the dolphin/porpoise pod left. -Linda Cohen

Rare Orcas: <b>An eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) killer whale female and her calf travel from Long Beach to Newport Beach, CA</b> on Sat, 7 Jan 2016. An amazing first encounter with these mysterious whales from southern waters. The very small number of confirmed predation events involving killer whales from the ETP have included sea lions, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, blue whale, fin whale, Bryde's whale, and humpback whale. However, this does not mean that those individuals involved eat only marine mammals; some could be specialists in a particular prey type, others could be generalists. It is impossible to make a sweeping statement about all of the killer whales across the Eastern North Pacific - without observational data and biopsies which would enable fatty acid analysis and genetics analysis (determining haplotypes). -Alisa Schulman-Janiger, researcher, CA killer whale Research Project
