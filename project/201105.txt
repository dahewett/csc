<b>May 31, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Sean Minor called Orca Network with two reports. On May 31 he saw <b>3 orcas</b> about 2 miles south of the jetty at<b> Newport OR</b>, including one male.
<br/>*<br/>
The <b>Transients </b>showed up again at the north end of <b>Haro Strait</b>. They were traveling south when we were with them at 2pm. We had <b>T87 </b>with his distinct notch out of the trailing edge of his dorsal fin and a sweet little baby <b>T090C</b>.
<br/>Marie 'Orca-Magic', Prince of Whales, Victoria B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
Following up on a sighting of 1 whale in Active Pass, we located <b>5 transient orcas</b> southbound in <b>Swanson Channel</b> at approximately <b>1230 </b>. The group was ID'ed as <b>T87, T124A1, and the 3 T90's</b>. The group was traveling slowly, against the inbound tide, and were possibly resting. We left them at 1330, still traveling generally south.
<br/>Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch   
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:45 pm</b> - A radio call from the ferry, Powell River Queen, to Aaron of <b>Campbell River </b>Whale Watching gave a heads up of a <b>Humpback </b>Whale mid-channel between April Point and Painter's Lodge. The whale was headed Northward. 
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC
<br/>*<br/>
I had <b>2 harbour porpoise</b> by Elk Bay at 415 pm. Other than that just the <b>Lags </b>(short for Lagenhorynchus obliquidens the Latin name for Pacific White Sided Dolphins - SM). And 150 sea lions at Mitlenatch and a few were Californians. Cheers. Garry (Aaron counted around a dozen California Sea Lions - when you have that many, it's a bunch - SM)   
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC
<br/>*<br/>
2:45 pm: During one of my scans I spotted <b>5 or 6 Dalls Porpoises</b> looking like they were foraging just off Westview, Powell River heading towards the mill area. About an hour or two later saw what I believe were the same Dalls off the N. end of Texada slowly heading into Georgia Strait.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins BC
<br/>*<br/>
<b>2:15 pm</b>: Call came in from Garry, Aboriginal Journeys about Approx. <b>20 or so Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> at the N. end of Mitlenatch Island. They were slowly zig zagging in a foraging / feeding pattern.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins BC 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11 am</b>: First overheard on the radio from unknown sources that there were very playful <b>Dalls Porpoises</b> just by Hole in the Wall. A little later, heard Fog Horn Jeff, Painter's Lodge saying that there was a large group of Dalls that were there and putting on a lovely show.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins BC
<br/>*<br/>
I was out of state until last evening, but received the below message regarding Orcas off of Salishan Spit at <b>Siletz Bay, Oregon</b>. Michael Mefford is a great observer so you can trust his observations. He lives on the spit. Roy W. Lowe, Project Leader, Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex
<br/><b>18:30-21:00: 15 Orcas</b>.
I located the focus: orcas. A mix of a at least one adult male, females, immatures, and pez-dispenser size youngsters. They appeared to have seals so rounded. Observed frenzy and seal tail, but no red. They drifted northeast towards me until they were right off shore just beyond the first wave. Any closer and they would have beached. Close enough to see the white over the eye and the black swirl into the white at the anus. Observed three seals in same field of view safely inside the first wave. Observed breaching to side and to back, arching out of water, and leaping. There seemed to be sub groups according to age and may have been a second pod that left when I originally estimated 30. Lot's of behavior that I did not understand. They filled the exact same field of view for an hour before drifting back SW towards where that pilot first picked them up. Two hour long front seat sunset show. 
<br/>Michael Mefford
<br/>*<br/>
Late report by text message from Jack, <b>Campbell River</b> Whale Watching that Aaron N. had <b>Orca </b>by Sonora Lodge around <b>8:25 pm</b>. No direction - No numbers.  
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of B.C., Powell River, BC
<br/>*<br/>
We saw <b>two minkes at Salmon Bank</b>. They were quite spread out and didn't seem to be heading in any particular direction.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist,  Victoria Clipper III  
<br/>*<br/>
Off in the distance, we spotted five vessels off <b>Saltspring Island</b>, Canada. They appeared to be observing some <b>transient killer whales</b>. As our boat--the Sea Lion--got closer, we were able to identify a large male orca with a hooked or oddly notched dorsal fin. He was later identified as <b>T87</b>. Other vessels identified his companions as "<b>the T90s</b>," which would be T90 and a calf from 2005, T90B. We did notice a calf with the group of five and thought that because of its small size it may be a calf younger than T90B. The pod continued to zigzag around the boats and, at times, under the boats appearing on the other side of us after four to five minute down times.
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/> 
We stumbled on <b>Transient orcas</b> today to the south of <b>Saltspring Island</b> and then followed them into the Saanich Inlet, just off of Piers Island. They were somewhat elusive and kept all the boats guessing.

<b>May 30, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered <b>T20 and T21</b> off <b>Discovery Island B.C</b>. The whales were traveling slowly and heading south west. The encounter ended a mile east of Discovery Island.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>Transient orcas T20 and T21</b> spotted at <b>Discovery Island</b> at about <b>1:30pm</b>. There were two groups of porpoises milling around within 300 yards of the two transients, but no interest in an afternoon snack was displayed.
<br/>Tasli Shaw
<br/>*<br/>
We found our whales right where they were supposed to be: still off <b>Discovery Island</b>. These <b>orcas </b>were in a pod of two and with the help of another whale watching vessel, they were identified at the transients <b>T20 and T21</b>. T20 is a large male and T21 is a fairly large female, both estimated to be in their forties and known to travel together. After twenty minutes of watching them zigzag with long down times, we got word of another species of whale in the area: a gray whale. 
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5:30 pm</b>: The <b>5 Transient Orca</b> had just made a Dalls Porpoise kill by Frederick Arm, by <b>Raza Island, B.C</b>.  
<br/>Aaron, Eagle Master, out of Sonora Lodge
<br/>*<br/>
<b>11:15 am: 5 Orca</b> spotted by Subtle Islands near Whaletown, Cortez Island heading North towards Channel Islands - back and forth changing directions. First reported by Jeff, Fog Horn, running a tour out of Painter's Lodge. It wasn't long after that Garry, Aboriginal Journeys picked the Transients up heading towards Coulter Bay. Garry was with them for quite a while with his tour as they tail slapped, breached and took a seal or Sea Lion. The Orca slowly worked their way up to Raza Island and were still heading in a Northerly direction at 4 pm when Garry left them. See the rest of the evening report above.
<br/>submitted by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, <b>Powell River, B.C.</b>
<br/>*<br/>
On Maya's Westside Charters at <b>2:00 p.m.</b> we observed <b>T20 and T21</b> less than a mile off <b>Discovery Island</b>. T20 and T21 had been in the same area since being spotted at about noon. I learned late in the day that a few visitors to Lime Kiln Pt. State Park had seen two whales passing by Lime Kiln at about 10:00 a.m. That could not be confirmed, however, the locations and the time would make it possible that they may have seen T20 and T21. After leaving T20 and T21 we traveled toward Zero Rock to see a <b>gray whale</b> that another boat had come across. The gray whale was heading south toward Discovery Island.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Glassy calm, south <b>Haro Strait</b> at <b>1400-1500hours</b>, 1 mile SE of Seabird/Discovery Island, <b>Transient orcas T87 and T88</b> meandering at 4knots. He has a new scar line on his right side near top of fin where the cut out is ; still pink and ragged.  
<br/>Deb Martyn,naturalist for Orcas Eclipse Charter/Orcas Express
<br/>*<br/> 
About <b>6 PM</b> this evening, with the tide way in, a single <b>gray whale</b> was feeding close along the <b>Mabana </b>shore (SW Camano Island), heading south.
<br/>Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
After leaving T20 and T21 (see above report) we traveled toward Zero Rock to see a <b>gray whale</b> that another boat had come across.  The gray whale was heading south toward <b>Discovery Island</b>.  
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Just north of the Transients (Discovery Island) 5 miles (see above report), a small juvie <b>gray whale</b> coming south at 3 knots <b>1550 </b>hours/HaroStrait/ D'Arcy Island heading southward.
<br/>Deb Martyn,naturalist for Orcas Eclipse Charter/Orcas Express
<br/>*<br/> 
Five miles to the north (of <b>Discovery Island</b>), we saw a larger bushier blow (whale breath!) and eventually we saw the <b>gray whale</b> that belonged to that blow.
<br/>Serena, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>6 pm</b> received a call from Steve G., my eagle eye neighbour, that he spotted some <b>Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> between Texada and <b>Powell River</b>. There were between 20 to 30 of them performing some of their noteworthy leaps as they zig zagged in a foraging / feeding pattern slowly working their way North-West. Around 7:30 pm I lost them as they changed direction, yet again, and blended into the shadows close to Harwood Island shoreline. I picked them up again, as noted above, slowly heading into Georgia Strait between Rebecca Rock and Harwood Island. It's now 8:30 pm and can no longer spot them.
<br/>Steve G, submitted by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, B.C.  
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 pm</b>: A number of <b>Dalls Porpoises</b> were putting on quite a show at the top of Raza Island.
<br/>submitted by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, B.C.  
<br/>*<br/>
We were on the <b>Edmonds/Kingston ferry</b> around <b>5 p.m.</b> and saw a large group of what I am assuming were <b>Dalls Porpoises</b> to the North (or possibly Harbor porpoise? - see last report below). Could only see their dorsal fins (short and dark in color). Seemed to be moving fairly quickly and like I said, there seemed to be quite a few of them.  Yay!
<br/>Andrea Tellinghuisen 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>10 am</b>: Around 10 playful <b>Dalls Porpoises</b> were bow and wake riding with Jeff, Painter's Lodge by Chatham Point at the entrance to <b>Johnstone Strait</b>.
<br/>submitted by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, B.C.   
<br/>*<br/> 
We saw <b>Transient orcas T20 and T21</b> off Discovery Island on Monday. As noted by an earlier report, there were a lot of porpoises in the Ts' immediate vicinity, but they didn't show any interest the porpoises that we could see. They were moving at a much more leisurely pace than when we saw them in Swanson Channel on May 24.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist,  Victoria Clipper III, Seattle, WA
<br/><br/>
<b>May 29, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, Kira Kranzler encountered <b>L's</b> heading south in northern Swanson Channel at <b>5:35 p.m</b>. (48 43.710 N; 123 17.380 W). There were several groups fairly spread out and porpoising. We tried to keep up with them until we reached Henry Island, but they never slowed down. There appears to be a <b>new calf</b> traveling with <b>L55 </b>. This is a different calf from the one observed on Dec. 6th seen traveling with L5 (L117). We are tentatively calling the newest calf <b>L118 </b>and will confirm the number of new calves once we have had a more conclusive L pod encounter. The groups we encountered were the <b>L4s, L26s, L43s, L47s, and L53</b>. The encounter ended just off Henry Island at 6:56 p.m. (48 35.60 N; 123 12.23 W) with the whales still spread out and traveling fast south.
<br/>Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Out into the shipping lane known as <b>Haro Strait</b> off the northwest side of San Juan Island, we discovered about eleven animals identified as part of the resident group <b>L-pod</b>! These animals were traveling south at a quick clip and as we watched them, we glanced several fins with one belonging to a small calf. 
<br/>Serena, Naturalist , San Juan Safaris, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Watched the Greater <b>L37's</b> speed by the Center for Whale Research (<b>NW San Juan Island</b>) this <b>evening</b>. The water (rough) and lighting (backlit) reminded me of glory passbys of yesteryear but it was kind of weird to think that L92 is the big bull of that group. I saw L47, L82, and presumably their associated juveniles from the CWR. All but positive ID's on L53 and L83 but the water was pretty lumpy and the whales were backlit.
<br/>Adam U, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>~8:30 pm: L pod</b>, traveling very fast in at least 3 groups, very spread out mostly in the shipping lanes (off west <b>San Juan Island</b>). Water rough due to winds, swells 2'+ making it impossible to spot and count. They were "porpoising, " at times quite high to keep above the waves, giving us only quick glimpses.
<br/>Cindy Wesch, San Juan Island, WA 
<br/>*<br/> 
~<b>7:30 pm: Calls on OrcaSound hydrophone!
~8:30 pm: Loud and clear echolocation and calls on Lime Kil</b>n now.
<br/>Gayle Swigart, Olympia, WA
<br/>*<br/>
Capt. Jim Maya called to report being with a large number of <b>Ls </b>today, ~20. At <b>7:30 pm</b> they were off <b>San Juan county park </b>heading south toward Lime Kiln Pt. He said they porpoised fast all the way from Mouat Pt. to Open Bay, like they were rushing to meet someone, and being pretty frisky.  
<br/>*<br/>
Hearing <b>calls </b>now softly at <b>7:25 pm</b> Pacific at <b>Lime Kiln hydrophones</b>.
<br/>Suzy Roebling, Key Largo, FL
<br/>*<br/>
~<b>7:05 pm</b>: L pod approaching <b>Mitchell Bay</b> on the west side of San Juan Island, quite some distance from shore. 
Rough seas out there - hard to spot them.
<br/>Jane Cogan, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
<b>L27, L47, and L53</b> were the only ones I could ID for sure from <b>Lime Kiln</b>.  
<br/>Monika Wieland
<br/>*<br/>
It was the first sighting of <b>L Pod</b> since November, and they were on fire. Fifteen miles of porpoising and breeching. From <b>N. Pender Island to Open Bay</b>.
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
From Dave Ellifrit by way of Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, that Dave was with the <b>L25 subgroup</b> from the south end of <b>Swanson Channel to Kellett Bluff</b> late today as the whales raced down from the north. 
<br/>*<br/>
L Pod had been heard up at OrcaLab. As the day progressed, we heard very interesting reports of the whales going through Porlier Pass, and then down Trincomali Channel! Our wait was short as the whales decided to show an impressive burst of speed and were speed swimming for over an hour! They were making on average 7-9 knots, which is easily double what their normal traveling pace would be. But they weren't about to do the "normal" resident travel pattern. Captain's Passage became a cut through for the whales, and then just for fun they decided to cut between two small islands at the bottom of the Passage before entering Swanson Channel. And that's when the fireworks really began! Dozens of spyhops, breaches, single and double tail lobs, upside down swimming ...you name it, they probably did it! It was so exciting to see residents again, and they must have had full bellies to keep up such a blistering pace all while doing so much surface activity.
<br/>John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Explorer
<br/>*<br/> 
On Maya's Westside Charters at <b>1:30</b> we headed up to <b>Trincomali Channel</b> to meet the <b>L pod</b> whales who were heading our way. During this encounter I was able to get pictures of <b>L26, L90, L92, L53, L72, L105, L95, L47, L83, L90, L110, L115, L27, L55, L82, L103, L109, L86, L106, L112</b> and a couple additional babies. We returned for a late afternoon trip and found the whales to be porpoising their way down <b>Swanson Channel</b>, past Turn Pt. and on. They passed by <b>Lime Kiln lighthouse</b> at 7:40 pm spread across and continued on down/out direction.
<br/>Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/>
We spent a short time with <b>Lpod </b>in <b>Porlier Pass</b> between Galiano and Valdes Islands. There were at least a dozen in the group. The only one I could positively identify was <b>L92 </b>Crewser, but I'm pretty sure L82 Kasatka was among them as well. The light was behind them, so it was hard to see saddle patches even in passenger photos. They were traveling in a tight group when we first saw them, then spread out a little bit, and one of them spyhopped twice.
<br/>Stephanie Raymond, Naturalist, Victoria Clipper III
<br/>*<br/>
Following a report of <b>5 orca</b> on the east side of Valdez Island we were pleasantly surprised to locate approximately 15 members of <b>L po</b>d resting their way southeast. As they approached Porlier Pass, the group spread out and got very active, with numerous spyhops, some breaches, tail slaps and males swimming on their backs with their pectoral flippers in the air and flukes slapping on the water. The big surprise was observing this group swimming west-bound through Porlier pass against a flood tide. Many of the whales porpoised their way through the pass, which looked like running the rapids, and once in the calm waters of Trincomali Channel, they regrouped and appeared to resume resting. Positive ID's were made of <b>L26 Baba, L92 Crewser, L72 Racer, L105 Fluke, L95 Nigel, and L47 Marina</b> with a calf by her side!! We also observed a younger calf, but could not ID the female it was with.  There were more L's present, but these where the only ones I was able to confirm ID's for. Perfect day on the water! Happy to see some residents back in town.
<br/>Joan Lopez,Naturalist, Vancouver  Whale Watch
<br/>*<br/>
Saw <b>L pod</b> members this <b>afternoon </b>just off <b>Galiano island</b>. They headed through Trincomali Channel. L92/Crewser and his grandma L26/Baba were there with at least 6 others, including two calves (L112/Sooke?). They did a bout of spyhopping and and breaching before heading off at a quick pace (porpoising) south down Trincomali.
<br/>Tasli Shaw, Galiano Island, B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
<b>4:30 pm</b> overheard a report of Orca by Francisco Point, by <b>Campbell River</b> heading South. Both AJ and Jack found them shortly after the report. Jack identified<b> T20, T21 </b>pluse 3 others including a young calf for a total count of 5 Transient Orca. He left them crossing Whidbey Shoals headed North around 5:45 pm.
<br/>Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, B.C.
<br/>*<br/>
At <b>13:45</b> there was a single average sized<b> Grey whale</b> in <b>Saanich Inlet BC</b> traveling north. A more precise location would be about half way between Goldstream Park and Bushart Gardens. I observed about 8 surfacings.

<br/><br/>
<b>May 28, 2011</b>
<br/><br/>
A group of <b>5 transient orca</b> were located at approximately <b>noon </b>on the east side of <b>Galiano Island</b>, heading northwest. The group was later ID'ed as the <b>T124A group and T124C</b>. There appeared to be a calf that was approximately 1- 2 years of age. They were in a steady travel mode during our encounter, with some social interaction observed between the two youngest as they travelled.

<b>1:30 pm</b>: 12 Orca including 2 very new looking calves were slowly working their way South by Elk Bay just around Seymour Narrows. Although they were quiet, with open saddle patches they were identified as Southern Resident Orca possibly from <b>L Pod</b> - but who?  They stayed nicely grouped, with a lovely spy hop or two as they very slowly got down by Painters Lodge around 5 pm.

We wanted to let you know we had <b>L-pod</b> pass through here late last night! They went South in <b>Blackney Pass BC</b> around <b>0130 </b>and vocalized as they headed into Johnstone Strait. They vocalized for a few hours in Robson Bight before they headed east in <b>Johnstone Strait</b> around <b>0345</b>. Their vocals were very interesting to listen to! We sent a few clips to John Ford and he confirmed that it was L-pod. So they might be heading down your way!! (you can listen in to OrcaLab's hydrophones at Orca Live).
Then at <b>5:13 pm:</b> They were amazing to listen to this morning...what a wonderful way to wake-up!!! Sounds like they might be going past <b>Campbell River</b> right about now. Have a wonderful day!

Aboard the Mystic Sea we viewed <b>5 Transients</b> just Northwest of <b>Patos Island</b> in International waters, killing several Stellers. In a heavy tide rip they cartwheeled, tail-slapped and lunged over and over, to down two large Stellers. The action lasted over an hour and they were after yet another when we had to return to Anacortes. Powerfully exciting.

Awesome day along the <b>Galiano </b>shoreline today! <b>5 Transients</b> rolling and playing for the whole hour we were there. I wasn't able to ID them yet, I don't think I have seen that group before so if anyone knows who they are, let me know. The large female in the first picture has an interesting saddle patch for a T, seems to have a faint black stripe in it.

After an hour of solid travel, we edged up to <b>East point off Saturna Island BC</b>. And there they were: a pod of <b>transient orcas</b>! As we approached the area, we heard through the vessel radio grapevine that the pod may have made a recent Steller sea lion kill. When we got to the scene, the whales were zig-zagging and milling about; no obvious foraging activity was seen. While observing the pod, we noticed a very large adult male dorsal fin that had significant lean to the left and was very curved for a male. The other individuals in the pod appeared to be females and juveniles. Later, another vessel identified one of the orcas as <b>T18</b>. 
After ten minutes or so, the pod started traveling faster towards the south, moving more erratically and then thrashing about. The hunt was on! And it looked like another Steller sea lion was the target. We saw the pod of four orcas thrashing about, throwing their bloody red tasty morsel in the air. At one point, it looked like the sea lion had gotten away and it made some headway with about forty feet of distance from the whales. But then the transients caught up to their meal and continued thrashing and tossing it around.  Eventually, the male and a second orca split off from the other two, leaving the latter to contend with the sea lion.

<br/>*<br/>
We started to see vessels off the east side of <b>Saturna Island</b>. Not far from those vessels were five black dorsal fins belonging to <b>five transient orca</b> whales!  As we observed this pod, we noticed that all of the dorsal fins were crescent-moon shaped, each belonging either a female or a juvenile (male or female) and one of these dorsal fins belonged to a very small orca: a baby. Upon our first approach, we noticed several gulls circling overhead. Had the pod just taken a harbor seal or Steller sea lion with the gulls scavenging for scraps? We were still not certain. The transient group began heading south and then north and then random circles, moving rapidly at first and then slowly. The calf began acting up somewhat with fluke up dives, head stands and a semi-spy hop with its head clearing the water. As we ran out of time, the pod was still milling about and Bald Eagles were circling overhead. The pod was identified by another vessel as the <b>T100s</b>.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, and Kira Kranzler of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor at 3:30 p.m., with reports of transients heading north near Kelp Reef. We encountered the group of <b>five transients</b> traveling north at <b>3:44 pm</b>, about 1.5 miles north of <b>Kelp Reef</b> (48° 31.45 N; 123° 13.33 W). The whales consisted of <b>T26, T26A, T10, T10B and T10C</b>. We followed the whales for several hours while they slowly traveled north up Haro Strait. During most of their travel they were very spread out. At <b>6:55 p.m.</b> we ended our encounter and began our trip back to Snug Harbor, only to be called back to the scene a few minutes later because the transients were hunting a porpoise. We arrived back at the scene just as the hunt was concluded, with the whales appearing to have made a successful kill. We departed for a second time at <b>7:20 p.m.</b>, leaving the whales milling around their suspected kill, three quarters of a mile east of Morseby Island (48° 42.80 N; 123° 16.02 W).

We headed north with reports of Orca up near Pender Island. By the time we were on the water about 30 minutes the next report came in that the whales were moving steadily north towards <b>active pass</b>. We were committed to finding Orca for our passengers so we continued on. As we reached active pass we slowed and tucked on the side as the big BC ferry came through. While we waited for it to pass we were able to spot an eagle perched at the top of the highest tree. We came around the corner and entered the pass and were lucky enough to spot the whales. There were five transients cruising north. After a few good looks we recognized a calf in the mix along with the big male <b>T87</b>.

With some very scenic backdrops the <b>T10's </b>were doing what <b>Transients </b>do best, celebrating after a kill. Although we didn't see the hapless prey animal dispatched below the surface , we certainly saw the clean up gulls fly in as well as the behaviour of the Transients changed. They started to celebrate with tail lobs as they slowly traversed the shoreline of <b>Chatham and Discovery Islands</b>. We had first encountered the four T's at Oak Bay Flats around 1pm.

During our May survey of OR/WA waters for juvenile salmon, I observed a pod of<b> 6-10 killer whales</b> near our trawling station 19 miles off the <b>Queets River, WA</b> (QR19). The location was N 47.532, W -124.806. There were definitely two adult males with very tall dorsals, a few large females/subadults and some smaller animals.

As we left the dock, we had a report of <b>5-6 orcas</b> up near <b>Gabriola Island BC</b>. We got another 2nd hand report of whales "somewhere between Active Pass and Pt. Roberts." Still a lot of area, but smaller than before. So we headed towards <b>Eastpoint </b>to view the Steller Sea Lions, and had just made the corner when we stumbled upon <b>T18 and T19, T19B, and T19C</b>. As they passed offshore of Boiling Reef, <b>T19B </b>went into overdrive and started rooster-tailing a huge spray off his dorsal fin. Hunting!!!! 5-6 high speed zig zags and it was over, and the group had a nice little snack on a small harbor porpoise. After lunch, the whales seemed to be a bit more sedate and continued around the point and headed for Skipjack. We heard on the VHF that a large group of approximately <b>20 Transients</b> (I think the T100s and T102s were a part of that group) were quite aways behind us heading for Alden Bank. AND another group were up near the Bellchain Islands. At last count, this meant we had about <b>28 Transients</b> in the Strait of Georgia!

On Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon we headed up <b>Boundary Pass toward East Pt</b>. where transients had been spotted. The 1st group we encountered were <b>4 whales</b>, which included <b>T19B</b> (I could see three other whales with him &amp; am assuming his constant companions T18, T19 and T19C, but I didn't get pictures of them for proof of presence.) We left them and headed toward Alden Bank. Just north of Sucia Island we encountered a 2nd group: <b>T124C, T124A, T124A2, T124A3 and T124A4</b>. We continued on and encountered a 3rd group:<b> T100, T100B, T100B1, T100C, T100E, T101, T101A, T101B, T102, T124, T124D, T124E, T124A1, T36, T36B,and T36B1</b>. They changed direction and the 2nd group and the 3rd group joined up heading back in the direction of Pt. Roberts.

It was looking as though we had encountered a pod of <b>Transient Orcas</b>. They were heading south so we turned around and headed south as well. They were moving in a fairly straight line when suddenly they stopped, turned and started rolling and diving. It looked as though a hunt had begun. We couldn't see much from the surface but a minute later the gulls moved in and swept the surface in search of scraps.

The <b>Minke </b>we saw at Hein Bank were very, very special. They are a <b>Cow and calf</b> (small enough to still appear to be dependent) on its mom. I understand the Adult has been a regular at Hein Bank formally called "Johnny Rotten. BUT She has been re-named Christy Hynde-Bank and her calf. First photographed on May 20th by Prince of Whales and renamed by Jon Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Whale Project. I'm sure we will be able to view this pair all season. They are hard to spot. The female is shy with the calf and has erratic feeding patterns. She is all over the place every time she dives. She dives long and deep and she blows light, hard to spot.  The (blow) is almost invisible in a gray sea.

Following up a rumour of orcas near <b>Active Pass</b>, we located <b>T20 and T21</b> in the pass, near Miners Bay. The pair were traveling west through the pass, and then south in Swanson Channel. They were traveling slowly, with only about 3 breaths per surfacing, possibly resting. They passed by numerous harbour seals near Helen Point, and even one Steller sea lion without making any attempts at foraging. We left the T's southbound in Swanson Channel at the bottom of Mayne Island.

We stayed with them until we were almost across from Smuggler Cove, just above Secret Cove - a long way down from Powell River, and even longer for Jen from Campbell River Whale Watching who arrived on scene with a tour around 2:30 pm.

We met up with <b>7 northbound transient orcas</b> in <b>Trincomali Channel</b>, at the south end of Wallace Island. Every orca encounter is magical, but the beautiful natural setting made this one even more memorable. Positive ID's were determined for <b>T101, T101A, T102, T23, T23C and T23D</b>. A very spunky calf that appeared to be about 1 year of age was swimming mostly with T23C, however, was also seen with T23 and with T102. The calf was showing off it's breaching, spyhopping and rolling skills. We even saw some spyhops from T102 or T101A - can't tell them apart from their headshots. As the group approached Porlier Pass, they hunted and ate at least two seals that they trapped along the steep walls of <b>Galiano Island</b>. The entire group then moved through Porlier Pass into Georgia Strait, and were last seen northbound along Valdez Island at approximately <b>1:45 pm</b>.

A group of <b>4 Transients</b> that were just moving past<b> Eagle Point, San Juan Island</b>! No one knew they were there. Soon though they were heading out southwest towards the ODAS buoy. We were moving up the Canadian side of Haro and were almost to Gooch Island when Captain Ivan (aka Whale Whisperer) saw a large dorsal fin about 3 miles ahead of us. A glance about 1/2 mile towards <b>Moresby Island</b> and another small dorsal fin. Soon it was joined by another and another and another--another group of <b>Transients</b> and before long we were able to positively ID the whales as the <b>T10s </b>, along with 2 additional Transients (again, my ID powers on Transients is a bit limited so I'll send it to CWR or Jeanne Hyde for confirmation on the "extra" whales). But this group, unlike the earlier group, was in no hurry to go anywhere...and we soon discovered why. This group kept making slow, lazy direction changes, and as the sun glare cleared the water for a moment, we saw a Harbor Seal amidst the orcas. Soon however, he was dragged underwater and we didn't see him for the rest of the encounter, so we assumed lunch had been had.

This was in about 1,200' of water and it appeared the carcass may have been on the bottom as the whales <b>pulled pieces of blubber up from one particular spot the whole time</b>; part of the intestines were incised out and were floating. In the other attack we had over a week or so ago, the carcass was floating and the whales pulled it under to feed and then it would occasionally pop back up again but the guts were intact on this one.

They headed north out of<b> Puget Sound</b> on Friday (5/20) with a strong flooding tide, into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, spread out on long dives, seeming intent on hunting salmon. About 5 miles north of Port Townsend, we watched them from about <b>2 to 2:45pm</b>.

I would like to report a pod of <b>orcas </b>that was moving south this evening at about <b>7pm </b>along the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b>. They were rather far out in Haro Strait but I managed to take some pictures from West Side Road, about a mile south of Lime Kiln Point State Park. Maybe you can figure out who these guys were. It seems like the whales had fun, we saw some breaches and a little bit of spyhopping (this looks like J pod).

I saw <b>J pod</b> at <b>Cattle Point</b> on the west side of <b>San Juan Island</b> heading north, at around 6, confirmed Ids of Blackberry, Doublestuf, Polaris and Princess Angeline.
<br/>Melisa Pinnos
<br/>*<br/>
Departed at low tide and headed south through <b>Cattle Pass</b>. There was word of Minke's (see Minke report below) and J-pod out towards Port Townsend.  On the drive out we saw lots of Gulls feeding in bait, which is a good sign for whales.  <b>J-pod</b> was well spread out and seemed to be feeding. Gulls and Auklets swarmed the bait that was being pushed to the surface by the feeding orca.   After about 20 minutes or so of feeding the birds seemed to disappear and J-pod began to move in a more steady direction towards the west side of San Juan Island. On the trip home we used some passengers photos to positively ID Riptide out of the group. As we slowly approached the area where the Orca had last been spotted a <b>Minke whale</b> took a breath straight off our bow! It surprised everyone. While we were still catching our breaths from the Minke encounter the passengers began seeing smaller blows all around us.

The Victoria Clipper called Orca Network to report  <b>6 - 7 orcas</b> outbound in <b>Admiralty Inlet</b> at <b>12:52 pm</b>, 1.5 miles west of the Sierra Alpha buoy N. of Pt. Townsend. Then we received another call from Stephanie Raymond, Clipper naturalist, saying J21 &amp; "the cookies" were ID'd by the naturalist onboard.

At <b>11 am</b> I received a call from John and Joan T. that we had around <b>5 Orca</b> out in front of <b>Powell River, B.C</b>. 
<b>11:30 am:</b> Found the approximately <b>10 Transient</b> (meat eating) Orca between <b>Powell River and Harwood Island</b>. They were doing long dives, anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes, heading Northward in a somewhat zig zag pattern. Dropped the hydrophone, but there were no vocals. Suddenly it appeared that there were between 12 to 16 whales in a couple of groups between Harwood and just south of Atrevida Reef. 3 pm: The Orca had made their way to Lund and stayed split up into 3 or 4 groups. Some were by the Savary Island dock area, some by Keefer Rock just off Hernando Island, and the main group of 8 to 10 Transient Orca were by Lund aiming towards Major Rock and Baker Pass.

Listening to the <b>Pt. Townsend hydrophones </b>we began hearing some very faint whistles at about <b>9:30 pm</b> or so. At first they were very distant and faint, and not very frequent. Then by 10 pm they became much louder and we were hearing more calls. They sounded more like dolphin than orca whistles or calls, but we have not yet been able to confirm what it was we were listening to. The calls continued until <b>10:30 or 11 pm</b>. Thankfully Jeanne Hyde was able to record some of the calls. We thought it may have been Pacific White Sided dolphins, which we have heard once before on the PT hydrophone (and they were later sighted off Everett to confirm that hearing!), but some researchers think the calls sound more like Bottlenose dolphins. We will let you know what we hear back from other researchers - but if anyone sees any dolphins in Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, or the San Juan Islands, or hears un-Orca-like whistles on the hydrophones, let us know!

<br/>*<br/>
1:33 pm Received a call from another regular contributor and neighbour, Steve G. of approximately <b>12 Pacific White Sided Dolphins</b> at Westview, Powell River, also heading Northward. A short time later, I received another call from Steve that actually the numbers were more in the neighborhood of <b>60 Dolphins</b>! This is the first time, in a long time that we've had these numbers around...wonderful, but what about the Transients who eat them? <b>320 pm</b> Found the Pacific White Sided Dolphins just arriving at Dinner Rock still heading Northward to Lund. There were closer to 80 of them, slightly spread out, but leaping and wake riding. Since they were heading Northward, I did too. They wake rode all the way back to the line between the Iron Mines and Savary Island when they suddenly broke off. Did they hear the Transients, who by this time were somewhere up closer to Baker Pass and Twin Islands? Jen and Garry both came back to see the Dolphins and I again headed back towards Powell River leaving the animals with them around 4 pm. What a great day...must remember more sunscreen.

The Ocean Magic out of Victoria was able to locate <b>two elusive Minke Whales </b>at <b>Hein Bank (Haro Strait)</b> around <b>1.30pm</b>.

<br/><i>Jon Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Whale Project replied: Thanks for forwarding the minke sighting and photo...it does appear to be a mom/calf pair...it is impossible to be 100% sure as sometimes the size of the minke "changes" depending on surfacing characteristics at the time...but given the other whale as references...it sure looks smaller. and this is the time that calves are about to be weaned from their moms. Then a bit later, this announcement: We have changed Johnney Rotten's name to Chrissy Hynde-Bank...we see this whale a lot at Hein Bank off San Juan Island...I mean, since there seems to be a calf...

Once we got around the corner off of <b>South Beach, San Juan Island</b> we saw a small<b> Minke Whale</b> lift his head to the surface and then slowly roll back under. He surfaced 3 more times and then took a longer dive. We waited about 10 minutes before he surfaced again about a quarter mile away from us. We idled forward in the direction of his last surfacing and saw him come up once more about 250 yards from our boat. It was a great Minke sighting. The smooth, calm water made it easy to see the elusive cetacean.

As we cleared the pass and entered Haro straight Captain Craig pointed our bow south <b>towards Partridge Bank</b>. But half way there we took a sharp right and headed up the straight as we spotted some <b>Orca </b>closer to our position. We came on scene with just a couple other boats and found maybe 8 or so charismatic animals. None of the boats had been able to get positive IDs on any of them.  But there was plenty of surface activity including some porpoising behavior and a few spectacular breaches. We stayed with the whales for about 25 minutes before turning back towards home.

Steve McGee  called Orca Network to report seeing <b>20+ orcas 7 miles south of Klamath River, northern California</b>, in 21 fathoms deep water, 5 miles offshore, heading north. Hmm - possibly some of L or K pods heading north?!
<br/>*<br/>
<b>5 pm:</b> The <b>Orca </b>had spread out a bit withing a triangle from Savary Island, Hernando and Mittlenatch Islands. 
4 pm the Whales had made it about two miles South of Sentry Shoal where they let a lone Dalls porpoise get out of their way. They had been zig zagging towards <b>Powell River</b> then towards Miracle Beach on Vancouver Island. The Orca then grouped up with lots of vocalization. Ahh, calm weather, sunshine, whales and listening to them talking too! They slowly started to work their way back towards Mittlenatch.

We ended up slightly north of the <b>Coal Docks</b> and found ourselves amid <b>Orcas</b>. There were two whales cruising west, then three, then a whole bunch more. They were spread out to the east and west of us and 
we realized they weren't transients. One male with a huge dorsal cruised by and I suspect it was Mike of<b> J pod</b>. At one point there was a large direction change and suddenly the whales were headed east. The best part about the encounter was three moms with calves, cruising close together. The females would surface and then the little guys would pop up for a quick, mini breath.

but no audible calls as they foraged from <b>13:55-15:00</b>. The pod was spread out across the Strait from the SE corner of Lopez Island to near Whidbey Island Naval Base (2 miles offshore was mentioned on the VHF).

<b>Orcas </b>(perhaps as many as three) sighted <b>2:00 PM </b>between <b>NAS Whidbey and Smith Island</b> with 3 whale boats in vicinity.

We headed out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, toward the south end of Lopez Island, many Harbor Seals and male Steller Sea Lions were hauled on Whale Rocks. There were reports of Orcas heading south down<b> Rosario Channel</b>, against a strong, 10+ foot, flooding tide. <b>J-Pod</b> families were very spread out and many turned back north. At about <b>1:45pm</b>, we saw whales swimming hundreds of feet from each other, on long dives, coming up to breathe. Was it energy saving to stay under the surface while they were swimming against that strong current? As fellow Naturalist Heather said; were they staying under longer to communicate about the hunt for salmon, over that long distance the pod was spread apart? We were happy to watch J-26, J-31, and J-39, until about 2:30pm (Didn't see a calf with them, so my guess on J-31 being a new mom is withdrawn)!

Monday found us out in <b>Rosario Strait</b>. The wind was picking up and there was a little bit of swell and chop, but it didn't deter us from spotting a very spread out group of <b>Transient Orcas (possibly J pod?)</b>. They were headed south at what seemed like a pretty good speed. There was one big male about 500 yards from us and two smaller whales another 600 or so yards from him. They had consistent, 4 minute down times and would surface even farther from us every time. The wind made it a challenge to keep up and we realized that the whales were hardly moving, just keeping up with the opposing current. We were the ones drifting and getting blown farther away. The big male continued to surface every 4 minutes or so. Even at 500 yards it was impressive every time. The very top of his towering dorsal would surface first and cut through the water like a shark for a few seconds. Then, slowly, he would rise until the rest of his enormous body was at the surface.

All <b>30+ Transient Orca</b> were up at <b>Robson Bight</b> around <b>9 am</b>. They continued in a Westerly direction then around 3 pm they turned East again heading towards Alert Bay, but still up at the top end of Johnstone Strait. These Orca were doing around 15 knots (close to 30 km per hour!) what Aaron had reported the other day. These reports were noted by Leah and Marie on Orca Live and from Donna of MacKay Whale Watching in Port McNeill. Orca Live had distant calls which could mean they're headed either out the 
top end of Vancouver Island or, based on their previous movements, probably in a big circle and maybe as far down the Strait as our area.

My neighbour across <b>Sansum Narrows</b> on Vancouver Island phoned me at <b>8PM </b>to say he'd been following <b>2 Humpback Whales</b> out of Maple Bay and into Burgoyne Bay.

We followed <b>2 Humpback Whales</b> from <b>Maple Bay on Vancouver Island to Burgoyne Bay on Saltspring Island</b>, and down Sansum Narrows past Burial Island. They were diving and spouting close together and it looked like there was a smaller one with a bigger one - Mum and baby? They were moving pretty fast and went all the way into Burgoyne Bay where the Government wharf is and all the "live-aboards" in boats. This is the first sighting of these baleen whales EVER in Sansum Narrows - anyway since I have been here. (Whales may be sneaking by all the time when my neighbours and I are not watching). Are these whales exploring old territory? Are they 
lost? I believe Sansum Narrows had lots of Humpback Whales long ago before we hunted them to extinction in these waters. I'd love to hear if anyone has any ideas about these magnificent whales. We followed them for about 2 hours - from noon to 2 PM.

The first whales we encountered were a small group containing <b>J2, J8, L87, J19 and J41</b> heading north west toward Salt Spring Island, B.C.

There were several moments in which we were given fantastic displays, including spyhops, breaches, tail-lobs, and inverted swimming. We left the whales at 6:47 p.m. about a half mile north of Coal Island (48° 41.35 N; 123° 21.13 W), and returned to Snug Harbor at 7:20 p.m.

I was driving the Pile Buck northbound up the coast and happened upon a group of possible <b>4-6 Transient Orcas</b>. I was bucking the flood tide in Current Passage making 7kts when a fair sized Orca fin sliced through the water off my starboard bow!, several more to follow. It was an amazing experience as they zipped by with the flood. I believe there was 3 or 4 females; a young calf or year old orca. Also I think there was a young male in the mix that, amongst handling the boat and my camera i didnt get a good look at for sure. Current Passage is in <b>Johnstone strait</b>, near Kelsey Bay. Current passage (northbound traffic) sits on the north side of Helmcken island, and on the south side of helmcken island is Race Passage (southbound traffic). On the north side of Current Passage is Hardwicke island. I encountered the T`s at <b>1112 </b>and I was with them for only minutes.n

When we got closer to <b>Lime Kiln</b> we saw blows way in by the rocks. Then we saw a few more farther north. Then a couple surfaced about half way between us and shore. We soon realized that just about all of <b>J Pod</b> was spread out over a distance of close to 5 miles. It was hard to focus on just one group of whales. I think at that point every passenger was watching a different whale. We picked Blackberry and Mike out of the lineup as well as Looker, the 2010 calf. There wasn't a lot of surface behavior. The whales in close to shore were cruising north at a steady pace and the few different groups farther out looked like they were just slowly milling. We shut down the engine and sat for a long time, observing the whales about their business. None of them were particularly close to us, but Capt Mike dropped the hydrophone and I couldn't believe what I heard. They were, hands down, the best vocalizations I have heard this season. There was even a point when we could hear the whales at the surface, without the hydrophone. A couple of other boats in the area said the same thing. We sat still and silent while we watched and listened in the rain. There wasn't a single noise aside from the whales. It was the type of day that makes you appreciate just how incredible these animals are and how lucky we are to share these islands with them.

By 11:15 am the call was out one the radio that there were around 20 Whales by Marina Island, just off Cortez Island. It didn't take too long and then, by <b>2pm </b>the reports were that the Orca, including T10 T10B and T20 (based on reports from farther South it's doubtful that T20 is in two places at once - wonder who's right or did they move that far so quickly?) were zig zagging in three to four distinct groups within a triangle from Marina, Quadra and Read Islands. There were some on a kill by Viner point at the tip of Read Island. They stayed, spread out in that area until around 4 pm when they headed towards Whale Channel. At this point there was a count of around <b>25 Orca</b>! By the end of the day, the Campbell River Whale Watching crew left them at 5 pm entering Calm Channel by Rendezvous Islands. What a day - breaching, tail slapping and just lots of whale activity!.

I would like to report <b>2 Beautiful Humpbacks</b> my son and I witnessed at <b>0945</b>. They were in Stuart Channel (near <b>Crofton, BC</b>) Chart 3442. We joined them at Erskine Point (<b>Salt Spring Island</b>) and watched them cross to Grave pt and follow the shore to Sherard pt. They continued towards the direction of Porlier Pass. They were calm and serene each time taking 2 -3 breaths then a deep dive with tail fluke rising gracefully before descending.  They appeared to be approximately the same size (adult). There is no mistake these were Humpback whales. I've seen thousands of different whales including whale watching guide. I didn't take pictures as I was video taping them.

Dave Ellifrit, Debbie Sharpe, Kira Kranzler, and Mercedes Powell of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor at 10:50 a.m. with a report of transients just off of Discovery Island, B.C. Approximately seven miles east of Seabird Point (48° 20.83 N,123° 05.77 W) at <b>11:35 a.m</b>. we found the group of seven transients traveling slowly in a tight group, heading south west.

Tonight around <b>7 p.m</b>. as we watched cruise ships head to Alaska we spotted a pod of <b>Orcas</b>.  It looked like a male, two females and two calfs. As they headed nouth toward <b>Marrowstone Point</b>, we thought that was it but then spotted a lone Orca possible transient and then to our surprise another pod of 4 or 5 although my husband thought maybe 6. They were swimming north coming up out of the water quickly and at one point there was some play going on but mostly moving north at a pretty good clip. Not sure if they were eating because they didn't seem to dive long. They were about a mile out from our shore line on Marrowstone Island just south of East Beach. The cruise ships were also in the shipping lanes so they were closer to Marrowstone then Whidbey.

<b>Orca pod</b> at <b>Pt. No Point lighthouse</b> right now (<b>~5 pm</b>)! It seemed like a large group, but difficult to tell how many exactly - maybe about 12 or so, a couple large males in the group and a couple calves as well.

<b>20+ Transient Orcas</b> right off <b>Tumbo Island, BC</b>. Left them at <b>6:30</b> headed West back up the island. Many breeches and above the surface vocalizations.  
<br/>Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA
<br/>*<br/> 
On Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon, after receiving a call, we headed north and west to the north side of <b>Galiano Island</b>, B.C. where we encountered <b>T20 and T21</b> heading east at <b>3:00</b>. Farther east another boat came across <b>T137, T137A and T137B</b>. T137C was not present. Another boat was about 3 miles northwest of our location, returning to Vancouver, and came across <b>several other whales</b>. We did not see those whales and left the scene at 3:40.  We made a return trip and at 5:35 encountered the same whales. However, this time many more whales approached from the west and joined the others. There was quite a lot 
of above water vocalizing and extraordinary surface action. The whales present included some of the same whales that were photographed at Lions Gate Bridge, Vancouver, B.C. Wednesday.  The whales ID'd  on the late encounter were:  <b>T20, T21, T137, T137A, T137B, T100, T100B, T100B1, T100C, T100E, T101, T101A, T101B, T102, T18, T19, T19B, T19C, T23, T23D, T26 and T26A</b>. There was a total of <b>22 whales</b> identified and possibly one or two more. 
<br/>Jeanne Hyde , San Juan Island 
<br/>*<br/> 
We soon got word of a <b>humpback </b>near Porlier Pass, and located it in <b>Trincomali Channel</b>, just south of the pass. This humpback was not exhibiting usual behaviour though. It was surfacing fast, and milling erratically, with just 1 breath per surface sequence and no long, lazy blow. Perhaps it knew what we were about to find out - transient orcas were in the Georgia Strait, and some were near. We headed out of the pass, and slightly south in <b>Georgia Strait</b> for an encounter with <b>T20 and T21</b>. These two individuals are sighted frequently in the area, and just continued on their way south, in typical transient fashion, during our encounter with them. Heading home across the strait, we encountered another 4 individuals - the T101's and T102. This group was also headed south in Georgia Strait. Watching them, we noted how tall T101A's fin is becoming, although still juvenile compared to T102.  As we left them to head for dock at approximately 15:20, we heard that there were yet more transients in Active Pass. Seals,  watch out!   
In answer to an individuals' question about seals and transients in Active Pass (asked in a previous report), I have seen them taking seals in the pass, and I've seen some very nervous seals when they pass through, so I doubt there is any agreement in place. Probably has more to do with whether the whales had already eaten, or perhaps this person is more often watching resident orcas pass through. The seals know the difference and don't budge when the residents pass by.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries reports they were able to get out with the <b>orcas </b>as they came out of <b>Admiralty Inlet</b> heading around Point No. Point this <b>afternoon</b>. They confirmed the pod as members of <b>J pod</b>, very spread out, doing a slow loop first toward Meadowdale, then they headed north, then west, then southwest and finally were heading south as they left them in the early evening. At one point they found J26 about three miles in front of the rest of the whales! The orcas were doing a lot of foraging, which is encouraging, and Brad was able to collect 6+ fecal samples, which will provide important information on what the whales were foraging on, among other things.  
<br/>*<br/>
<b>~4:30 pm</b>: Spotted an <b>orca or two</b> off in the distance through binoculars. Its definitely them -- just saw the first confirmed spout and a small breach. They are somewhere just north of the <b>Kingston-Edmonds ferry</b> now. Still making their way south - Looking like they are slightly favoring the Kingston / President's Point side so far.  Also, doesn't seem like a very large pod - maybe 5-6 from what I can see here in Richmond Beach. If it is J, most of them haven't shown up yet.
<br/><b>~5:45 pm</b>: Here comes another group, further north, again up towards Kingston-Edmonds ferry lane, heading south. Looks like they might be J after all! I was able to make out a breach near the "SF" mid-channel buoy about 5 minutes ago.
<br/><b> ~6:45 pm</b>: I think they are milling a bit north of mid-channel now. I keep seeing shiny whale bodies in the water, but no evident direction.
<b>~6:50 pm</b>: Still milling about 0.5-1 mile north of mid-channel. And suddenly back on the move, heading south! Making their way <br/>slowly south again.

<br/>*<br/>
We got a call about [<b>orcas</b>] north west of Active Pass. A few minutes later we saw two whales surface a quarter mile behind us. It looked like a mom and calf. They were cruising. We turned around and tried to catch up parallel to the whales but they were moving fast. We noticed a single whale in closer to shore and then saw it turn toward the two whales we were watching. The duo did a 180 and became very surface active. Lots of twisting and turning with tails in the air. Eventually the single caught up and then we noticed blood in the water. Not sure what exactly it was but it looked to have been something large and delicious. Once again the whales continued on their eastern course. We watched for a while and then headed home, happy and slightly sunburned.

Ivan had spotted <b>Orcas </b>and we should head to<b> Beaumont Shoal, Haro Strait</b>. As we continued to search we started to see lots of fins in the distance, lots of fins; it must be J-Pod! As we slowly approach we came across <b>J-34 Double Stuff </b>and family. We were treated to 3 great breaches then as the whales approached false bay they slowed down and spent the next hour + in small groups hanging out on the surface, logging, rolling, spy hopping, tail slapping, pec slapping with many small chin ups (see photos here, and John Boyd's photo of the day, above). All in all there must have been 30-40 Spy Hops/chin ups. JB and Hobbes commented that the one time they had seen this type of behavior a new calf was sighted the next day!!! We will see. On top of all of this we had great vocals on the hydrophone, surface vocals and raspberries.  Seemed like a September day in May. Nice to see the whales seemingly content and relaxed, not moving in search of food as they commonly are this time of year.

<b>20 to 25 Orca</b> coming out of Frederick Arm (just above <b>Desolation Sound</b>, north end of the Strait of Georgia) at <b>7:30 am</b>, moving very rapidly Westward. Aaron with Campbell River Whale Watching was out on the water and said he was running at 15 knots to try to keep up with them. Full porpoising out of the water - spectacular sight. By 9:30 am the Orca were into Nodales Channel still in a Westerly direction. I received further updates from Jack during the day, heard bits from Lady Hawk (Jen) and others on the marine radio, as well as AJ later in the day. The Orca split up and spread out. Some zig zagging, some heading Southward toward Seymour Narrows and some staying above the Narrows. By <b>11 am</b> some had entered the Narrows and although the debate was "Who are these whales?" the most likely is that they were Transient Orca. By<b> 5:15 pm</b> there were <b>8 to 10 Orca </b>by Maude - basically they stayed in a small area for a long period of time.

Starting out north on a nice, calm, sunny afternoon, no whale reports. Then, then! a rumor of <b>Orcas </b>in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, heading in east! So we turned around, headed south and west, and started seeing killer whale fins off of <b>False Bay</b> and San
 Juan Island, swimming against an ebbing tide. Closer at about <b>1:15pm</b>, we noticed a female staying in the same place at the surface for about a half hour, and the 5 family groups spread out. They started to move and gather closer together, actively spy hopping, turning on their backs, tail fluke and pectoral fin slapping the water surface, and a juvenile breached! They slowed down their swimming, made circles and direction changes. We put a hydrophone in the water and heard non stop vocalizations!
As we watched all the active behavior, we noticed a very small calf and wonder if a birth had taken place recently? My guess for the mom is J-31 Tsuchi. We also ID'd J-2 Granny, the big boys- J-27 Blackberry, J-26 Mike, J-30 Riptide, and J-28 Polaris and their families. J-Pod seemed relaxed and hopefully found salmon! At 2:45pm they had turned northwest, still off of <b>False Bay</b>.

At 1:21pm we observed a harbor seal in the whales path. Shortly thereafter the whales were milling where the seal had been, presumably having made a kill, although we were unable to see any physical evidence. The transients continued to move slowly north until <b>2:19pm</b>, when they turned and headed south west. At 2:50pm our encounter ended approximately three quarters of a mile south east of Kelp Reef, with the whales moving south west down the middle of the Straight (48° 31.85 N, 123° 12.81 W).

In the afternoon on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the same whales continuing their slow travel up island.  They made a 90 degree turn offshore along Henry Island and then changed direction several times.  We last saw them on the west side of Haro Strait heading down.  I'll post pictures on my blog.

For the second day in a row we found ourselves in <b>Haro Strait</b>. It was another beautiful, glassy day on the water and as we rounded the northwestern corner of San Juan Island we could see blows to the south. There were <b>4 Orca whales</b>. There was one big male with a huge, notched dorsal that was bent over slightly to the left at the very top. There were also two smaller whales (one presumably a female/mother) and a calf in the pod. We watched them dive and maneuvered out alongside of what seemed to be the direction the whales were taking. About 5 minutes later we found out we were wrong. The whales popped up almost a mile southwest of where they dove. A few surface breaths and they dove again.  We sat in the same spot; reluctant to advance because of the previous direction change. The next time the whales surfaced to the east, back toward San Juan. We sat for about 15 minutes and watched them mill.  Through the binoculars we could see Dall's Porpoise right next to the whales! We waited in anticipation for what would surely be lunch.  The whales did a 180 and headed back toward Canada. Apparently they were not interested. Lucky Dall's. With the lighting at a better angle we got a good look at the adult dorsal fins and at the little calf.

We had hiked up Young Hill on <b>San Juan</b> and were looking out over <b>Haro </b>when we saw an enormous <b>Orca </b>breaching repeatedly. There were no other whales nearby and no boats in the immediate area. The size was what was most impressive because even from that distance with no binoculars, this whale seemed very big. Sorry I don't have better details for you. I think it was around 10 am, we didn't see what direction he headed, just breached a bunch then kind of disappeared.

<br/><i>I asked Gretchen if it <b>may have been the humpback</b> that was photographed breaching in Haro Strait about the same time, but she replied: It wasn't a humpback, definitely an orca but I couldn't see his dorsal fin.</i>
<br/>*<br/> 
Around <b>10:30 </b>we found Patch (<b>Gray whale #49</b>) just SE of Sandy Point (<b>SE Whidbey Isl</b>). He was heading generally eastward. We saw his dorsal patch several times and his flukes twice, so it was easy to tell who we were looking at. We also saw six sea lions hauled out on the Possession Point buoy, 2 Californian and 4 Steller's.

My family and I saw some <b>orcas </b>this evening off <b>Point Robinson</b>. I haven't seen any reports of it on West Seattle Blog or your sites, so maybe it's worth mentioning. All we saw were fins and backs, coming up and going under lots of times over about 15-20 minutes, around 6:00 p.m. today. We were at the beach near Point Robinson lighthouse. The orcas started out northeast of the point, moved south a bit, then moved off northeast again before disappearing. From the number of fins surfacing at more or less the same time, I'd guess there were at least four or five whales. They were mainly close together, with a couple of outliers. Since they were nearly in the middle of the channel and we were on land, we couldn't see any particular markings or other individual distinctions.
We live in West Seattle--this was just a day excursion to Vashon--and we hardly ever see orcas or other whales, so we're not really expert observers. We had no camera with us, unfortunately, and therefore also didn't get any photos. But it was a treat to see those lovely whales, nonetheless! Hope someone else also saw them today and has better info for you.
Best,
<br/>Molly Winter, West Seattle
<br/><i>We didn't get any other reports of orcas in the Vashon area, however it's not impossible for Transient orcas to sneak by! however, upon further information from the reporter and some of her descriptions, it is our guess that they MAY have been watching porpoise rather than orcas.</i>

Emily from Beam Reach called Orca Network to report watching <b>two humpbacks</b> west of Kellett Bluff, <b>Haro Strait</b>, from <b>10:30 - 11:30 am</b>, pec-slapping and breaching! Then Mandy Bailey posted this report and photos. A photo of one of the humpbacks that we (Beam Reach) saw breaching this morning! Photo by Carlos Javier Sanchez. This fella started with a breach, did a series of these chin slaps, and ended with another breach. It was amazing!

We headed north and around toward Battleship Island, <b>Haro Strait</b> in search of giants. The calm seas and lack of wind afforded us a quick and comfortable ride out into <b>Haro Strait</b>. As soon as we got past Battleship one of our smaller, younger passengers started yelling and jumping up and down. Whales! The enormous exhalation and tiny dorsal fin were definitely not those of an Orca.  What we had encountered was a much less frequent visitor to the islands. The <b>two Humpback whales</b> took 3 small breaths and then rounded out their backs, curling down until their massive flukes lifted toward the sky. A cheer broke out from every boat within 2 miles. We waited.  Ten minutes later the duo surfaced again. Again, 3 surface breaths and then a dive. We prepared to wait another 10 minutes but the pattern changed. The whales surfaced after only a few minutes had passed. They dove quickly but surfaced again a short time later.  Each time we were clued in to their surfacing by the sound of their exhalations. Magical. Once more the whales came to the surface, lifted their flukes and dove. A moment later we began to notice footprints in a neat little line off our starboard side. We knew the whales were swimming just below the surface. We shut down the boat and waited in anticipation.  The footprints continued for maybe a quarter of a mile before the whales finally surfaced again. We watched as the dove and headed off toward Canada. With plenty of time remaining in our trip we turned north toward <b>Stuart Island</b>. We pulled in close to shore to take a peek at a pair of bald eagles and were surprised by a Steller Seal Lion that popped up behind us. Then a  Harbor Seal Surfaced as well. Suddenly we noticed a tiny animal scurry out of a little cave and slide down into the water. We watched as a River Otter swam along the rocks, looking for a snack. More eagles (including 2 juveniles) and seals on the way back in. What a day for charismatic megafauna!

We spotted some killer whales today and as we got close we could see they had killed a gray whale calf earlier in the morning. It's front half was floating in the water and there were <b>6-7 killer whales</b> present. They'd pull the carcass under the surface for about 8 minutes or so and then it would float back up. They'd break up into mini pods and rejoin several times. There were gulls, shearwaters, and black-footed albatross there as well. Two very young calves in the group, one male, and a few females &amp; juveniles. A boat coming out of Santa Cruz north of us says he came across a lone gray whale on his way over to the action and said it looked like it had a bite wound behind it's blowhole-- possibly the mother of the calf.
Killer whales must hate mothers day.

More Orcas off <b>Moss Landing, CA</b>, this time feeding on a fresh <b>Gray Whale Calf Kill</b>. We were with a pod Orcas on Sunday that had recently killed a Gray Whale calf and were feeding on the carcass. They would bring the carcass up to the surface and take turns nudging it and taking bites out of it. Then they would take the carcass under the water and the carcass would vanish for about twenty minutes. We observed the females cruising the surface back and forth over the area where we would last see the carcass.
There was also a very young Orca calf that still had it's yellowish "white patches". When some Orcas are born, their "white patches" are yellowish in color. They usually will turn white by the end of their first year. This was facinating behavior to observe. We were with the Orcas for over two hours! There were approximately two males, one very large and the other large, three females and two babies.  WOO HOO!

No killer whales today, but we did see <b>Risso's dolphins</b> and <b>Pacific white-sided dolphins</b> mating a few miles west of <b>Moss Landing</b>. There was a pod of around 75 Risso's with just a few lags (Pacific white-sideds). The pairs swam right next to the boat many times and I believed I snapped a shot of the deed in photo 0248 (see photo below). I know there's been lots of accounts of Risso/bottlenose hybrids, anything on Risso's and lags? They sure were having fun!

At <b>6:15 pm</b> I received a call from John and Joan T. asking if I could see the Orca. There were around <b>8 or more Orca</b> - assumed to be Transients doing their longer dives heading Southward relatively quickly in front of Westview, <b>Powell River</b>. Some split off towards Texada, but continuing Southward. The other group were closer to the Mainland side and appeared to be on a kill when I lost them behind some trees just before 7 pm that are in my vantage point view.

At around <b>3:45 PM, a lone male transient</b> came through <b>Active Pass</b>. He milled about Georgeson Bay at the southwest entrance of the pass for about 10 minutes, before heading north up Trincomali channel. What is so interesting about this event, and others like it, is that this occurred at low tide, and there is almost always a large colony of seals sunning themselves on Colinson reef in Georgeson Bay, and yet the transients that come through never seem to be interested. In fact, the seals regularly ignore transients in this area, as if somehow everyone has agreed that this is a no-dinner zone. A neighbour of mine, who has lived on the Bay for most of his 60 plus years has only seen one incident in which transients fed upon seals. Any ideas as to why this might be?

We headed west this afternoon on the <b>12.15pm</b> Ocean Magic vessel and found <b>a Transient Orca</b> that appeared to be all alone near <b>Sooke</b>. It was slowly heading west with erratic turns that would head it east then west. Despite the cold wind, the rain and chop on the seas it was good to watch this rather illusive animal. Looked like a sprouter male initially, but some of those sharp, tall fins can be deceiving. It had a nice nick out of its fin, roughly a little more than a third down on its trailing edge. Hopefully someone knows who it was. Closest image in the catalogue to mine looks like T124C, a female, but why, if a she, was she alone.

We picked up <b>2 killer whales</b> at 54/57 at <b>11:30 am</b> milling about at around 3 knots. They surfaced together and separated several times, often staying down for over 8 minutes. There were several little pods of harbor porpoise in the area. At 12:30, the killer whales picked up speed and darted after some porpoise and definitely killed at least one-- there was blood in the water and we could see the harbor porpoise in both the male &amp; female's mouths at different times. I believe the female is CA50, not sure about the male-- his eye patch is a perfect oval. The kill was made at 53/54. In picture 0135 you can see part of the harbor porpoise.
So cool!

After picking up a friend at sea/tac we caught the <b>8:30 p.m. ferry from Mukilteo</b>. As the ferry was pulling out of the Mukilteo terminal (heading to Clinton) - we spied - approx. 100 yds from the ferry - on the west (left) side ( in some 'turbulent' water ) and watched for several minutes - what appeared to be - either a gray whale (which was diving and feeding) - or - an orca (or more than one orca). We could not figure out if it was the tail of <b>a gray whale</b> - or the fin on top of an orca - that would appear above the surface - then disappear. Any thoughts or other reports  that would confirm either?

I just saw a <b>Grey Whale</b> near <b>Whidbey Island</b> within <b>Holmes Harbor</b> about 2 miles north of <b>Freeland </b>on the east shore (this location is a bit south of the above report - the whales must have gone down toward Freeland, then circled back north to be seen about two hours later by Pat Harper). Google maps approximate location is: 48.040701,-122.509987. There were probably <b>two whales: an adult and an infant</b>. There is a sand bar there with ghost shrimp, so the whales were probably feeding. They swam around in circles for about half an hour before heading south toward Freeland.

Some were in way close to shore, while another group of younger animals were porpoising a little farther out. Other boats confirmed sightings of 'Doublestuf', and we were able to confirm sightings of 'Blackberry', who had a very consistent pattern of slow breaths and very slow descents, leaving his dorsal skimming along the surface.

A group of <b>orcas </b>had been spotted coming out of <b>Active Pass</b> heading East. So off we went with hopes of finding them somewhere out in the Strait of Georgia. We headed down to Eastpoint, and began scanning towards Alden Bank. And that's when we got word that <b>Transient </b>calls were being heard on the <b>Orca Sound hydrophones</b>. So off we went, and after a long trip, we were passing through John's Pass when we got yet another call--Transients in Active Pass. As we were passing Danger Shoal, we got yet another call--this time on the radio that one of the boats had found whales near <b>Moresby Island</b>. <b>J Pod</b> had mysteriously shown up, and we were glad to see them!  We first encountered J26 Mike, and also saw J27 Blackberry and J30 Riptide (who seems to be growing larger all the time!) Then the fun began as we viewed what I call the "nursery group" of four juvenile whales. They were so content to hang out together, rolling around on each other, and occasionally displaying a "sea snake".  Lots of upside-down swimming, pushing each other sideways.   We saw L87 show us how the whales hunt fish with lots of lunging, direction changes, and a couple of high lunges!

I was kayaking with my wife near <b>Saltery Bay</b> just off the east end of Hardy Island in Hotham Sound, B.C. (south of Powell River).
A pod of <b>5 [orcas</b>] came north from Scotch Fir Point heading east toward Jervis Inlet. There appeared to be a large male swimming beside a large female and off to one side there were three younger orcas. I took some photos of the larger one which breached a few times (see photo below, and above photo of the day) . The orca that I am assuming is the big male was playing with what I am assuming was a larger female, swimming very close to her, rubbing against her and then breaching every so often. They continued this pattern as far as the eye could see.
