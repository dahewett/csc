<b>5 PM Trip</b> with Captain Gary. Epic evening with <b>J Pod and the K14's in the Strait of Georgia</b>! Beautiful light, beautiful water and beautiful whales! -Photo by Gary Sutton, Ocean Ecoventures WW, June 30

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Well this certainly doesn't happen every day! The <b>T49As headed right into Friday Harbor tonight</b> as we headed home from our evening trip. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu, June 30

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Day report: On June 30th we got to see<b> many different transient orcas</b>. We met them near <b>Salmon Bank at around 11am</b>. The first whales we saw were the<b> T37As and T36Bs who were joined by T51</b>. They passed very closely to Whale Rocks alerting the one steller sea lion on the rock. <b>Another group of orcas</b> in the distance were the first to enter <b>Cattle Pass </b>against the ebb which included the <b>T99s</b> and maybe some others. All orcas travelled into <b>Upright Channel</b>. We witnessed a predation event near the<b> entrance to East Sound on Orcas Island with the 37As and 36Bs</b>. The others were on the other side of East Sound about 2 miles distant near Peavine Pass. Shortly after they joined together and headed along the <b>west side of Blakely Island and through Thatcher Pass about 6:30pm</b>. Earlier in the day the <b>T49As were reported near Beaumont Shoal</b>. They <b>also came through Cattle Pass and we caught up with them at 8pm near Turn Island</b>. Many long dives - they zig zagged their way right into Friday Harbor. They appeared to be milling/maybe hunting in the middle of the harbor. They took the pass behind Brown Island and into Shipyard Cove where they were milling for quite awhile in the far back of the cove. T37A with youngest calf who has an interesting dorsal fin. -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:55 p.m. - </b>Marie of WS Ferries relayed a report from the ferry Elwha of <b>at least five orcas in Upright Channel</b>, between Lopez and Shaw islands, heading NW, and that the captain is hearing there are three groups along the channel.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Saw these beauties at the <b>south end of Lopez island today. I believe T37As and T51</b>. This was about <b>1:30 </b>in the afternoon. They were definitely hunting. They were circling and going from small island to island looking for seals. They started off in the channel between San Juan island and Lopez island then heading east along the south end of Lopez island. They reached the end of Lopez island and turned around to retrace their route. -Danielle Pennington

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

SO MANY transients in the area, was hard to keep track of who was where. We found the<b> T37As and T36</b> in the morning out at <b>Hein Bank</b>, heading E/NE, while the<b> 49As were over by Victoria. T51 was also out in the Strait </b>at this time, as we could see him to the north. Then we heard reports of the 99's, 36As and Bs too<b>!! The 37As were traveling with T36</b> at a moderate pace in a tight group when we found them, but later split up as they started to hunt. Most are zoomed and cropped but we did have several close surfacings. <b>T37A3, T37A, T36 and T37A2. Matriarch, 37A and 37A4, sustained an injury to the dorsal at some point last year.</b> -Renee Beitzel

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Seen <b>south of Lopez Island around 11:30am</b> today. Appeared to be hunting at times spread out. There were about <b>4 total</b>. Heading southeast but changing direction a lot. I was on the Chilkat...-Photo by Karen Sziel, June 30

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12 PM Trip</b> with Captain Gary. <b>T065A's and T075B's</b> again today! They have been hanging out the area for quite a while now. We had them travelling down <b>Swanson channel towards the San Juan Islands</b>. -Gary Sutton

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:45 p.m.</b> - The M/Y Alchemy is reporting <b>Orcas</b> traveling along side their ship, same direction Southbound heading, (map indicates mid channel <b>between south Salt Spring and North Pender Islands</b>). -Christopher Joyce, Sea Shepherd, June 30

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>11:31 a.m. -</b> Just sighted inside <b>Strait of Georgia off Galiano Island heading south. (in Trincomali Channel, SW side of Galiano) We saw at least 3.</b> They went in opposite direction so they were farther away... Orcas were fast though heading south. -Petra Schindler-Carter

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Approx <b>430pm: Humpback NW, off Dash Point mid water between there and Vashon Island</b>.  It was headed north surfacing several times before I was able to get my phone out. Video show it turning south towards Commencement Bay. Thank you for what you do! -Ed Rodriguez

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:58 a.m. - Humpback Whale</b> sighting circling around <b>Quartermaster harbor</b>. Heading South, towards Commencement bay/point defiance. -Angie Mader

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:00 a.m. - Whale in inner Quartermaster Harbor</b>. Spotted a small (30') possible Fin whale (was <b>humpback</b> - ALB) cruising around the Burton Peninsula in Quarermaster Harbor at 8 a.m. June 30th. Feeding or traveling. -Joe Wald

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 30 - <b>7:00 p.m. - Quartermaster / Vashon. A single humpback whale</b> was sighted near the southern side of the entrance Quartermaster Harbor at <b>7PM</b>. Multiple sightings of small dorsal fin and one sighting of a (very large) fluke. Whale started in southerly direction and turned NE before diving. Viewed from 38' ketch - S/V Elsa. Three witnesses on board. -Michael Johnson

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>Dall's porpoise -</b> June 30 - <b>11:00 a.m. </b>- Larry Liedtke came into the Whale Museum and mentioned (and filmed) <b>15-20 Dall's porpoises</b> swimming next to his sailboat. Playing and traveling. He said he was about <b>four miles west of Cattle Point</b>. He said the porpoises stayed with him for about two miles, and I believe he said they were all traveling north. -Report sent by Stephanie Lawrence

<b>7:44 p.m. - </b>tuned into <b>Lime Kiln hydrophone and was hearing  echolocation</b> under boat noise. A few minutes later started <b>hearing calls</b> and watched few whales pass northbound on the webcam. By <b>8:15pm a few more on the webcam</b>. For the next hour listened in heard mostly <b>S1</b> calls, with some whistles, and a lot of echolocation. At <b>8:40pm I switched over to Orca Sound for a few minutes heard faint calls</b>, one of which was same descending call as first heard on Lime Kiln when I tuned in at 7:44pm. Back on Lime Kiln at <b>8:44pm there was a repeating S2 call</b>. Back on <b>OS at 8:55 heard quite a few calls from both Js &amp; Ks.</b> Through out this time on both hydrophones heard <b>S1, S2, S6, and K calls</b>. At <b>9:22 pm there were still audible vocals on Lime Kiln</b>. 
Later on Orca Sound heard an array of calls: S1, S3, S10s, S16 and S17s and echolocation. At 10:05pm I made note of really nice loud <b>vocals on OS in mostly quiet seas and have phone recordings time stamped at 10:10pm</b>, I stopped listening just after that. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network  

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 29: On a gorgeous summer day, we caught up with the leaders of the<b> Southern Resident group around Salmon Bank</b>. They were actively fishing, with many turns and erratic surfacing. We had wonderful looks at big male <b>K26 Lobo, his mom K14 Lea</b>, as well as <b>some of J pod</b>, including one of the calves born in 2015. And the end of our time with them, a large group started surfacing together in the brilliant sunshine, which was absolutely beautiful! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Had such a great day today on the water with an approach and close pass by the<b> J19's and J22's! J16's were out there too</b> along with the <b>K14's</b>...and finally got to see my fave, K26 Lobo pictured here as they headed down island, SJI. -Photo by Renee Beitzel, June 29

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

We had a quick look at<b> a humpback whale who was heading down San Juan Channel and out through Cattle Pass </b>on June 29, 2017 around noon. We also saw the Residents-many<b> J's, K14's, and L87</b> when they were<b> returning from Salmon Bank and heading up the west side of San Juan Island </b>spread in many loose groups. J38 was very active when the Residents all flipped to head south as they approached Lime Kiln Point State Park...tail slapping, a half breach, multiple spy hops while slapping his pec fins on the water. -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 28 - <b>North Puget Sound - 6:45 pm. - </b>There has been a whale past 24 hrs (assuming it stayed after our moonlit watching it and now see it today 6:45pm outside off <b>186th &amp; Sound View Place, Edmonds</b>. Maybe humpback. -Anaisa Gerbig 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:05 p.m. - for last hour humpback(s)</b> has been milling/foraging continuously, northbound southbound in same general area. Surface of 4-5 times for about a minute before sounding/fluking for a few. Healthy blows, all only visible with binoculars. From <b>Ocean Ave in Edmonds</b> sight line primarily mid Double Bluff, Whidbey. Probably 2 whales based on times but too far to confirm and have not seen them surface together. Seas choppy, sky clear with some incoming marine air resulting in some haze further west, mild wind.  
<br/><b>11:03 a.m. -</b> spotted blows, then gorgeous all-white pec fin waving high in the air, then a pec slap, then deep dive showing fluke. At least <b>3 miles west of north Edmonds </b>and 3 miles south of Possession Point. Boat obscured view so not sure if diving whale was same as Pec waver or 2nd whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:25 a.m. - 2 breaching humpback whales at Possession Bar</b> 15 minutes ago! <b>Orion (BCX1251)</b> was one of them. We just left the scene. -Bart Rulon, Chilkat 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:53 a.m. - Humpback seen South of Kingston Edmonds ferry</b> crossing; video in about 40 minutes. -Doug Hayman 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>6:13 a.m. - Whale north of Edmonds ferry</b> that I could see from the Sounder. Could not pinpoint type with the train flying by. If I had to guess it was a <b>Humpback</b>. -Kevin H Doar 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>12:14 p.m. - Minke whale northbound just adjacent to Partridge Point.</b> I'm not on Chilkat just hiking at Ebeys Landing. -Renee Beitzel 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>June 28 - Maury/Vashon - </b>There were several sightings of <b>a whale between Glacier and Maury Marine Park</b>. A group of us watched it from <b>8:30 pm to a little after 9 p.m.</b>. It came astonishingly close to shore on the west side of that passage. Maybe 50 feet from the water's edge? We watched as it migrated slightly north and then east further toward to middle of the passage. It was surfacing, blowing, etc. It was stunningly huge and loud. So unexpected and utterly amazing! -Barbara Weber

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 28 - central Puget Sound Humpback (reported as: or possible fin) whale sighting June 28 <b>Meadow Point at approximately 7:30 pm</b>, we noticed a large whale surface about 150 ft from our boat. The whale was larger than whales I have seen in the area in the past. We were initially thinking it was a humpback, but the size of the whale, and the fact that in three separate dives it did not fluke, has me wondering if it was in fact a fin whale. Traveling, we saw three dives, ten spouts, no flukes or fin slaps. (confirmed humpback, see report below) -Jason Christensen

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

June 28 - Here are some photos from an experience we had with <b>two humpback whales at the south end of Possession Bar</b> on Chilkat Express, the morning of June 28. It was<b> BCX1251, Orion</b>, with another whale that I didn't see the flukes well enough to identify.  The two whales breached multiple times in a row, and we even saw several cartwheels that appeared to be aggressive in nature between the whales, with one whale almost landing on top of the other!! <b>BCZ0180, Monarch</b>, doing a cartwheel north of Romeo Buoy on the morning of June 28 -Bart Rulon, Naturalist Puget Sound Express

June 27 - North Puget Sound - The familiar sound of a <b>Humpback full breach. 10:30 pm, Mutiny Bay</b>. -Heather Nicholson 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:30 - 9:25 p.m. - I moved to Haines Wharf, north Edmonds</b> and spotted both whales close together first just about 1/4 mile offshore. They continued to circle around anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 mile offshore milling, foraging around together in the waning light. Regular  surface  patterns with directional changes, sounding showing flukes each time. Gorgeous afternoon into evening. That's where I leave them. 
<br/><b>7:00- 8:15 p.m. -</b> Both whales were staying around west side of Possession Bar, and now both have made their way east. One last seen SE of Possession Point, the other is currently 1/4 mile off shore from probably around Haines Wharf, north Edmonds diving in super calm seas. 
<br/><b>6:52 p.m. -</b> whale 2 moved on NE. S/he is just out here milling in wide area, quite lazily. Little fishes jumping everywhere! 
<br/><b>6:45 p.m. - </b>different whale surfacing further west south of Cultus Bay. Maybe first whale I was watching. #2 (closer to Edmonds whale) is sightline towards Possession Point but well southeast of more on Edmonds side of channel just logging/resting. 
<br/><b>6:13 p.m. -</b> nice series of surfacing then subtle dive, showing fluke. Directionally westbound. (close in whale) 
<br/><b>6:00 p.m. -</b> 2nd whale much closer to Edmonds. North end maybe 1/2-1 mile offshore, currently southbound.

Gorgeous early morning with<b> Jpod and the K14's!</b>. An early start to the morning because <b>J pod and the K14's were coming past Lime Kiln State Park</b>! A gorgeous calm morning out there! These guys were going against a very strong ebb tide. I hope these guys continue to find Chinook Salmon. Counts at the Fraser River haven't been very good. So much work needs to be done to restore the salmon runs in the Salish Sea. Everyone needs to commit to major actions for the salmon or we will loose this precious community of Killer Whales, the Southern Residents. -Video by Traci Walter, June 25

Well, it sure has been <b>humpback heaven</b> lately. Sorry but I've got more breaching humpbacks for you, only this time from the Strait of Juan de Fuca including one of our favorite whales. On June 24, Chilkat Express was on scene with <b>a lone humpback just north of Dungeness Spit</b> when we looked off to the west and saw multiple breaches from other humpback whales about 3 miles away</div></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>. We didn't waste any time cruising over to take a look, and the breaching continued as we got closer. When we arrived I realized that we had <b>BCX1068, Split Fluke, traveling with a new calf!!</b> The calf was breaching over and over again, and mom was breaching about once for every breach from her calf. Intermixed with the breaches they would slap their pectoral fins on the surface over and over again, until one, or both of them would arch their backs, raise their tail flukes and dive down deeper only to come flying out of the water within a few seconds! Incredibly exciting!! We must have seen at least 50 breaches, if not more, from the time we first spotted them. All the breach photos I attached are from the calf, but I do have one photo with the pectoral fins in the air from both animals! It was hard to choose what photos to send because there were so many of them!! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist Chilkat Express

Strait of Georgia - A little patience pays off sometimes when watching whales. We were with <b>2 Humpback whales in the Strait of Georgia</b> this morning. They were cruising along zigging and zagging and occasionally showing their flukes. On the last surfacing we stayed to watch these two, suddenly out of nowhere they each did a cartwheel throwing their massive flukes in the air! What a sight to see!!

Gray (or unconfirmed) whales - (<i>categorizing as gray since <b>reported as gray and further details provided sounds plausible</b> based on description. Leaving open possibility it is one of the humpbacks who has been confirmed feeding int he bay - ALB</i>)
At approximately <b>930PM,</b> Monday, June 19, my wife and I sighted <b>a Gray Whale</b> that surfaced about 100 yards offshore in front of 6358 Barr Beach Rd<b> in the middle of Mutiny Bay</b>. Our attention was drawn to the whale by the sound of his blow hole breath upon surfacing. He seemed to alone and continued north up the bay, surfacing to breath every 2 or 4 minutes, audible for us for the next 20-30 mins. Not sure, but possibly feeding on herring. We seen lots of schools/herring balls in recent days.
...I'm no expert, so yes, it's possible it was a Humpback. It was dusk and the whale was about 100 yards from shore, but directly in front of me. I saw a dark gray and mottled white back rolling forward, accompanied by a two-way blow hole breath. The breath was fairly prolonged and almost melodic. No fin was exposed. If the other sighting was definitively a Humpback, then I would guess I saw the same whale.
As I stayed outside and it darkened, I heard the whale return in the opposite direction it came (now heading S by SW), blowing at the same rate as before, but now more like 500-600 yards out. I had no visual of the whale, but could hear  it clearly. -Mark Van Hollebeke

June 17 - San Juans -<b> Salmon Bank, the T65Bs and T36As</b> engaged in hunting a harbor porpoise or, at least, that's what it appeared to be at first. They very easily could have made the kill, but seemed to be either playing with it or having a training session (or both) with the young ones in the group. On several occasions, I observed one of the juveniles on the tail of the porpoise as it came up, while the adults followed slowly behind. Every now and then, the matriarchs and teenagers would engage but the porpoise always resurfaced and kept on going.  We <b>arrived at 1517 and when we left at 1545</b>, they were still taunting it! -Renee Beitzel

We live up in Emerald Shores, so, from the distance we saw them (from our back deck), they appeared to not be Orcas, but <b>possibly Minkes or even Humpbacks</b>. Behaviors: moving, arching out of the water and spouting. -Dennis Arneson

Juan de Fuca - <b>Lunging humpbacks! Three of them</b> in the same area today lunge feeding, Strait of Juan de Fuca just <b>east of Dungeness Spit</b>. We got mugged by one of them but it was only a fleeting mugging. Never saw flukes because they were lateral lunge feeding.  Turns out this is the 2014 calf of <b>BCY0324-Big Mama</b>! -Photo by Renee Beitzel, June 14, 2017

L-Pod hadn't been seen in Haro Strait since October 28th of last year (our last research encounter of 2016!), but we were hopeful all that would change yesterday with word of <b>inbound Ls off of Sooke. The majority of the pod turned and went back west, but the L12 sub-group did make it all the way "in" to San Juan Island</b>. This afternoon we had them in a resting line off Land Bank, part of a nearly 5 hour encounter with them! -Monika Wieland Shields 
 
<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
 
Some great <b>calls as some of L pod is passing by Lime Kiln Pt</b>. and the Lime Kiln hydrophone at<b> 5:55 pm</b>. -Susan Berta, Orca Network 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>L22 and L89 came up to Edwards Points</b> and then turned south again while the <b>L12s continued north</b>. They seemed to be resting and milling off the Westside Preserve for the few hours I was there, then finally picked up a bit of speed and <b>passed Lime Kiln around 4:30.</b>
<br/><b>3:39 p.m. - They're still at Land Bank</b> going very slowly. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

<b>T65A's north of Patos</b> - We had a incredible encounter with the T65A's about 4 miles north of Patos. Shortly after we arrived, the orcas began hunting a harbor seal. The seal spent quite a bit of time lying at the surface while the orcas powerfully lunged in circles all around him. Lots of tail thrashing by T65A. The predation event lasted 25 minutes. We also recorded some vocalizations while they were eating. We were the only boat on scene. -Cheers, Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

<b>North Puget Sound - 4:55 p.m.</b> - My wife and I were on the 13 June 4:40 pm <b>Kingston to Edmonds Ferry</b> and saw several splashes (<b>multiple whales, at least three </b>possibly more) at a distance to the north. Couldn't tell what type they were. No breaches, but several fluke slaps and humps. They seemed to be playing, but could possibly have been feeding, too far to tell. Likely gray or humpback? (<i>Humpback, see report below by Stu Davidson</i>). -Ross Holcomb

Believe this to be <b>Orion Humpback Whale BCX </b>1251 that was back-and-forthing for many hours today <b>between Point No Point and Eglon</b> east of the shipping lanes. Nothing cooler than a whale-tail waterfall!

Pacific white-sided dolphins - We encountered a pod of <b>about 100 Pacific white-sided dolphins in Queen Charlotte Strait</b>. They were spread out over the span of a mile at first, actively hunting in the mixing currents. At one point I photographed the dolphins frantically chasing salmon right at the surface! I got a few photos of the salmon being knocked into the air but could not identify exactly which species of salmon they were. After a half hour of feeding they all grouped up and started traveling north together. -Bart Rulon

Early reports of Orca off Sooke from a local fisherman had me on the water before our morning tour and was excited to be one of the first to welcome <b>"L" pod back to the Salish sea</b>. Seems they were foraging close to shore in the kelp beds in search of Salmon. Hopefully the Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales will find plenty of food to keep them around for a while. We sped off to catch <b>L Pod still fighting a strong ebb and foraging at Race Rocks</b>. -Paul Pudwell 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

Today we had several different groups of Killer whales in the area. <b>L pod was heading in from the Pacific, The T2C's were off the west side of San Juan Island this morning, and there was another group of Bigg's Killer whales in Rosario Strait</b>. The T2C's! A very special family group for a number of reasons. Firstly, T2C is the daughter of T2, a female that had been captured in Pedder Bay near Victoria, BC back in the 70's and on her way to be shipped to another marine park when she and another whale were released. It's only because of her release that this group exists. T2 is no longer with us, but this is her daughter and grandchildren. In addition, one of T2C's kids T2C2 "Tumbo" has scoliosis of the spine. He's not able to hunt for himself and his family does the hunting and will share with him. Killer whales are such dedicated family members and this tenderness between family members is quite amazing to see. This family typically hangs out in the Campbell River area, but they have been around in the San Juans the last week. Wonder how long they will stick around! Sure is plenty of food for them. Here's a LINK with more information about this incredible family and the history of T2. -Traci Walter, Western Prince

<b>Eastern Juan de Fuca - </b>Tonight's<b> Transient Killer Whale </b>encounter was among the best I've ever had! Dozens of orcas were playing, hunting, and feeding together. <b>T123A</b> Stanley was kind of the star of the show as he was in most of the photos I took, but <b>in addition to the T123s, we also saw the T124s, T101s</b> and so many more it was hard to keep track! All photos here were taken on 6/12/17 near <b>Minor Island</b>. -Justine Buckmaster 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>5:05 p.m. - Large group of 25 Bigg's/Transients in eastern Juan de Fuca near Smith and Minor Islands</b> on multiple kills, lots of breaches. Circles....literally they were on the East side of Smith and Minor, lots of kills, travelling in circles. -Janine Harles 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>North Puget Sound - About 4:30</b> Marilyn saw a blow as we were coming down the hill towards Haines Wharf. About <b>4:40 from Haines Wharf park we saw the humpback</b> surface <b>about a mile west of north Edmonds </b>in northerly direction, did not see him surface again, he may have flipped back and surfaced behind some trees in our way. I moved a little bit south and and scouted until about <b>5:30</b> but never saw him again. Conditions were beautiful calm, but I was somewhat distracted some by other events. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network &amp; Marilyn Armbruster

June 12 - I've attached photos from the photo expedition I lead up to the <b>Discovery Islands in BC</b>, Canada every year. Besides black bears, brown bears, and thousands of eagles we usually photograph Pacific white-sided dolphins, and humpback whales too. This year we had an amazing experience with <b>two humpback whales just north of Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park</b>, at the very north end of Georgia Strait.  We had<b> BCXuk2012#3 (Spotlight), and BCX0565 (Nick)</b> on this particular encounter on June 12.  At first they appeared to be resting together, with lots of surface time and swimming slowly, but no deep dives. Then, out of nowhere they raised their tail flukes for deep dives and they started breaching over and over again! They followed that up with hundreds of pectoral fin slaps mixed in with some breaches here and there! The action, went on for at least an hour before they slowed down and things went back to normal again.  It was one of the most amazing humpback whale experiences I've ever had!! -Bart Rulon

The <b>T2Cs</b> are currently our resident <b>Transients</b>. We met them on our doorstep after leaving them at <b>East Point</b>. Reduced sail as their family waits for T2C2, dependent on them and moving very slowly with his condition of Scoliosis. With his slow progress they changed their minds in the flood of Cattle Pass to retrace track to the North. Looked like his family shared the catch of the hunt near Yellow Island. The sunset was amazing. The T2C's are still in our area. -Barbara &amp; David

<b>Boundary Pass -</b> Sunset moonrise sail. The only whales we knew of were way to the North. However we knew that they could get going and head South so we planned accordingly sailing <b>Presidents Channel</b> in the evening light. An eagle caught a fish right in front of us and swam breast-stoke to shore with wings. Waking from the siesta were the harbor seals of the crystal coves of the jeweled islands. Arrived at East Point to a furious flurry of very close whales before they split into a wide sweep across Boundary Pass in the still waters of sunset. And the moon rose full to their distant blows. (Mix of <b>T124As and T65As - the T2Cs split off at East Point</b>). -Barbara &amp; David, All Aboard Sailing

<b>Active Pass - ...a larger group of orcas was visible off Edith Point on Mayne island on Friday at 130pm</b>, followed by 7 whale-watching boats. They were splashing and very active, probably fishing. Trending South toward Saturna, but quite a distance from shore. -Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island, BC, Canada

<b>Haro Strait -</b> Today we found ourselves up in Haro Strait after a report of "many orcas" inbound in the morning. When we arrived they were really spread out with a few individuals traveling alone and others in small groups. We learned that one of them was a really rare transient, <b>T170</b>, ID'd by Center for Whale Research and that he had only been seen once in Haro before but that it had been quite some time. Cool! Then, I was able to ID one of our "regulars", <b>T49C</b>, as he was by himself, trailing behind the rest. Only after going through photos though, did I discover the "others" were the T36As and a few too far to ID. -Renee Beitzel 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>

This morning some<b> transient killer whales</b> Monika has never seen before passed the<b> west side of San Juan Island</b>. From her photos we identified at least <b>T170, T172, T117A, and T117B</b>, rare visitors to this area, traveling with the <b>T36As and T49C</b>, who are regularly seen. Not only is it awesome to meet "new" whales, it's humbling to be reminded just how little we know about these populations of whales that are our neighbors. By documenting what goes on here, we hope to gain at least a little more insight into their lives! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

<br/><b>6:55 p.m. - </b>Both under for several minutes could go either direction, Colvos or towards Maury. Neighbor says he has seen them hanging out all day here though. 
<br/><b>6:45 p.m. - 2 for sure</b>. Lots of time between surfacing, right in front of our house now, smaller one keeps surfacing westbound now, large one has been under for a while. 
<br/><b>6:40 p.m. - Just saw one humpback, maybe 2</b> (because there was so much body), surface and spout twice at point Dalco. Appeared to be <b>headed northeast towards pt. Defiance</b>. -Sarah Bradford Honeywell 

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>8:35 a.m. - Humpback between Vashon Island and Point Defiance</b>, headed north towards Sunrise Beach. Biiig blows! Saw him for only about 5 minutes, but he was moving very quickly north into the Colvos. (Sunrise Beach is in Gig Harbor). -Gaby Kinner

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>3:50 p.m. - Sighted a smaller baleen whale just North of the Kingston Ferry.</b> Sharply pointed dorsal, low blow, followed alongside the Schooner Adventuress for about 10 minutes. Believe it was a minke (<i>is <b>humpback</b>, see photo below - ALB</i>) based on size, dorsal shape, and behavior. She was headed South.

The <b>T2Cs</b> are an incredible family group of <b>transient killer whales</b> that we were lucky enough to encounter this evening. Not only are they descendants of some of the first and most well known transients like T1 Charlie Chin and the white whale Chimo, but one of their ranks is this whale, <b>T2C2 Tumbo, a 12 year-old male who has scoliosis</b>, resulting in a heavily deformed spine. As the rest of his family traveled together, he was trailing about a mile behind. But then they stopped and appeared to pin a harbor seal on the bottom. Once they killed it, he came in to join them in the feasting. It is through their altruism that he has made it this long. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, June 7

The <b>T124As and T101s were traveling together</b> and it was a lovely evening to visit them. Here's <b>T102, T124A3, T101, and T124A1 in Swanson Channel</b>.

<b>Coastal killer whales -</b> We received a call from Jesse Logan, relaying a report of <b>3 - 6 orcas off Heceta Head, OR</b> observed sometime <b>between 5 - 6 pm</b>. He saw lots of splashing and lots of birds, looked like they made a kill off Heceta Head, then they headed north very fast, about 100 meters from shore. He followed them up to Rock Creek but then lost them. He took some distant photos and video which he will send us tonight, and we'll forward on if there is anything identifiable or useful in them.

<b>Dalco Pass - 7:55 p.m. </b>- Another one or the same one on the <b>Commencement Bay side of the Point Defiance ferry lane</b> right now headed toward Ruston near the Copperline apts. A boat just floated over there and the whale dove under but we watched it for maybe 5 or 10 minutes.
<br/>My mom and I saw a very clear (<b>gray or humpback?</b>) spout twice today, <b>west side of the Point Defiance ferry around</b> <b>5:45-5:50 this evening</b>. We didn't get a great look but it was big enough to be a whale. I didn't notice a dorsal, and the only color I saw was darker, similar to a seal...but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Nothing more to add except that the spray from the blowhole was high and significant. Definitely very dark color -Kelli Michelle

<b>Common dolphins - June 7 - Central Puget Sound - 1:00 p.m.</b> - still out there, kind of between me and <b>Fay Bainbridge</b> park now, still trending north. There are quite a few of them actually, strung out between Magnolia and Fay Bainbridge, look to be east of mid channel. Coming up and then staying down for quite a bit. Foraging? 
<br/><b>12:23 p.m. - </b>These may be the ones I'm seeing straight out from the ship canal, headed northbound, east of mid-channel.  (These were definitely <b>dolphins</b>) They had rather long dorsal fins though. I would have almost thought they were orca except for the frequency of appearance and the lack of the breathing pause and discernible blow. (Looking through binoculars). -Sandra Prow

<b>10:50 a.m. -</b> probably those same <b>dolphins</b> are now north of the ferry lane, I can only see them with binoculars from my "perch" <b>above Pier 55</b>. They aren't moving fast and are quite spread out, but do seem to be trending north. Hard to count but I've seen maybe 6 pop up at any given time. (Definitely not the humpback, that's what I've been trying to catch sight of.) -Donita Gier

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>10:48 a.m. - </b>Just saw one single (I believe it's a <b>dolphin</b>) headed steadily south at a good clip, viewing from <b>Me-Kwa-Mooks</b> park. Already probably <b>close to the WS/Vashon ferry lane</b>. Also just saw a second one pass the same spot I'm at, so if there is a pod they are spread kinda far apart. Definitely too small for a humpback and no spout seen. I'm almost certain they are the dolphins someone was seeing earlier. -Brian-Nicole Jenkins

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>9:55 a.m. - likely Common dolphins in Elliott Bay.</b> South of Bainbridge ferry lanes heading east or northeast. Viewing from Alki, straight out line of sight from Marine Ave SW.

Tuesday 6/6. Special day. I was able to watch the <b>T65As</b> do a close pass by of <b>SJ County Park</b>. After they passed, I headed to the land bank where I was scheduled to volunteer as the naturalist for the 2-5pm shift. I assumed the family would've passed the land bank already by the time I got there, but as I stepped out of the car I saw them still slowly heading my way, just entering the northern land bank. Once they made it to <b>the middle land bank where I was, they stopped and stayed there with me. They stalled out there for 3.5 hours</b>, not leaving until I packed up my gear and started walking up the hill. This is my favorite T family, and it was so good to see all <b>five</b> of them looking healthy and vibrant. The kids have all done some growing, especially T65A2 who I refer to as Chaser. I always see him chasing something but have yet to see him catch something. It was magic. <b>Leader is T65A, the sprouter in T65A2 "Chaser" and in the back is T65A3</b>. I think the little one is T65A5 since he/she is always tucked in next to mom. T65A4 isn't pictured but was present. That one loves hanging by big bro A2.

<br/><b>8:00 a.m.-  Whale (not orca) between Harstine and McMicken Islands in Case Inlet</b>. Whale heading north. Couldn't see clearly, but breathing caught my ear then I spotted it a few times as it surfaced. <b>Not sure what type of whale</b>. Traveling, feeding. I was looking for dolphins that were here 2 days ago when I heard the whale breathe right below the house in the bay. I looked down it was going under about 100' off shore. Definitely a big whale. I ran for my camera and it surfaced 3-4 times in front of the house but looking through my lens I had a hard time finding it each time.  I've only seen whales in Hawaii and Deception pass, so this was a treat.

<b>Commencement Bay - 7:30 p.m. - </b>It came into the cove at Jack Hyde Park near the rocks (less than 10 ft away from me). Thought it was a humpback but <b>could have been a gray whale?</b> it was Tuesday around 7:30pm. I was on the grass hill and spotted the spout so close to the dock, I couldn't believe my eyes. I believed there was a boat following much too close which is why I think it came into the shallow cove near the beach for a bit. Gray in color, lots of barnacles, no distinct dorsal (I'm a birder, not a whaler) and I remember seeing an orange spot on its fluke. Once it turned the corner, it picked up immense speed and followed the shoreline in the direction of Thea Foss and out of my view. Now that I've done a bit of research, I would say it looked much more like a Gray Whale. -Christina Felty

<b>Whale spouts in Commencement Bay this morning</b>. Not Orcas, too far away to identify. Last spouts seen <b>near the Port of Tacoma. Between 10am and 11am.</b> Baleen whales (my guess is 3). Not sure if humpbacks or other, not close enough. Have seen both humpbacks and grays before and could distinguish between those if I could have gotten a closer look. They were viewed from land on Tacoma side of bay, looked to be closer to Pt Brown side of bay. Could see spouts and backs, no view of fins or flukes. -Carol Styner

<b>Hood Canal - 1:20 p.m. - Gray Whale in Hood Canal</b>. This afternoon (4 June 2017; approx. 13:20 hr), a large (adult?) <b>gray whale swam past our house on Hood Canal</b>. It was swimming slowly, inside the line of boat mooring buoys, in water less than 25 ft deep, traveling in a NE direction, following the shoreline towards the mouth of the Union River near Belfair. Our house is located at 14xxx E State Route 106, <b>Belfair</b>, WA, approximately 5 miles SW of the mouth of the Union River, and approximately 2 miles NE of Twanoh State Park. -Toy Melchiors

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>1:15 p.m. - On Hood Canal</b> over the weekend we saw what we believe to be <b>a juvenile Gray Whale</b>. It was at least 30 feet in length and was dangerously close to the shoreline. It did surface further out later on, and no small dorsal was apparent as would be found in a minke and the tail was too large. Unfortunately we could not get our camera up quickly enough either time....It was heading back toward the mouth of the canal, about a mile from Twanoh State Park on Sunday around 2pm.  It was a pretty good surfacing and tail slap.  We were concerned that it was sick or lost because it was so close to the shore.  Hope it gets out of the Canal OK. -George Means

We headed north with a report of <b>orcas near Pt. Roberts, BC</b>, heading southeast, in our direction. By the time we arrived, the group of <b>Transients (Biggs)</b> had split, with 3 or 4 heading west out of range, but one male, beautiful <b>T101A</b>, was there for us. He was doing large, erratic circles around the five whale watch boats, surfacing a few times in a line, then reappearing in a completely different area! It was a privilege to share some time with this young (mid-twenties) orca as he went about his daily life. Heading home, we stopped to see the last few big Steller Sea Lions at the east end of Sucia Island, growling and preening. They will leave our area very soon to return north to the Bering Sea. One big eagle was spotted, and an osprey with a large branch for nest building was seen just as we left the marina in the morning. Another lovely day on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

<b>8:34 p.m. - Standing at Glendale Beach we've got a humpback</b> that just fluked. Feeding. I missed a fluke shot the one time we saw it deep dive but the downtime was short - like 3 minutes. This humpback was traveling the fastest I have ever seen a humpback travel. And just like that it was past us to the south.

<b>San Juans -</b> On June 3rd we hung out with <b>a humpback whale known as MMY0009 or MMY0001 "Frankenstein" as it headed south from Jones Island mid strait down San Juan Channel</b>. We left him/her heading south towards Cattle Point at approximately <b>5pm</b>. The whale would surface with one or two breaths and go down for about 7 minutes before re-surfacing. -Captains Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

<b>Hood Canal - 8:45 a.m. - Dabob Bay</b>, Hood Canal Whale Sighting. <b>Gray Whale off Bolton Peninsula,</b> Dabob Bay, (Quilcene), WA. 500 feet East of Quilcene Bay channel marker. Hopefully trying to get the hell away from all the Saturday shrimp fishing small boat traffic! S/he was only a couple hundred feet off the South tip of Bolton Peninsula (separates Quilcene Bay and Dabob Bay) swimming West, towards the channel marker. No pics, but a forever memory. S/he was 20 ft off my port bow, heading the opposite direction. -Brian Simmons

Sailing the extra nautical mile we met <b>Transient Orcas, T65A's, within sight of Vancouver</b>. As we approached <b>two humpback whales breached</b> about a mile ahead of the orcas. Returned by way of East Point and found 2 Peregrine Falcons. Evening light by Flattop began painting the picture of sunset. -Barbara and David

Coastal killer whales - Received a call at <b>1:40PM</b> from Ivy Reynolds, manager of the gift shop at <b>Cape Meares OR Lighthouse</b> at the same time <b>three orcas were about 1-2 miles offshore </b>from the lighthouse, heading north. <b>Two were adult males</b>. She also said that Travis Korb took a video of a predation event a few days ago from Cape Lookout in which orcas separated a gray whale mom from a calf, then chased the calf to the beach where it stranded, until the the adult gray whale chased the orcas away. The calf was not on the beach soon thereafter.

<b><br/><center>*</center><br/></b>
<b>4:30 p.m. - It is a humpback.</b> Currently near the <b>entrance to Totten Inlet</b>. It was logging on the surface for some time until it was startled by a barge and started moving again. Traveling slightly north then turning and going south. Cascadia Research has been notified. (Kim ID'd this humpback as the same one, "DOT", who was in Hammersley and Case Inlets the past 5-6 weeks). -Kim Merriman

We saw a whale (<b>humpback</b>?) that hung around for hours (about <b>1 pm to evening</b>) near <b>Windy Point/Steamboat Island </b>and points south <b>in Totten Inlet</b>. The whale jumped out of the water about 4 times and smacked its tail several times, other times just seem to float. What a treat!

<b>12:30 p.m. - A whale, possibly juvenile humpback</b> is headed west towards <b>Carlyon Beach/ Steamboat Island</b>. I could only watch from afar - would love to hear for sure what it is. Honestly I had just come up from a dive minutes prior and heard a loud blow. I watched it with binoculars from afar and am certain of whale, but not species. Definitely solitary. -Nick Wenzel
