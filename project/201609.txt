<b>9:40 a.m. - saw two whales</b> frequently blowing water spouts over by Salmon Beach. Could see all the way from the Gig Harbor side! They were pretty tall spouts!! Could not see the bodies, but they were moving fairly quickly and headed south <b>towards the Narrows Bridge</b>. (Humpbacks?) -Gaby Kinnear

For approximately one week, back from Monday, we've had <b>3 to 5 dolphins traveling back and forth through Hammersley Inlet</b> during the day and night. A lot of activity. Not sure what was see in Oakland Bay in Monday. -Brenda Rix

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:19 a.m. -</b> I'm watching <b>at least two porpoises swim between Dash Point and the south end of Vashon</b>. I feel fairly certain that they were porpoises because of the quick way they were swimming and their small size...the size and shape of the their dorsal fins looked much more like a type of porpoise. -Heidi Vincent

As the sun was setting, <b>a pair of humpbacks surfaced in Welbury Bay</b>, no more than 20 meters  off the south shore of the Scott Point peninsula. Pretty delightful. -Peter Reiner, <b>Salt Spring Island</b>
<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
 
A <b>pair of humpback whales passed within 100 feet of shore at Lime Kiln Point State Park</b> on Tuesday. They were headed north at 12:45 pm. One had a nick in its dorsal fin (as clearly visible in one of the photos). It would be interesting to know if it is individually known by that feature. -Andrew Redding

<b>6:00 p.m. - Saw a  humpback off of Redondo Beach or Woodmont Beach near Redondo - Puget Sound</b>, and then watching it still as its moves south down by Dash Point. There was a small and  irregular dorsal fin and he/she was a big. It surfaced real close and to our Woodmont beach a few times that I saw before he went south. It was one of those I was at my house looked out the window and there he was   He stayed over by Dash Point/ Brownspoint area for quite some time we could see his spray. -Mitzi Gligorea

Yes another glorious calm, sunny day for Mystic Sea's scenic trip through the San Juan islands to Salmon Bank, where a plethora of sea-birds gathered to feed on nature's bounty. Not only sea-birds but seals and <b>Minke whales</b> (smallest of the baleen whales) kept passengers intrigued with their appearances and disappearances as they made a number of directional changes. It's not often we are fortunate to see the beautiful tapered head of the Minke whale, but today's lunge-feeding provided that golden opportunity. Cruising on to <b>Smith and Minor Islands we spotted another Minke</b>, which has sustained wounds in front of, and on, the dorsal fin. Hopefully these wounds will heal with time... Growling Steller sea-lions jostling for a place on Whale Rocks greeted us as we sailed past their haul-out, giving it large with attitude! -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Once the <b>K16s</b> were identified, "Orcinus" headed north and, ten minutes later, found more <b>spread out whales in Swanson Channel</b> around <b>1030. J46 and J54 </b>were foraging together mid-channel and looked like they might have been either chasing a salmon or sharing one. <b>J44</b> moved north past this pair while they were foraging. J54 still looks too thin for his age but it was encouraging to see him try to catch fish with his older sister. -See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 103.

The oldest male in all 3 pods, <b>Mega (L41)</b> in all his beauty kelping in Active Pass.
The <b>L12s traveled through Active Pass today</b>, currently not a usual route for this family. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>Windsong (L121), Calypso (L94), and Ocean Sun (L25), Mega (L41), Joy (L119), Spirit (L22) and Matia (L77)</b>. Sunday we were privileged enough to watch the <b>L12s go through Active Pass</b>. It was incredible! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

It has been well over a year since I have had a good encounter with the <b>L12s, L77 "Matia" L94 "Calypso", L121 "Windsong", L25 "Ocean Sun", L41 "Mega" kelping beside L121 "Windsong"</b> . We so rarely get to see them up in our neck of the woods anymore so (Sept 25) was pretty awesome getting to watch them <b>come through Active Pass behind J pod, J27 "Blackberry", J34 "DoubleStuf", J17 "Princess Angeline" and J53 "Kiki"</b>. -Gary Sutton

Summer may be officially over, but it didn't seem that way today as Mystic Sea cruised through glassy seas and warm sunshine to Salmon Bank near San Juan Island. Here we encountered <b>members of K and L pod whales</b> from the endangered Southern Resident community, including <b>Scoter (K-25), his sister Spock (K-20), Racer (L72) and her 'sprouter' son Fluke (L-105)</b>, traveling within close proximity to one another as they searched for their traditional food, Chinook salmon. Hopefully the energized breaches and vigorous tail-slapping we saw mean they are finding enough of those energy bars before they begin their forays into Puget Sound in the fall in search of Chum salmon. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

<b>Js and some Ks in Boundary, K12s and K14s foraging north and south of Lime Kiln</b>, others still off sound end as of <b>1045</b>. We had K12s foraging off Lime Kiln from 10-1, K14s north, Ls south. All spread foraging not going anywhere pretty much. K12s were still off LK when we left. Only other whale I saw was L92 off Land Bank but then he went back south, as we left looked like boats between False Bay and Eagle as well. -Monika Wieland Shields

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1:21 p.m. - They're still echolocating</b>.
<br/><b>12:15 - Lots of echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone</b>. And it's quiet (ship wise) as well. Very cool! -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>12:35 p.m. - Loud calls and grunts</b>. Geez.. from about 12:35 to around 1:00 they made all kinds of cool sounds and calls. Hope that's them celebrating catching some fish! -Melissa Burke

<b>12:25 p.m. - I am hearing Ks loud and clear</b> as I type. Beautiful fall day to be out there I can only imagine
<br/><b>10:58 a.m. -  fairly loud S16 or S17 K calls</b>. 
<br/><b>10:45 a.m. - more intermittent calls, sounds like K calls</b>. 
<br/><b>10:37 a.m. - turned on Lime Kiln, hearing faint calls</b>. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

We were the first and only to find the sometimes elusive <b>L54 matriline, with L88 Wavewalker</b>, another lone male who who lost his mother and brother both in 2012. He now travels with of the <b>Southern Resident Killer Whales today just west of Sooke</b>, B.C. Vancouver Island. -Paul Pudwell

I reached the <b>eastern shore of Puget Sound off north Edmonds</b> just shy of sunset to watch this<b> humpback</b> who primarily was engaged in some excellent pec (pectoral fin) slapping most of the time I was viewing her/him. One breach, a few long dives, and more pec slapping then the whale was off, <b>northbound entering Possession Sound aiming towards Clinton/Mukilteo </b>in the waning light. Here's a peek at the pecs. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:55 p.m. -</b> Another dive, this one about 7 minutes. Surfaced now heading steadily northbound towards<b> Mukilteo/Clinton</b>. Still south end of Possession Sound. Thats where I leave her/him. Sweet.
<br/><b>6:39 p.m. - </b> This looks like a young whale. S/he is pec slappin her/his way north. I got here in time to see one breach in between repetition of dives and pec slapping. Currently on a dive between north Edmonds and Possession Point.
<br/><b>6:24 p.m. -  humpback is off north Edmonds</b> pec slapping! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>6:23pm humpback repeatedly breaching north sound</b> - line of sight <b>between north Edmonds and Scatchet head</b> - it's heading north to the east side of Whidbey island . Will post videos of breaches and side flukes slaps. Very active <b>Humpback Whale passing Edmonds</b> Washington this evening slowly heading northbound. Long distance videoing from North Edmonds shoreline looking west over north Puget Sound. -Stu Davidson

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

I watched two or more <b>humpback whales off Edmonds</b> last night 9/25/16 for 30 minutes. At <b>5:50 </b>they were opposite the ferry dock, going north. They breached frequently. Without binoculars I watched them continue toward Double Bluff on Whidbey Island. Seen until 6:20. -Ron Hebron

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/> 

Received a call from Vicky Hone Smith at <b>5:50 pm, reporting a Humpback whale off Edmonds</b>. Vicky was off Pt. Edward looking out across the marina. They had been watching it awhile, seeing blows and one pec fin slapping the water, it was logging on the surface and not diving or traveling and they were concerned it might be entangled or in distress. As we were talking, it breached, then again, and again! It seemed to be moving NE, and perhaps was just resting or doing pec slaps.

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:45 p.m. - Humpbacks off Edmonds.</b> -Elyse Sollito

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>2:50 p.m. - We just saw a whale in Elliot Bay</b>, not sure what type. Feeling blown away and super lucky! I first saw it between W Seattle and Myrtle Edwards. Since then, we've seen the spray as the whale heads west. -Chelsea Myers

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Watching from <b>West Seattle just saw spray. Just at the tip of Vashon. 12:35 pm</b>. Going North. -Dana Sheppard

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

At about <b>11:45 AM </b>on 9/25/16 - <b>Humpback whale in Colvos Passage</b>! We saw a single, small humpback whale traveling  about 40 ft offshore moving north. We were eating breakfast by the water and heard it breath and it was right there! We saw it surface 3 times until it was out of sight. -Julie Jacobsen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:33 a.m. -</b> One whale sighting, <b>Sunset Beach on Colvos</b>! So close to Vashon shore, maybe 300' out! -Kristy Hegnauer

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>11:21..</b> there may still be something <b>off Ruston, by the Tacoma Yacht Club </b>and the Grain Ship "Tiger Lilly". I saw something dive about 20 minutes ago, haven't seen it since. Could be on the other side of the ship though (on Vashon side) I didn't hear it breathe however, and I'm fairly confident I would hear it, it's pretty quiet out here, can hear music from the boats pasding. -Melissa Burke

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>10:34 a.m. - Mid channel of Colvos Passage</b> having just entered from <b>Narrows/Point Defiance</b>. Seeing it with binoculars from Pt. Defiance. -Ryan Rooks

Cool and overcast as we left the marina, but luckily with smooth waters and no wind. With no reports of whales at first, we headed south west, but shortly heard that<b> a group of Transients (Bigg's), were heading north east, moving fast, past San Juan Island</b>. We caught up with them at <b>Kelp Reef</b> in Canada, after a long but beautiful trip, waving to a pod of harbor porpoises on the way. There were <b>about 7-8 whales</b>, in two groups, with <b>one male (T60C)</b>, one fairly small juvenile, and the rest females. They were relentlessly porpoising north west,showing the incredible power of their speed, though with some directional changes. We had heard they had made a kill or two earlier, so seemed determined to plow on. With beautiful glassy water, big clouds, and the ever-beautiful Salish Sea scenery, we left them by Big and Little Darcy Islands. There were a few Steller Sea Lions in the water, but they were not on the menu today. The sun came out and everyone enjoyed the trip inter-island, through Pole Pass and home. All pictures taken with a 300 zoom and cropped. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Hello: Possible Minke? (confirmed <b>humpback</b> by others) We observed a whale (1-2. I saw one, others reported 2) <b>in northern Case Inlet off of the north side of Herron Island - Puget Sound</b>. Folks said that pictures confirmed as a Humpback, but as the whale blew, it surfaced in a sinuous motion, seemed narrow, and the dorsal fin was far to the rear; no flukes were displayed. Blows and surfacing were followed by dives lasting a few minutes. The whale did not breach...rather resembled a sea serpent. -Christine Mohr

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>5:25 PM.. Whale headed 1/4 mile north of Harstine Island bridge.</b> Two big, noisy, blows but did not surface much. -Gretchen Stewart

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>1 Humpback departing Totten Inlet 4:30ish pm towards Hope Island</b>. Circled the Island on the east side and turned around heading back towards Shelton. Several blows and a nice show of the full tail! Beautiful...-Tracy Parascand

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Apparently around <b>2:30 at least one of these animals ended up near Burfoot Park (Budd Inlet)</b> and then traveled across from there to Hunter Point (<b>Eld Inlet</b>). It is flat calm. Unfortunately I didn't see it and it passed right in front of my house! -Kim Merriman

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

We just saw <b>one humpback in front of Steamboat Marina at Eld Inlet </b>on the Hope Island side about<b> 2:30pm</b>. It was headed north. -Dee Ann Clayton Larsen

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>

Challenging sea conditions failed to deter Mystic Sea's resilient passengers today as <b>one of our known humpbacks, BCY0409 (Yogi</b> - also seen in Hawaii), zigzagged among the whitecaps off Flattop Island<b></b>, another of the wildlife reserves in the San Juans. Flying spume hit the decks along with the 'sweet' smell of whale breath carrying on the wind, as Yogi made several directional changes keeping everyone guessing as to which way next... Three breaches in a row caught photographers by surprise when we arrived on scene - did anybody out there get that shot? -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Breathtaking - there's no other word to describe today's encounter with the Southern Resident orcas. Dampness soon gave way to sunshine and sparkling seas after we left the dock, passing Colville Island on our route to the south side of San Juan Island where members of <b>L-pod, including Mega (L-41)</b>, the exquisitely marke<b>d Racer (L-72) and her son Fluke (L-105)</b> ranged freely with their family, grouping up for a photo-shot as they passed under the watchful eye of Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research. These are the most studied whales in the world, and the Center has been responsible for photo-identification studies on this endangered population since the start of Orca Survey in 1976. In addition, the orcas are currently being monitored by hexagram under NOAA's permit to collect images for health assessment. Chinook salmon is what they need to survive - and plenty of it. Our return route took us past Bird Rocks, which not only provides refuge to our feathered friends but also to Pacific Harbor seals and Steller sea-lions, one of which looked as though it had learned to fly! -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Here are a few photos of the <b>T100 and T65B transient (Bigg's) killer whale pods attacking a Steller sea lion between Point Hudson and Whidbey Island </b>on Sept. 19 2016. The killer whales appeared to attack the sea lion by ramming it head first, and by striking it with their tail flukes over and over again. They were using a technique that seems to  be pretty common when they target a Steller sea lion.   They start with a frenzy of attacks, then they swim away (100-300 yards) as if they've decided to move on, then they circle back and start another frenzy of attacks. Then they swim away again, and circle around for another attack.  They repeated this "attack, leave, circle back, and attack again" sequence over and over again! The sea lion must have been significantly injured, judging by his labored rolling around at the surface, but somehow he found shelter in a mat of floating bull kelp.  He wrapped himself in the kelp as much as possible, and this seemed to be a relatively successful strategy because the killer whales were more cautious with the tangle of bull kelp in their way.  I've seen this on multiple occasions, where seals or sea lions take shelter in or on bull kelp and it always seems to hinder the effectiveness of the killer whales attacks - at least for a while.  The killer whales don't seem to want to slash right through the kelp. It looks like they try to create powerful currents with their bursts of speed, and tail fluke kicks, to wash their prey away from the kelp. On this particular occasion T100 seemed to be doing most of the really hard work, but T65B also played a significant roll in the attack. Occasionally the younger pod members would slash at the sea lion, as if they were mimicking their mother's work.  14 year old male, T100C, didn't appear to be involved very much, if at all,  in the real attacking work at the surface. -Bart Rulon

Big flocks of sea birds on the water (known as bird piles) usually means food...Today was no exception, and after passing Colville Island, where numerous Pacific Harbor seals were hauled out on the rocks, Mystic Sea headed for <b>Smith &amp; Minor Islands Aquatic Reserve where we spotted a couple of Minke whales</b> (the smallest of the baleen whales) dipping and diving to take advantage of the rich nutritional offerings in the marine ecosystem. A Steller sea-lion showed off his catch when surfacing, and we were treated to a fleeting glimpse of two Pacific White-Sided Dolphins (also known as Lags) as well as Harbor porpoises, the smallest of the cetaceans we see here. The season may be drawing to a close, but every trip offers something different and no two days are ever the same. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Summer is lingering in the Salish Sea, with another beautiful, warm, sunny day as we left the marina a little early...which was good as the <b>reports came in of J pod way north of the coal docks (BC) but heading south</b>. After a 3 hour cruise through Georgia Strait, we caught up with them, slowly heading south. In the <b>group of about 20 orcas, we enjoyed a great visit with J36 Alki and calf J52 Sonic, J16 Slick and calf J50 Scarlet, J42 Echo,big males Mike J26 and Blackberry J27, J47 Notch and his mom J35 Tahlequah, and others in the J17 group</b>. They were foraging, with some breaching, tail slapping, and nice roll overs. At first they were fairly well spread out, but they grouped up tightly, which is such a beautiful sight to see! The water was glass smooth, perfect orca appreciation conditions! With a fond farewell, we head home through the sparkling late afternoon, catching a look at some harbor seals steaming in the sun.

My husband and I were on our private vessel and saw whales. ...This was about <b>noon, a little north of Lime Kiln</b>, a little south of Mosquito Pass. We killed our engine and drifted for over an hour while whales swam by on all sides. We heard blows, turned to see one whale, heard another blow, turned to see another, like whirling dervishes trying to see them all. Somewhere between one and two dozen. Also had our hydrophone in the water an hour earlier and heard them in the vicinity. Magical experience! These photos taken by my daughter Adrienne Domingus. -Cathryn Rice, Olalla, WA

Crew and passengers witnessed a remarkable phenomenon described by scientists in a new study published just this summer-<b>humpback whales interfering with hunting transient killer whales</b>. Doesn't seem to matter what species they're hunting, the humpbacks don't like it. Scientists continue to debate the reason for this "vigilante" behaviour, which has been documented at multiple sites around the world over decades. Now they can add <b>southern Vancouver Island to the list...The T100 and T65B families of transient killer whales. Five whales in total....4 humpbacks we think</b>. Several times, the orcas retreated to regroup as if they were contemplating their next move. Or waiting for the humpbacks to go away. The stand-off ended with the transients swimming off, apparently deciding that four angry humpbacks weren't worth the trouble. Score: Team Humpback 1, Team Orca 0. It's not known whether Team Sea Lion survived its injuries or was attacked again later. -Eagle Wing Tours  

<br/><br/><center>*</center><br/>
<b>An orca cruises past the humpbacks, trying to get to the sea lion hiding among them. The humpbacks grouped together, blocking access to the sea lion, thrashing their tails and exhaling forcefully in an aggressive or agitated behaviour we call trumpeting. They repeatedly advanced on the orcas.</b> -Valerie Shore, September 11, 2016

Also an interesting thing we observed today <b>at Lime Kiln: a humpback whale came north into the southbound residents and started trumpeting with every surfacing as it came within a few hundred yards of the whales</b>. It was fluking on every surface and then turned west and wasn't seen again....Just ID'd the HB as <b>BCY0409 - Yogi.</b> -Monika Wieland

Headed out from Snug Harbor at<b> 4:00 PM </b>on Saturday, September 10 hoping to see southern residents. We knew some were down south and started to head that way but then got a report of whales up north which was closer and probably calmer conditions. We caught up with the <b>J16's on the south side of Saturna Island</b>, leisurely, and I mean leisurely (about 1.5 knots), traveling along. Also present were <b>J27 and his sister J31 of the J11's and I believe J28, J35 and J47 of the J17's</b>. I didn't have any images of the <b>J17's</b> until the end and I presume J54 was tucked down in as there were calves present. They were grouped in two very tight groups for the most part interchanging groupings periodically. They seemed very relaxed and unphased by a large container ship directly in their path. We were hoping the kiddos would get rambunctious but even they were perfectly content with their leisurely weekend swim through the beautiful Salish Sea. Here is the big guy J26 and little sister J36 swimming in perfect unison and harmony. -Debbie Stewart

Left the marina with a mild breeze and sunshine, but with a definite fall feeling in the air! With reports of <b>many resident orcas heading southwest down Haro Strait</b>, we eagerly headed out to <b>Salmon Bank </b>to catch up with the leaders, who were moving pretty fast, with pauses to fish and play. We had a great visit with males <b>L89 Solstice (23 yrs old) and L85 Mystery (25 yrs old), females L77 Matia (29 yrs old) and her young daughter L-119 Joy (4 yrs old), as well as female L-22 Spirit</b> (est. 45 yrs old). There were some big breaches, spy hopping, rolling around, tail slaps, and pec slapping, though overall they seemed pretty intent on heading southwest. On the way home, the wind died down as we got some great looks at the magnificent Stellar Sea Lions on Whale rocks, and enjoyed the beauty of the small islands around Lopez. All photos taken with a 300 zoom lens and cropped. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

<b>J16s</b> were also there so they weren't alone. Sounds like whales basically <b>spread from offshore of Salmon Bank to Swanson Channel and across both sides of Haro</b>.

The leading group of <b>Southern Residents, streaming out to Hein Bank from San Juan Island</b>. A spread out "super pod" was reported, with small groups of all three pods moving quickly. We caught up with <b>K35 Sonata, K33 Tika, K21 Cappuccino, K44 Ripple, L47 Ripple and her daughter L91 Muncher, with her calf L-122</b>. They were actively fishing at times, with some playful breaches, spy hops, and tail slaps. After spending some beautiful time with them, we headed east toward home, stopping to see the imposing Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, and enjoying a trip through the rocky islands around Lopez. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

...Although the resident orca used to come all of the way into the Salish Sea in large groups with complete pods, they now typically spread out over a large expanse of water by the time they pass by Race Rocks. I surmise this spread is due to a spread or low density of prey (Chinook salmon) in recent years as compared to decades ago. After all, there were 1.5 to 1.9 million Chinook salmon caught per year by humans (WDF Technical Report No. 76, 1983) from stocks utilizing the Strait of Juan de Fuca in those early years of Orca Survey, and the average fish was 15-17.5 pounds;... -Center for Whale Research staff CWR encounter 95

Incredible night with the <b>T60s</b>. They were continually on the hunt and made several kills. That didn't stop when they reached <b>Colville Island (SE of Orcas Island) where T60, T60E, and T60F</b> entered the small cove/crack on the southeast side of the island. I didn't even realize a whale could fit in there, let alone three! ...light was fading,  but it was so cool to watch T60E face off with two seals, have mom come out of the cove and appear to push her kiddo (who was probably blocking the entrance), and then moments later the youngest zoomed out of the cove as well and followed her mom and older sibling off to check out other seals hauled out nearby. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

<b>Admiralty Inlet - T34s, T36s, T37s, T65As, T99s - Early morning</b> reports had orcas <b>northbound</b> in Puget Sound. Approx.<b> 10:00 am</b> we first caught sight of three lovely groups spread loosely gliding along in the calm waters of morning. <b>T65As just north of Point No Point and the two larger groups surfaced more inshore</b>.  Their northbound travels continued, mostly just in travel mode, surfacing in regular intervals then longish dives, every once in a while staying down for 6-7 minutes or longer. The T65As most of the time hung to the outside to themselves. At one point a large group surfaced after a very long dive heading for shore in a line...it was breathtaking. This directional change and movement had every look to be pod on the hunt, but that did not happen. That group then cruised well inshore as others stayed  more offshore in the lead. No kill was witnessed in my time on scene. Watching so many fins surface at once so tightly clustered in their home waters pierces ones soul. We left for a time and returned to find them again further north. We left them still northbound off <b>north end of Marrowstone around 12:55 p.m</b>, left superpod of Ts (including T37s, T65As, T99s) in couple of groups powering northbound nearing Fort Flagler, very much Flagler side of Admiralty.. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Could see that he was dark grey or black. It was a small curved dorsal. The color wasn't as black and shiny as an orca. It appeared dark gray. In fact, it looked more like a pseudorca than any of the other pictures on your site. It was probably about 1/8 mile away and I looked through my high-powered scope and saw it surface about 4 times, but it was fast and I couldn't see as much as I would have liked. -Carole Baker

Great day with resident orcas. This is <b>K13 Skagit spyhopping in Swanson Channel</b> with her daughter, <b>K27 Deadhead</b> and grandson, <b>K44 Ripple</b> in the background. K37 Rainshadow surfacing near False Bay on San Juan Island from Saturday morning. Rainshadow was born in 2003. He is at an age where he will start going through a noticeable growth spurt. His dorsal fin will begin to sprout and grow taller, his pectoral flippers will increase in size, and his tail will begin to curl on the ends. All apart of growing up and enduring the gawky teenage years! It will be very fun watching Rainshadow grow over the next 10 years. -Katie Jones

We ended up with a gorgeous day of sunny, blue skies and a glass calm sea....Mystic Sea departed Anacortes at 10:45am with reports of transients near Smith Island traveling south. Once we arrived at <b>Lopez Island</b>, we went 15 miles due south to catch up with our first group of transients for today, the <b>T60s</b>. We stayed with this group for about half hour, when we saw in the distance another group of transients who seemed to be having lunch. Captain Monte cruised over just in time to see this group, the <b>T65s</b>, while they finished off a seal. We stayed and watched as they continued to feed on other seals, and even got a mouthful of seagull! This group included a large bull with a 6 foot dorsal fin, and several females and calves...-Amy W., Mystic Sea
