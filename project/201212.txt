Ken Balcomb was on the Coho ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles this morning at<b> 11 am </b>when he saw a pod of <b>orcas </b>in the <b>Strait of Juan de Fuca</b>, heading eastward. 
<br/>*<br/>
<b>K pod</b> seems to be coming north out of <b>Admiralty Inlet </b>according to hydrophone reports and a call from Mike Waitt, who saw two orcas approaching <b>Lagoon Point</b>, heading north at <b>8:33 this morning</b> (Could these be the Transients still following K pod?).
<br/>*<br/>
<b>8:32am -</b> I just heard a <b>call</b>.
<br/>Rachel Haight 
<br/>*<br/>

Not too many of them from what I saw, but it's hard to say, as they have not been surfacing much. An occasional three or four spouts, then down. They appear much closer to the east side of the sound than the first group that came through.
<br/>Jon Ehret 
<br/>*<br/>

We just got a call from Brandon Befosse reporting an incident from last Friday, at around <b>5:30 or 6 pm at the Ruston Fishing Pier</b>. Brandon and about 20 others were jigging for squid off the short pier, with lights on &amp; their lines in the water, when <b>a 30' gray whale </b>came by the pier. It came right through their lines and snapped at least 5 of the lines, went under the pier and back out again. It was swimming just under the surface of the water, and when it left it was headed toward the Port of Tacoma.
<br/><br/>
<b>December 27, 2012</b>

I did my first watch for <b>Orcas </b>today and saw two whales at approximately Lat 47.917323. Long 122.320573 in<b> Possession Sound along the Mukilteo shoreline</b>. The time of this sighting was<b> 2:45 p.m.</b> They were in Possession Sound swimming along the Mukilteo shoreline - not that far out. What I saw was this. First I just saw a fin and back going in and out of the water. Then another fin and back and then the two jumped almost straight up out of the water together. Then they were both swimming along and my view was blocked by a tree. I could see no markings at all. Just some white when they jumped out of the water. I am making an assumption that they were Orcas but really would not have recognized them specifically as Orcas since I was so far away and didn't see any markings. I was on a bluff about 1000 feet away from the water maybe 300 feet elevation and about two miles south of the Mukilteo Clinton Ferry on 92nd Street just past Sunset Lane. The spot was a good one, but I need to get closer to the water. I could see into Saratoga Passage and Port Susan on the other side of Gedney Island and then behind to Puget Sound.

Noon - We received an early Christmas present when a <b>pod of orca</b> passed by our home at point <b>Richmond Beach</b> near gig harbor on Colvos passage. I'm guessing that this must have been <b>J or K pod</b> due to the number (20ish).

Then they headed out deeper and couldn't really see where they went - possibly toward Powell River or down channel by Hornby Island. What a treat - would they have been residents?

Received this report from Susan MacKay of Whales and Dolphins BC at about <b>3:30 pm</b>: Thought you'd like to know that we just had the<b> Southern Residents</b> up our way.... <b>Malaspina Strait passing Powell River</b> then angling towards Vivian Rocks by Harwood Island. I knew they would come as they do every December. Lost sight of them now as they turned and headed towards Vancouver Island and the West side of Texada.

I saw <b>about 8 orcas heading east past East Point on Saturna Island at 9:00 am </b>this morning. They were moving slowly but deliberately with a full flood tide. Saw one spy hop. I couldn't get good photos for ID, but here's a shot of 2 orcas surfacing by the very crowded Boiling Reef haul out. Bellingham is in the background.

From Whales and Dolphins BC:  Orca - <b>Probably Transients (Bigg's) near Powell River BC</b>.
<br/>*<br/>
From <b>Carkeek Park</b> (North Seattle) I watched an unidentified pod of <b>6-10 orca traveling north through Puget Sound from 10:30-11:30am</b>. This lovely individual continued northward at a steady pace east of mid channel, while the others were traveling west of mid channel.
<br/>Alisa Lemire Broooks

Oy it was a nasty cold whale tracking day. After finding them at <b>Dilworth</b> (on Vashon) they continued to move southbound and were about half way to Point Robinson when they stalled out and moved back and forth from Vashon, mid channel and ultimately closer to <b>3 Tree Point</b>. Seemed like they were going all directions but our way. With more squalls kicking in, and fog coming across the water we lost track of them just North of Three Tree point. Jeff Hogan reported looking farther North from the Seattle side but didn't see them. Could be they turned and went fully South after I had to abandon the watch or they could have been lost in rain and fog as they went North again. Kelly Burns Keenan posted some of the photos she took today at the Preserve Our Islands facebook page. Pretty far for ID's but we did have some photos and ID's were <b>at least some K pod whales</b> so residents are at hand. Really don't think we had all of K pod though - just didn't see that many. Maybe 10 with lots of back and forth action.

<b>All 3 pods </b>made their way north in <b>Haro Strait</b>. Love these guys so much. So important to make sure we provide them the best habitat we can. Also, it's important that people stop supporting marine parks, it's tortuous for orcas. This is the wild, this is the real sea world.

At <b>Ft. Casey</b> about <b>12:25</b> - blows to the south, coming up from <b>Lagoon Pt</b>., accompanied by a submarine and two CG tenders. They moved steadily north past Port Townsend and <b>Pt. Wilson </b>over the next 45 min. in mid-channel, so no IDs. I was at <b>Admiralty Head </b>while Ken Balcomb was at Pt. Wilson, but they were too far from both shores to get IDs. The ferry went way off course, apparently to go whale watching while stopped off the Port Townsend Marine Science Center. No clear direction of travel out of Admiralty, but Ken saw a breach <b>between Ft. Casey and Partridge Point about 1:45</b>.

About <b>1:30</b> saw a bunch due north of <b>Point No Point</b>. [<b>Orcas</b>] came straight at the point, rounded the point and headed south and angled out into the Sound. Last I saw, they were still southbound. Once out in the middle of the Sound, saw one breach several times. I don't know how many--there seemed to be two groups each having several Orcas. One was a male--biggest dorsal fin I've ever seen. They were traveling fairly fast--seemed to be "on a mission." Amazing, amazing sight from Pt. No Point! I put my camera on continuous shooting mode and probably got 300 photos. I'll post some pics soon.

The endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales visited <b>Vashon and Maury Islands</b>, searching for salmon. As they passed Point Robinson, they burst into playful antics that have to be seen to be believed: cartwheels, breaches, tail slaps, spyhops, and beautiful synchronized swimming in their tightly knit family groups.

<b>Noon - </b>I saw a <b>huge pod </b>that hung out in front of <b>Lincoln park</b> after noon today! Nervous seal lion bull swimming back and forth 15 feet from shore. So COOL!!! There were definitely more than 10 and the guy next to me thought 20. The one that brought up the rear, kind of hanging to the east of a tug boat and its ship it towed had a very tall dorsal fin and BIG. They took their time going by, about a 30 minute chance to view them I'd say.

Ed &amp; I boarded a ferry, wound our way to Point No Point to spend a day wandering the shores along the orca path. On the beach &amp; in the company of many excited people (many names we recognize from Orca Network FB page) we shared the excitement of seeing these beautiful whales. <b>The pods were spread across the inlet, north/south, east/west</b>. The wind whipping fierce, waves rolling sometimes 5-6 feet in height just out where the tide rip rumbles off the point. The <b>orca passed in groups of 2-5</b> heading southbound stalling to lunge, breach, spyhop..humbling &amp; thrilling their human bystanders quite wildly. The baby<b> J49</b> surfaced very close to shore in &amp; amongst these bonded families of orca. They &amp; we continued this journey<b> southward, past Eglon</b>. At last sight we saw one female <b>nearing Kingston</b> (could it be J2 Granny?). Another exhilarating day spent exploring this magnificent place we all share &amp; call home.
<br/><b>4:10 - </b>From bluff above <b>Kingston ferry</b> saw one female still southbound past <b>Apple Tree point</b>. Heavy rain has moved over the area.
